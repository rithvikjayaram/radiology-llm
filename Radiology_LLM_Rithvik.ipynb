We will discuss the following subjects: Dif\\nferential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases Introduction\\nIntroduction:\\nSecundary lobules. The centrilobular artery (in blue: oxygen-poor blood) and the terminal bronchiole run in the center. Lymphatics and veins (in red: oxygen-rich blood) run within t\\nhe interlobular septa\\nAnatomy of Secondary lobule:\\nKnowledge of the lung anatomy is essential for understanding HRCT. The interpretation of interstitial lung diseases is based on the type of involvement of the secondary lobule. The \\nsecondary lobule is the basic anatomic unit of pulmonary structure and function. It is the smallest lung unit that is surrounded by connective tissue septa. It measures about 1-2 cm\\n and is made up of 5-15 pulmonary acini, that contain the alveoli for gas exchange. The secondary lobule is supplied by a small bronchiole or terminal bronchiole in the center, whic\\nh is parallelled by the centrilobular artery. The pulmonary veins and lymphatics run in the periphery of the lobule within the interlobular septa. Under normal conditions only a few\\n of these very thin septa can be seen. There are two lymphatic systems: a central network, that runs along the bronchovascular bundle towards the centre of the lobule and a peripher\\nal network, that is located within the interlobular septa and along the pleural linings. Centrilobular area in blue and perilymphatic area in yellow. Centrilobular area is the centr\\nal part of the secundary lobule. It is usually the site of diseases, that enter the lung through the airways ( i.e. hypersensitivity pneumonitis, respiratory bronchiolitis, centrilo\\nbular emphysema ). Perilymphatic area is the peripheral part of the secundary lobule. It is usually the site of diseases, that are located in the lymphatics of in the interlobular s\\nepta ( i.e. sarcoid, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary edema). These diseases are usually also located in the central network of lymphatics that surround the bronchovascular bu\\nndle.\\nBasic Interpretation:\\nA structured approach to interpretation of HRCT involves the following questions: Typical UIP with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fi\\nbrosis (IPF) These morphologic findings have to be combined with the history of the patient and important clinical findings. When we study patients with HRCT, we have to realize tha\\nt we are looking at a selected group of patients. Common diseases like pneumonias, pulmonary emboli, cardiogenic edema and lungcarcinoma are already ruled out. This means that uncom\\nmon diseases like Sarcoidosis, Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Lymphangitic carcinomatosis, Usual Interstitial Pneumonitis (UIP) and many others become \\nregular HRCT diagnoses and can be real Aunt Minnies. Image\\nAunt Minnie of a typical UIP.\\nReticular pattern:\\nIn the reticular pattern there are too many lines, either as a result of thickening of the interlobular septa or as a result of fibrosis as in honeycombing.\\nSeptal thickening:\\nThickening of the lung interstitium by fluid, fibrous tissue, or infiltration by cells results in a pattern of reticular opacities due to thickening of the interlobular septa. Altho\\nugh thickening of the interlobular septa is relatively common in patients with interstitial lung disease, it is uncommon as a predominant finding and has a limited differential diag\\nnosis (Table). Smooth septal thickening is usually seen in interstitial pulmonary edema (Kerley B lines on chest film); lymphangitic spread of carcinoma or lymphoma and alveolar pro\\nteinosis. Nodular or irregular septal thickening occurs in lymphangitic spread of carcinoma or lymphoma; sarcoidosis and silicosis. Focal septal thickening in lymphangitic carcinoma\\ntosis On the left we see focal irregular septal thickening in the right upper lobe in a patient with a known malignancy. This finding is typical for lymphangitic carcinomatosis. The\\nre are also additional findings, that support this diagnosis like mediastinal lymph nodes and a nodular lesion in the left lung, that probably represents a metastasis. Pulmonary lym\\nphangitic carcinomatosis (PLC) In 50% of patients the septal thickening is focal or unilateral. This finding is helpful in distinguishing PLC from other causes of interlobular septa\\nl thickening like Sarcoidosis or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Hilar lymphadenopathy is visible in 50% and usually there is a history of malignancy. Identical findings can be seen in\\n patients with lymphoma and in children with HIV infection, who develop Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP), a rare benign infiltrative lymphocytic disease. Septal thickening\\n and ground-glass opacity with a gravitational distribution in a patient with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. On the left a patient who had a CT to rule out pulmonary embolism. There i\\ns a combination of smooth septal thickening and ground-glass opacity with a gravitational distribution. The diagnosis based on this CT was cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic p\\nulmonary edema generally results in a combination of septal thickening and ground-glass opacity. There is a tendency for hydrostatic edema to show a perihilar and gravitational dist\\nribution. Thickening of the peribronchovascular interstitium, which is called peribronchial cuffing, and fissural thickening are also common. Common additional findings are an enlar\\nged heart and pleural fluid. Usually these patient are not imaged with HRCT as the diagnosis is readily made based on clinical and radiographic findings, but sometimes unsuspected h\\nydrostatic pulmonary edema is found. Alveolar proteinosis On the left a patient with both septal thickening and ground glass opacity in a patchy distribution. Some lobules are affec\\nted and others are not. This combination of findings is called 'crazy paving'. Crazy paving was thought to be specific for alveolar proteinosis, but is also seen in many other disea\\nses such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, sarcoidosis,\\nnonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (COP), adult respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary hemorrhage. Alveolar proteinosis is a rare diffuse lung dise\\nase of unknown etiology characterized by alveolar and interstitial accumulation of a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain-positive phospholipoprotein derived from surfactant. Honeycombi\\nng in a patient with UIP\\nHoneycombing:\\nHoneycombing is defined by the presence of small cystic spaces with irregularly thickened walls composed of fibrous tissue. Honeycomb cysts often predominate in the peripheral and s\\nubpleural lung regions regardless of their cause. Subpleural honeycomb cysts typically occur in several contiguous layers. This finding can allow honeycombing to be distinguished fr\\nom paraseptal emphysema in which subpleural cysts usually occur in a single layer. Honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis in UIP. The case on the left shows subpleural honeycomb c\\nysts in several contiguous layers. There is also a lower lobe predominance and widespread traction bronchiectasis. These findings are typical for Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP).\\n UIP or 'end-stage lung' is a pathology diagnosis and usually shown at lungbiopsy, when honeycombing is visible. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), accounts for more than 60% of t\\nhe cases of UIP. UIP with lung fibrosis is also a common pattern of auto-immune disease and drug-related lung injury. A long list of drugs have been implicated, but this pattern is \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Scroll through the images. On the left another case of UIP. The lower zone predominance is demonstrated when yo\\nu scroll through the images. Notice the ground glass opacity in the left lower lobe as a result of fibrous tissue replacing the air in the alveoli.\\nNodular pattern:\\nThe distribution of nodules shown on HRCT is the most important factor in making an accurate diagnosis in the nodular pattern. In most cases small nodules can be placed into one of \\nthree categories: perilymphatic, centrilobular or random distribution. Random refers to no preference for a specific location in the secondary lobule. Perilymphatic distribution In \\npatients with a perilymphatic distribution, nodules are seen in relation to pleural surfaces, interlobular septa and the peribronchovascular interstitium. Nodules are almost always \\nvisible in a subpleural location, particularly in relation to the fissures. Centrilobular distribution In certain diseases, nodules are limited to the centrilobular region. Unlike p\\nerilymphatic and random nodules, centrilobular nodules spare the pleural surfaces. The most peripheral nodules are centered 5-10mm from fissures or the pleural surface. Random distr\\nibution Nodules are randomly distributed relative to structures of the lung and secondary lobule. Nodules can usually be seen to involve the pleural surfaces and fissures, but lack \\nthe subpleural predominance often seen in patients with a perilymphatic distribution.\\nAlgorithm for nodular pattern:\\nThe algorithm to distinguish perilymphatic, random and centrilobular nodules is the following: If pleural nodules are absent or few in number, the distribution is likely centrilobul\\nar.\\n* If pleural nodules are visible, the pattern is either random (miliary) or perilymphatic.\\n* If there are pleural nodules and also nodules along the central bronchovascular interstitium and along interlobular septa, you are dealing with a periplymphatic distribution.\\n* If the nodules are diffuse and uniformly distributed, it is likely a random distribution.\\nPerilymphatic distribution:\\nPerilymphatic nodules are most commonly seen in sarcoidosis. They also occur in silicosis, coal-worker's pneumoconiosis and lymphangitic spread of carcinoma. Notice the overlap in d\\nifferential diagnosis of perilymphatic nodules and the nodular septal thickening in the reticular pattern. Sometimes the term reticulonodular is used. Sarcoidosis On the left a typi\\ncal case of perilymphatic distribution of nodules in a patient with sarcoidosis. Notice the nodules along the fissures indicating a perilymphatic distribution (red arrows). Always l\\nook carefully for these nodules in the subpleural region and along the fissures, because this finding is very specific for sarcoidosis. Typically in sarcoidosis there is an upper lo\\nbe and perihilar predominance and in this case we see the majority of nodules located along the bronchovascular bundle (yellow arrow). Sarcoidosis On the left another typical case o\\nf sarcoidosis. In addition to the perilymphatic nodules, there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes, which is also typical for sarcoidosis. In end stage sarcoidosis we will see fibrosi\\ns, which is also predominantly located in the upper lobes and perihilar. Ill defined centrilobular nodules of ground glass density in a patient with hypersensitivity pneumonitis\\nCentrilobular distribution:\\nCentrilobular nodules are seen in diseases, that enter the lung through the airways. The pathogens enter the central area of the secondary lobule via the terminal bronchiole: In man\\ny cases centrilobular nodules are of ground glass density and ill defined (figure). They are sometimes called acinair nodules.\\nTree-in-bud:\\nIn centrilobular nodules the recognition of 'tree-in-bud' is of value for narrowing the differential diagnosis. Tree-in-bud describes the appearance of an irregular and often nodula\\nr branching structure, most easily identified in the lung periphery. It represents dilated and impacted (mucus or pus-filled) centrilobular bronchioles. Tree-in-bud almost always in\\ndicates the presence of: Typical Tree-in-bud appearance in a patient with active TB. On the left a tree-in-bud is seen. In the proper clinical setting suspect active endobronchial s\\npread of TB. In most patients with active tuberculosis, the HRCT shows evidence of bronchogenic spread of disease even before bacteriologic results are available (6). Random distrib\\nution of nodules in miliary tuberculosis\\nRandom distribution:\\nOn the left a patient with random nodules as a result of miliary TB. The random distribution is a result of the hematogenous spread of the infection. Small random nodules are seen i\\nn: Sarcoidosis usually has a perilymphatic distribution. However, when it is very extensive, it spreads along the lymphatics in the bronchovascular bundle to the periphery of the lu\\nng and may reach the centrilobular area. This may result in a combined perilymphatic-centrilobular pattern which can simulate the random pattern. Langerhans cell histiocytosis: earl\\ny nodular stage before the typical cysts appear. Here a typical random nodular pattern in a patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is an uncommon disease characterise\\nd by multiple irregular cysts in patients with nicotine abuse. LCH in the early phase is a nodular disease (figure). These nodules eventually cavitate and become cysts. As in all sm\\noking related diseases, there is an upper lobe predominance.\\nHigh Attenuation pattern:\\nDark bronchus sign in ground glass opacity. Complete obscuration of vessels in consolidation. Increased lung attenuation is called ground-glass-opacity (GGO) if there is a hazy incr\\nease in lung opacity without obscuration of underlying vessels and is called consolidation if the increase in lung opacity obscures the vessels. In both ground glass and consolidati\\non the increase in lung density is the result of replacement of air in the alveoli by fluid, cells or fibrosis. In GGO the density of the intrabronchial air appears darker as the ai\\nr in the surrounding alveoli. This is called the dark bronchussign In consolidation, there is exclusively air left in the bronchi. This is called the air bronchogram.\\nGround-glass opacity:\\nGround-glass opacity (GGO) represents: So ground-glass opacification may either be the result of air space disease (filling of the alveoli) or interstitial lung disease (i.e. fibros\\nis). The location of the abnormalities in ground glass pattern can be helpfull: Broncho-alveolar cell carcinoma with ground-glass opacity and consolidation The ground glass pattern \\nitself is rather unspecific. Not suprisingly, there is a big overlap in the causes of ground-glass opacity and consolidation and some diseases may present with both areas of ground-\\nglass and consolidation. On the left we see consolidation and ground-glass opacity in a patient with persistent chest abnormalities and weight loss without signs of infection. This \\nsuggested a chronic disease. There is no honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis, so we can rule out fibrosis. The weight loss is suggestive of a malignant disease. Histology reveal\\ned broncho-alveolar cell carcinoma Broncho-alveolar cell carcinoma (BAC) may present as: LEFT: No fibrosis, so potentially treatable lung disease. RIGHT: Fibrosis, so no treatable l\\nung disease. Treatable or not treatable? Ground-glass opacity is nonspecific, but a highly significant finding since 60-80% of patients with ground-glass opacity on HRCT have an act\\nive and potentially treatable lung disease. In the other 20-40% of the cases the lung disease is not treatable and the ground-glass pattern is the result of fibrosis. In those cases\\n there are usually associated HRCT findings of fibrosis, such as traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing. The images show two cases with GGO, one without fibrosis and potentially t\\nreatable and the other with traction bronchiectasis indicating fibrosis. Non specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP). Notice lower lobe predominance. Here two images af a patient w\\nith GGO as the dominant pattern. In addition there is traction bronchiectasis indicating the presence of fibrosis. This case is one of the possible patterns of nonspecific interstit\\nial pneumonia (NSIP). NSIP is characterized histologically by a relatively uniform pattern of cellular interstitial inflammation associated with variable degrees of fibrosis. As in \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia) it mainly involves the dependent regions of the lower lobes, but NSIP lacks the extensive fibrosis with honeycombing. NSIP may be idiopathic or as\\nsociated with collagen vascular diseases or exposure to drugs or chemicals. NSIP has a relative good prognosis and the majority of patients respond to treatment with corticosteroids\\n. This outcome is quite different from that seen in UIP, which has a poor prognosis.\\nMosaic attenuation:\\nThe term mosaic attenuation is used to describe density differences between affected and non-affected lung areas. There are patchy areas of black and white lung. The role of the rad\\niologist is to determine which part is abnormal: the black or the white lung. When ground glass opacity presents as mosaic attenuation consider: Three different causes of mosaic att\\nenuation It can be difficult to distinguish these three entities. There are two diagnostic hints for further differentiation: If the vesses are difficult to see in the 'black' lung \\nas compared to the 'white' lung, than it is likely that the 'black' lung is abnormal. Then there are two possibilities: obstructive bronchiolitis or chronic pulmonary embolism. Some\\ntimes these can be differentiated with an expiratory scan. If the vessels are the same in the 'black' lung and 'white' lung, then you are looking at a patient with infiltrative lung\\n disease, like the one on the right with the pulmonary hemmorrhage. Temporary bronchiolitis with air trapping is seen in: Mosaic pattern in a patient with hypersensitivity pneumonit\\nis On the left a patient with ground glass pattern in a mosaic distribution. Some lobules are involved and others are not. The differential diagnosis is hypersensitivity pneumonitis\\n, bronchiolitis or thromboembolic disease. The history was typical for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis usually presents with centrilobular nodules of grou\\nnd glass density (acinar nodules). When they are confluent, HRCT shows diffuse ground glass. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an allergic lung disease caused by the inhalation o\\nf antigens contained in a variety of organic dusts. Farmer's lung is the best-known HP syndrome and results from the inhalation of fungal organisms that grow in moist hay or exposur\\ne to birds as pets (1). HP usually presents in two forms either as ground glass in a mosaic distribution as in this case or as centrilobular nodules of ground glass density (acinar \\nnodules). Mosaic pattern in a patient with chronic thromboemboli On the left a patient with ground glass pattern in a mosaic distribution. The clue here is the enlargement of pulmon\\nary arteries (arrow) in the areas of ground glass. The ground glass appearance is the result of hyperperfused lung adjacent to oligemic lung with reduced vessel caliber due to chron\\nic thromboembolic disease. On the left another patient with ground glass pattern in a mosaic distribution. Again the ground glass appearance is the result of hyperperfused lung with\\n large vessels adjacent to oligemic lung with small vessels due to chronic thromboembolic disease. Emboli adherent to the wall and intravascular septa are typical for chronic thromb\\noemboli in which partial recanalization took place. Crazy Pavin in a patient with Alveolar proteinosis.\\nCrazy Paving:\\nCrazy Paving is a combination of ground glass opacity with superimposed septal thickening (5). It was first thought to be specific for alveolar proteinosis, but later was also seen \\nin other diseases. Crazy Pavin can also be seen in:\\nConsolidation:\\nConsolidation is synonymous with airspace disease. When you think of the causes of consolidation, think of 'what is replacing the air in the alveoli'? Is it pus, edema, blood or tum\\nor cells (Table on the left). Even fibrosis as in UIP, NSIP and long standing sarcoidosis can replace the air in the alveoli and cause consolidation. Acute consolidation is seen in:\\n Chronic consolidation is seen in: Most patients who are evaluated with HRCT, will have chronic consolidation, which limits the differential diagnosis. Two patients with chronic con\\nsolidations as a result of COP (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia) On the left two cases with chronic consolidation. There are patchy non-segmental consolidations in a subpleural and\\n peripheral distribution. The differential diagnosis is the same as the list above. The final diagnosis was cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). In chronic eosinophilic pneumonia\\n the HRCT findings will be the same, but there will be eosinophilia. In fibrosis there will be other signs of fibrosis like honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis. Bronchoalveolar \\ncarcinoma can also look like this. Organizing pneumonia (OP) Organizing pneumonia represents an inflammatory process in which the healing process is characterized by organization an\\nd cicatrization of the exudate rather than by resolution and resorption. It is also described as 'unresolved pneumonia'. If no cause can be identified it is called cryptogenic organ\\nizing pneumonia (COP). It was described in earlier years as Bronchiolitis-obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Patients with COP typically present with a several-month history of\\n nonproductive cough. Many cases are idiopathic, but OP may also be seen in patients with pulmonary infection, drug reactions, collagen vascular disease, Wegener's granulomatosis an\\nd after toxic-fume inhalation. Chronic eosinophilic granuloma On the left a case of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. It was a patient with low-grade fever, progressive shortness of b\\nreath and an abnormal chest radiograph. There was a marked eosinophilia in the peripheral blood. Like in COP we see patchy non-segmental consolidations in a subpleural distribution.\\n Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is an idiopathic condition characterized by extensive filling of alveoli by an infiltrate consisting primarily of eosinophils. Chronic eosinophilic p\\nneumonia is usually associated with an increased number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood and patients respond promptly to treatment with steroids.\\nLow Attenuation pattern:\\nThe fourth pattern includes abnormalities that result in decreased lung attenuation or air-filled lesions. These include: Most diseases with a low attenuation pattern can be readily\\n distinguished on the basis of HRCT findings. Centrilobular emphysema due to smoking. The periphery of the lung is spared (blue arrows). Centrilobular artery (yellow arrows) is seen\\n in the center of the hypodense area.\\nEmphysema:\\nEmphysema typically presents as areas of low attenuation without visible walls as a result of parenchymal destruction. Paraseptal emphysema with small bullae Paraseptal emphysema Pa\\nraseptal emphysema is localized near fissures and pleura and is frequently associated with bullae formation (area of emphysema larger than 1 cm in diameter). Apical bullae may lead \\nto spontaneous pneumothorax. Giant bullae occasionally cause severe compression of adjacent lung tissue. Panlobular emphysema Panlobular emphysema On the left a typical case of panl\\nobular emphysema. There is uniform destruction of the underlying architecture of the secondary pulmonary lobules, leading to widespread areas of abnormally low attenuation. Pulmonar\\ny vessels in the affected lung appear fewer and smaller than normal. Panlobular emphysema is diffuse and is most severe in the lower lobes. In severe panlobular emphysema, the chara\\ncteristic appearance of extensive lung destruction and the associated paucity of vascular markings are easily distinguishable from normal lung parenchyma. On the other hand, mild an\\nd even moderately severe panlobular emphysema can be very subtle and difficult to detect on HRCT(1).\\nCystic lung disease:\\nLung cysts are defined as radiolucent areas with a wall thickness of less than 4mm. Cystic lung diseases as listed in the table on the left. Cavities are defined as radiolucent area\\ns with a wall thickness of more than 4mm and are seen in infection (TB, Staph, fungal, hydatid), septic emboli, squamous cell carcinoma and Wegener's disease. Langerhans cell histio\\ncytosis On the left a case with multiple round and bizarre shaped cysts. There was an upper lobe predominance. The patient had a long history of smoking. This combination of finding\\ns is typical for Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an idiopathic disease characterized in its early stages by granulomatous nodules containing La\\nngerhans histiocytes and eosinophils. In its later stages, the granulomas are replaced by fibrosis and the formation of cysts. It is an uncommon condition. The majority of patients \\nare young or middle-aged adults presenting with nonspecific symptoms of cough and dyspnea. Up to 20% of patients present with pneumothorax and over 90% of patients are smokers. Most\\n cysts appear round, but can also have bizarre shapes (bilobed or clover-leaf shaped). An upper lobe predominance in the size and number of cysts is common. Lymphangiomyomatosis com\\nplicated by pneumothorax On the left a case with multiple cysts that are evenly distributed througout the lung ( in contrast to LCH). Notice the pneumothorax. There was no history o\\nf smoking and this was a 40 year old female. This combination of findings is typical for Lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM).

Proliferation of these cells along the bronchioles leads to air trapping and the development of thin-walled lung cysts.\\n Rupture of these cysts can result in pneumothorax. Other features of LAM include adenopathy and pleural effusion. Lymphangiomyomatosis occurs only in women, usually of child-bearin\\ng age, between 17 and 50 years.\\nIdentical clinical, radiologic, and pathologic pulmonary changes are seen in about 1% of patients with tuberous sclerosis. Most patients die within 10 years of the onset of symptoms\\n. Bronchiectasis Bronchiectasis is defined as localized bronchial dilatation. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is usually based on a combination of the following findings: A signet-r\\ning sign represents an axial cut of a dilated bronchus (ring) with its accompanying small artery (signet). The most common cause of bronchiectasis is prior infection, usually viral,\\n at an early age. It also occurs in patients with chronic bronchitis, COPD and cystic fibrosis. Bronchiectasis may mimic cystic lung disease and bullous emphysema. Bronchiectasis ca\\nused by primary airway disease should be differentiated from tracion bronchiectasis as a result of fibrosis. ABPA: glove-finger shadow due to mucoid impaction in central bronchiecta\\nsis in a patient with asthma. On the left we see a chest film with a typical finger-in-glove shadow. The HRCT shows focal bronchiectasis with extensive mucoid impaction, which is in\\n the appropriate clinical setting (asthma and serum eosinophilia) typical for Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disea\\nse occurring in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis, triggered by a hypersensitivity reaction to the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus in the airways. It characteristically pres\\nents with the findings of central bronchiectasis, mucoid impaction and atelectasis.\\nDistribution within the lung:\\nUpper versus lower zone distribution:\\nUpper lung zone preference is mostly seen in inhalation diseases: Lower zone preference is seen in:\\nCentral versus peripheral distribution:\\nCentral distribution is seen in sarcoidosis, bronchitis and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Peripheral distribution is mainly seen in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), chronic eo\\nsinophilic pneumonia and UIP.\\nAdditional findings:\\nPleural effusion:\\nDiseases that manifest with pleural effusion are listed in the table.\\nLymphadenopathy:\\nIn sarcoidosis the common pattern is right paratracheal and bilateral hilar adenopathy ('1-2-3-sign').

We will focus on how mobile ultrasound can be used by health workers in regions where other modalities like mammogr\\naphy or MRI are not readily available. However this article is also a nice introduction for those who do mammography and MRI of the breast. The videos in the introduction cover most\\n of the material of the article.\\nIntroduction:\\nVideo 1:\\nIn this video we will discuss:\\nVideo 2:\\nIn this video we will discuss: Linear array transducer connected to smart phone US is mostly used in addition to mammography and MRI.\\nHowever it is an excellent primary tool to examine the breasts in symptomatic women who have a lump or localized pain in the breast. In most cases it can be decided whether we are d\\nealing with a benign condition or breast cancer.\\nIn some cases aspiration can help to differentiate complicated cyst from solid lesions and aspiration can be used to treat abscesses. Breast ultrasound is not usually done to screen\\n for breast cancer. This is because it is time consuming and you may miss some early signs of cancer like small not-palpable breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ which can pres\\nent as only small calcifications seen on a mammogram. That said, ultrasound is an extremely fast and powerful tool.\\nIt is safe, cheap and mobile and modern handheld-ultrasound machines consist of only a transducer connected to a mobile phone or tablet.\\nThese systems provide high resolution images for just over one thousand dollars. We expect that more doctors and health workers will use ultrasound in breastcare when no other modal\\nities like mammography or MRI are affordable or available.\\nThe connection to a mobile phone makes it easy to store images or to share them for a second opinion.\\nNormal Breast:\\nThe breast consists of a mixture of fibroglandular and fatty tissue. The glandular tissue is not evenly spread in the breast.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Focal collections of glandular tissue may present as a lump, because glandular tissue is more firm than the surrounding fatty tiss\\nue. In young women this is a very common cause of a often painful lump in the breast. When we place a transducer on the breast, the first layer that we see is the skin with undernea\\nth a mixture of glandular and fatty tissue. The deepest layer is the chest wall with the pectoral muscle, the ribs and the intercostal muscles. Posterior or deeper to the ribs no im\\naging is possible due to the absorption of the sound waves and this results in an artefact called posterior acoustic shadowing. This means that you cannot look beyond the ribs and t\\nhat posterior to the ribs, the image is black. The normal lungs are filled with air which also reflect ultrasound waves.\\nThe anterior border of the lung produces a hyperechoic or white line which moves as a result of normal breathing (see video below).

On this video normal breast anatomy. Notice the m\\novements of the lung during breathing. In this video a breast cancer is seen within the glandular tissue.\\nBreast composition:\\nWith ultrasound we can determine the composition of the breast: homogeneous fibroglandular - heterogeneous tissue - or homogeneous fat (fig).\\nNotice that the mammografic and ultrasound images are very much alike. In young women the breast mostly contains glandular tissue. This glandular tissue can be very pronounced durin\\ng pregnancy and lactation and can show cyclic changes in premenopausal women resulting in breasts that feel lumpy or painful. In older women the glandular tissue is gradually replac\\ned by fat, although some older women still may have a reasonable amount of glandular tissue. In adipose women there is more fat in the breasts even in younger women. Near the midlin\\ne the ribs are only composed of cartilage and are not calcified. The cartilage does not produce a white echo on the anterior side or posterior shadowing.\\nInstead a hypoechoic structure is seen anterior the the lungs. Do not mistake this structure for a breast tumor.\\nAt first glance this may look like a fibroadenoma when you image the rib on cross section.\\nBy turning the transducer you will notice that it is a long structure connected to the calcified part of the rib. The small subcutaneous lesion is a dermoid cyst, which we will disc\\nuss later. Within the same breast there may be areas with more fatty tissue and areas with mostly fibroglandular tissue as we can see on the video. When you look at the contour of t\\nhe glandular tissue (arrow), you can imagine, that this can feel bumpy on palpation and sometimes give the impression of a mass, when it is very pronounced. The way that the breasts\\n present on an ultrasound image may differ between machines of different manufacturers. This means that you have to get used to the images on your own ultrasound machine. The images\\n are of a Philips (left) and Siemens (right) ultrasound machine. Look for instance at the difference in the presentation of the skin.\\nUltrasound findings - overview:\\nBy far the most common abnormalities in the breast, which usually present as a lump in the breast are cysts, fibroadenomas, breast cancer and palpable glandular tissue. In the table\\n the typical ultrasound findings are listed (click to enlarge). We will discuss each of these findings in more detail in a moment. Cysts are seen in all age groups Fibro-adenomas ar\\ne benign tumors which are commonly seen in young women (especially 15-25 years) and seldom as a new finding in women over 50 years. Breast-cancer is seen predominantly in women over\\n 50 years of age and not that common in younger women. Palpable glandular tissue is seen in young women, in pregnancy and breast-feeding. \\nIt usually changes during the menstrual cycle.\\nCyst:\\nCysts are the most common lumps in the breast.\\nThey are fluid-filled sacs inside the breast and are always benign. It is extremely important to determine the cystic nature of a palpable lump, because then you can really reassure\\n the patient that everything is fine. On ultrasound the typical features of a cyst are: Posterior to a cyst, there is usually acoustic enhancement, also called posterior enhancement\\n, which refers to the increased echoes deep to the cyst, because fluid transmits sound very well. When the fluid is under tension, the cyst becomes more round and can be palpable. H\\nere a typical example of multiple cysts in a woman who felt a lump in her breast. Although there a many cysts, only the cyst in the center was palpable, because it was round with fl\\nuid under tension.\\nThe other cysts were not palpable, because they just felt like the surrounding normal breast tissue. It is very common to find more cysts in a woman who presents with a palpable cys\\nt. This woman had multiple small cysts in both breasts. These cysts were not palpable. Here a video of a palpable cyst. In this case the cyst was painful and it was decided to do a \\npuncture with aspiration of the fluid. Notice that the wall is a little bit thickened.\\nThis is frequently a sign of low grade infection and explains why the cyst was painful.\\nUncomplicated cysts are usually not painful. This is another infected cyst, which was aspirated. Aspiration is a quick and simple procedure.\\nIn most cases the fluid has a transparent yellow color, but it can be green or brown.\\nExamination of the aspirated fluid is not necessary.\\nComplicated cyst:\\nMost cysts have the typical appearance as shown above. Complicated cyst have an atypical appearance: A complicated cyst with a hypoechoic content usually contains low-level echoes, \\nthat move when the patient changes in position.\\nWhen there is still doubt whether a lesion is a cyst or a solid tumor, then puncture with aspiration can solve this problem. The image shows an echolucent, maybe somewhat hypoechoic\\n lesion with some irregularity of the wall, which is thickened.\\nThere is however posterior enhancement, which made us think, that this probably was a cyst.\\nA puncture was performed and the cyst was totally aspirated, which was the final proof.

The lesion number 6 was biopsied because of the age of the patient and turned out to be a fibroadenoma. Lesion number 7 was\\n biopsied because it had an irregular shape and looked like a carcinoma.\\nThis also turned out to be a fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas sometimes have calcifications but these are larger than the small calcifications that we encounter in carcinomas. Microcalci\\nfications as seen in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which can be a precursor of a carcinoma, are frequently not visible on ultrasound.\\nIn the detection of DCIS mammography has advantages.\\nBreast cancer:\\nBreast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women.\\nA woman's risk of getting breast cancer increases with age. Most women diagnosed with breast cancer are over the age of 50, but younger women can also get breast cancer. The first n\\noticeable clinical symptoms are: Here are some examples of breast cancer.

If you have this possibility on your ultrasound machine, you will notice that images produced with harmonic imaging have a higher r\\nesolution and are associated with fewer artifacts than conventional ultrasound imaging.\\nPosterior shadowing can be enhanced. Notice that the small breast cancer is better seen with harmonic imaging.\\nThere is a hypoechoic tumor with a hyperechoic halo and a little bit of posterior shadowing. The orientation is vertical.\\nThe border is indistinct and the shape of the tumor is irregular. This is a difficult and uncommon case. When you look at the image on the left a tumor is hardly seen.\\nIt almost looks like normal glandular tissue. However a mass was felt and when we look at the image with harmonics on, we can see the posterior shadowing. This turned out to be a br\\neast cancer.

In the table the differences in ultrasound appearances are listed. The a\\nge of the patient is another important issue, since fibroadenomas are commonly seen in young women especially 15-25 years and seldom in women over 50 years, while breast cancer is m\\nost commonly diagnosed in women over the age of 50 and is not common in younger women. In some cases it is not possible to make the distinction by ultrasound imaging alone and a bio\\npsy is needed for a final diagnosis.

At first glance they look not quite different.\\nStudy the images and determine the differences. The lesion on the left is a carcinoma. The lesion on the right is a fibroadenoma. Breast cancer: at first glance looks like a fibroad\\nenoma Age How does the age of a woman help us in the differentiation between a fibroadenoma and breast cancer? In most cases it confirms our imaging diagnosis.\\nOn the other hand when we see a mass in the breast in a younger woman that does not full-fill all the criteria of a typical fibroadenoma, we should do a biopsy to rule out a carcino\\nma.\\nFor instance because the lesion is not circumscribed or taller than wide. The same holds true for a new mass that looks like a fibroadenoma in an older woman. The image shows a lesi\\non, that at first glance looks like a fibroadenoma. \\nYet there are two things that don't fit.\\nFirst the age of the woman is 49 years and secondly on the posterior side the contour shows some irregularities.\\nA biopsy was performed and the mass proved to be a cancer.\\nPalpable glandular tissue:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Fibroglandular tissue is not evenly spread in the breast and is usually more pronounced in the upper lateral quadrant. Sometimes focal swelling of glandular tissue ca\\nn be very pronounced and causes a lump, that on palpation cannot be differentiated from a tumor. The ultrasound shows a collection of glandular tissue within a fatty breast.\\nSince the glandular tissue is more firm than the fatty tissue, this feels like a mass on palpation. A mammogram was performed with a marker on the palpable mass and also showed a fo\\ncal collection of normal glandular tissue. The video is of a woman who felt a lump in her breast. On ultrasound pronounced glandular tissue was found. Since the glandular tissue is \\nmore firm than the surrounding fatty tissue, you can imagine that when you glide with your finger over the skin, this area would feel like a bump. Fibroglandular tissue can be so pr\\nonounced that it is difficult for the ultrasound beam to pass through the tissue. This may give the impression of an irregular hypoechoic mass with posterior shadowing and simulate \\na carcinoma (video). However when you compress the tissue, you will see that it is just hyperechoic pronounced fibroglandular tissue. Usually these are young patients who present wi\\nth a large painful lump in their breast.\\nAbscess:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll A breast abscess is a painful build-up of pus in the breast caused by an infection. \\nIt mainly affects women who are breastfeeding as a complication of mastitis and is uncommon in non-breast feeding women. Women usually present with a painful lump and the skin can b\\ne red and thickened. The ultrasound is of a woman who presented with fever and a painful lump in the breast behind the retracted nipple.\\nDuring mild compression and decompression with the transducer it was noted that the fluid in the abscess was moving around.\\nNotice also the posterior enhancement which is another indication that the structure contains fluid. Continue with next image... Subsequently the abscess was apirated. Aspiration is\\n the first choice treatment of abscesses. No need for surgery or antibiotics in this case, although antibiotics are sometimes also given. Here another abscess located behind the nip\\nple, which was aspirated. This can be a painful procedure.\\nIt is best to inject local anesthesia in the skin and subcutis and to try to drain the pus through that same needle. If the pus is too thick, a thicker needle will do the job.\\nTake some time for the local anesthesia to work.\\nSkin and subcutis:\\nAbnormalities that originate in the skin or subcutis may present as a lump in the breast, but they do not represent breast abnormalities. When you can determine that a lesion origin\\nates in the skin or subcutis, you know that you are not dealing with a breast tumor. The ultrasound images show a lesion that is located in the skin and not within the breast. Most \\nof these lesions are dermoid cysts. \\nTry to find the connection to the skin, although this is not always visible. This woman presented with a painful lump in her breast and the skin was red. This is another intradermal\\n lesion.\\nNotice that the skin is thickened.

They are iso- or hyperechoic compared to the surrounding fat. They \\nare always benign. Sometimes a lipoma cannot be differentiated from fat necrosis, which we will discuss now.\\nFat necrosis:\\nFat necrosis is a benign entity frequently presenting as a superficially located palpable small mass within the breast. It is thought that fat necrosis is the result of trauma altho\\nugh the patient often does not recall a specific traumatic event. As a result of the trauma, the fatty tissue undergoes changes which make it more firm and sometimes tender on palpa\\ntion. On ultrasound it usually presents as a part of the fatty tissue that is mildly swollen and hyperechoic compared to the surrounding fatty tissue.\\nHence the similarity to a lipoma. The content may liquify and result in an oil cyst, which on ultrasound just looks like any other cyst. A lipoma is usually more soft and non-tender\\n.\\nRibs:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll A protruding rib can cause a hard swelling which may simulate a breast tumor.

By turning the transducer you can see that the rib is a longitud\\ninal structure anterior to the lung and posterior to the pectoral muscle..\\nAxilla:\\nNormal axillary lymph nodes are usually small oval shaped hypoechoic structures with a hyperechoic centre. The hyperechoic centre is mainly composed of fat and contains the vessels.\\n The surrounding hypoechoic cortex is the actual lymphogenic tissue. A normal intramammary lymph node Sometimes a lymph node only presents as an oval hypoechoic lesion without a vis\\nible hyperechoic center. When you see vessels in the hilus like in this case, then it definitely is a lymph node.\\nIn fact this lymph node was located within the breast, i.e. an intramammary lymph node, which is a benign finding. Large axillary lymph node metastases of a small irregular carcinom\\na\\nEnlarged lymph nodes:\\nEnlarged lymph nodes in the axilla can be the result of lymphogenic metastatic disease of breast cancer. The images are of a 50-year-old woman who presented with palpable masses in \\nthe axilla, that represented round enlarged hypoechoic lymph nodes. Subsequently there was an ultrasound examination of the breast, which revealed a small non-palpable hypoechoic ir\\nregular cancer.\\nEctopic glandular tissue in the axilla:\\nSome women have fibroglandular breast tissue in the axilla. This tissue behaves just like the glandular tissue in the breast and may get tense or painful at some time in the menstru\\nal cycle. The ultrasound image is of a young woman who felt a painful swelling in her axilla.\\nThe image shows normal glandular tissue in an atypical location.\\nBreast implants:\\nMost breast implants are silicone-filled prostheses.\\nOn ultrasound they look like a large cyst.\\nThe implant is most commonly placed posterior to the breast tissue or posterior to the pectoral muscle. Implants filled with silicone or saline are anechoic (echolucent). In most pa\\ntients, breast implants have a regular aspect with lobulated margins. Sometimes this lobulation can give the impression of a lump in the breast (figure). Collections or silicone lea\\nkage **\\nSilicone leakage:\\nWhen silicone leaks out of the implant it will cause a hyperechoic shadow or dirty shadow, just like we can see in the lungs caused by the air in the lungs. The image shows leakage \\nof silicone anterior to the prosthesis. Free silicone breast injections are an alternative form of breast augmentation to breast implants.\\nThey have serious adverse effects and are banned in many countries. The whole image looks blurred.\\nThis is called snow storm appearance. You will get the same image as when there is massive leakage. Here a fibroadenoma anterior to a silicone implant.\\nUltrasound in Men:\\nGynecomastia:\\nGynecomastia is the most common male breast disorder and commonly presents as a palpable lump or tenderness of the breast. Clinically, gynecomastia presents as a soft mobile tender \\nsubareolar mass. \\nAny mass that is not subareolar is not gynecomastia. On ultrasound the abnormality should be located right behind the nipple. Breast cancer in men just looks like breast cancer in w\\nomen. These images are of 70-year-old male who presented with a painfull swelling behind the right nipple.\\nNotice that there is some fibroglandular tissue on the right, while on the left there is only subcutaneous fat. Bilateral gynecomastia in an athlete taking steroids Newborns, boys g\\noing through puberty and older men may develop gynecomastia as a result of normal changes in hormone levels. A common cause of gynecomastia is the use of anabolic steroids  used by \\nathletes to build muscle and enhance performance. This patient had used steroids and has gynecomastia on both sides.\\nSometimes gynecomastia can result in images that simulate a carcinoma, like on the images here, but luckily the findings were on both sides and there was a history of steroid intake\\n. The diagnosis of gynaecomastia is usually easier to make on a mammogram.\\nNipple region:\\nThe region of the nipple can be difficult to examine. In most cases you see only some thickening of the skin and behind the nipple some dilated ducts. This image is of a patient who\\n presented with a retracted nipple. There is an irregular tumor behind the nipple with ingrowth into the nipple (arrow). Here another tumor behind the nipple (n). These tumors can b\\ne very difficult to detect. In every woman who complains of a retracted nipple this area should be examined carefully. This patient had a large nipple, which made it difficult to ex\\namine the region behind the nipple. A lot of gel (g) was used to get a good contact with the skin. A large tumor is seen behind the nipple.\\nCardiovascular devices:\\non Chest X-Ray:\\nFrederieke Elsinger, Robin Smithuis and Anje Spijkerboer\\nVancouver General Hospital in Canada, Alrijne hospital and the Amsterdam University Medical Center, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2018-12-01 The number of implanted cardiovascular devices has dramatically increased in recent years. With the advent of implantable cardioverterdefibrillators and c\\nardiac resynchronization therapy, devices have become more complex. There is also an increase of minimally invasive procedures to replace heart valves. An overview is presented of c\\nommon cardiovascular devices and procedures. Radiology plays an important role in the initial assessment and follow-up of these devices.\\nPacemakers:\\nThere are two types of cardiac conduction devices (CCD's): Pacemakers can have leads, that pace: The images show a pacemaker with an atrial and ventricular lead. The tip of the atri\\nal lead is pointed upward and anteriorly, because the ideal position is in the right atrial appendage, where it is anchored within the coarse trabeculae. The tip of the ventricular \\nlead is positioned in the apex of the right ventricle, which is located to the left of the spine on a frontal chest X-ray and anteriorly on a lateral view. Here an example of an ICD\\n with wires in the right atrial appendage, the apex of the right ventricle and a lead to the left ventricle in the posterior coronary vein. You can recognize the two shock coils of \\nthe ICD as thicker white bands along the course of the lead.\\nCardiac Resynchronization Therapy:\\nCardiac resynchronization therapy with a biventricular pacer is performed to synchronize the contraction of the right and left ventricle in patients with severe systolic heart failu\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='re and left or right bundle branch blocks or other intraventricular conduction defects. Here a biventricular pacemaker with three leads. The right atrial pacemaker lead is located i\\nn the atrial appendage. This lead first travels inferiorly into the right atrium and then turns upward and anteriorly where it is anchored within the trabeculae of the atrial append\\nage. The left ventricular lead travels through the right atrium and the sinus coronarius and is finally positioned posteriorly into a cardiac vein on the left.\\nEpicardial pacing leads:\\nEpicardial leads are frequently placed during cardiac surgery in order to allow cardiac pacing post-surgery. Some centers place them in all cardiac surgery patients, while others on\\nly in those who have rhythm disturbances intra-operatively. After a few days they can be removed by simple traction. Sometimes they are left in place. Retained epicardial wires do n\\not seem to present a hazard to patients in the MR environment. However, this conclusion applied mostly to non-cardiac MR examinations. First study the images. Then continue reading.\\n The findings are: Pacemakers can have various complications: The image is taken immediately after placement of an ICD. There is a small pneumothorax (arrow). This is the most commo\\nn complication.\\nAberrant lead position:\\nThis patient has a persistent left-sided superior vena cava (LVCS). This is a rare congenital anomaly that may be found at the time of cardiac device lead insertion. The persistent \\nLVCS communicates with the right atrium through the coronary sinus. The transvenous placement of cardiac device lead via persistent LSVC can be technically difficult and in some cas\\nes not possible.\\nLead fracture:\\nObvious fracture of one of the leads. Subtle lead fracture in malfunctioning pacemaker. Extremely subtle fracture line (arrow).\\nRetained leads:\\nHere a patient with an ICD with one lead and two shock coils. There is an retained lead still visible of an old pacemaker that was removed. Many patients have endocardial pacemaker \\nleads left in place after pulse generator removal. The safety of MR in patients with retained endocardial pacemaker wires has not been systematically investigated to date. However, \\ndue to the potential threat that they may act as \"antennas\" with significant heating - it is not recommended to scan those patients (reference).\\nTwiddler\\'s Syndrome:\\nTwiddler\\'s syndrome is a malfunction of a pacemaker due to the patient\\'s manipulation of the device and the subsequent dislodging of the leads. This results in malfunctioning of the\\n pacemaker or sometimes stimulation of other structures like phrenic nerve or brachial plexus. Here a patient with a normally placed ICD on the left image. Months later there was ma\\nlfunction due to ICD box and lead rotation (yellow arrow) and retraction (white arrow). Here another patient with the Twiddler\\'s syndrome. Notice curling of the lead near the pacema\\nker and at the tip in the right ventricle (arrows). Here another patient with Twiddler. There was malfunction of the pacemaker. A new pacemaker was inserted on the right side.\\nWiireless pacemaker device:\\nA Micra device is a small wireless pacemaker device, that is transfemorally implanted in the apex of the right ventricle. Close up view of the Micra device.\\nBrain stimulators:\\nParkinson brain stimulators have similar generators as cardiac pacemakers and are also placed in the subcutaneous chest. They should not be confused with pacemakers.\\nImplantable cardioverter-defibrillators:\\nImplantable cardioverter-defibrillators or ICD\\'s are devices that can recognize ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and terminate it by delivering an electrical shock. ICD\\'s ar\\ne implanted in patients with cardiomyopathy and a low left ventricular ejection fraction because they are at risk of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and sudden car\\ndiac death. This patient has a single coil ICD system (figure). The arrows point to the shock coil. Continue with next images. This patient has three leads: Here another patient wit\\nh an ICD with only one lead and one shock coil. Here an ICD with one lead and two shock coils.\\nSubcutaneous ICD:\\nThe S-ICD or subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is not connected to the heart or the vessels. A presternal wire is placed and connected to a laterally placed ICD wi\\nth the heart located between the wire and the box. This system is not capable of pacing the heart.\\nLoop recorders:\\nLoop recorders are implantable cardiac monitors to continuously record the cardiac rhythm in patients with unexplained palpitations or syncope. They are placed subcutaneously. These\\n devices are getting smaller and smaller and should not be mistaken for an USB flashdrive. Loop recorders have a variety of uses including monitoring patients with unexplained synco\\npal episodes and assessment of patients with atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, or conduction disturbances. These recorders can provide more than a year of monitoring tha\\nt may be activated by the patient or be automatically activated. Another example of a loop recorder.\\nValve replacement and repair:\\nThis is an illustration of the heart valves in the coronal plane. The heart valves are best determined on a lateral radiograph. The aortic and pulmonary valves are above a line draw\\nn from the apex to the base of the heart, while the mitral and tricuspid valves are below that line Here we see the normal valve position on an PA and lateral chest X-ray. On the la\\nteral chest film the aortic and pulmonary valves are located above the line from base of the heart to the apex and tricuspid and mitral valves are below this line. Different types o\\nf valves: These are from synthetic material. These patients are on anticoagulant therapy.\\n* Biological or bioprosthetic valves These are made from animal valves. No anticoagulation therapy needed\\nMechanical valves:\\nThe images show some examples of mechanical heart valves. These are manufactured mechanical valves. They last for about 20 years. Patients require anticoagulantia and therefore thei\\nr use is decreasing. The St. Jude bi-leaflet mechanical valve is most commonly used and has a radiopaque peripheral ring.\\nBioprosthetic valves:\\nHere some examples of prostetic heart valves. The main limitation of bioprosthetic valves is their limited durability, which exposes the patient to the risk of valve reintervention.\\n Last about 10-15 years but do not require anticoagulation. Typically chosen for older patients, those with a contraindication to anticoagulation or for lower velocity inflow valves\\n (mitral and tricuspid). Aortic valve prosthesis in good position\\nTricuspid valves:\\nTricuspid stenosis is the result of rheumatic heart disease and is treated with valve replacement. Tricuspid regurgitation is the result of right ventricular dilatation and is treat\\ned with annuloplasty. This patient has three valves repaired: There is a pacemaker with epicardial leads. This was done, because it was thought that a normally placed lead to the ri\\nght ventricle would interfere too much with the function of the tricuspid valve prosthesis. White arrow points to aortic valve. Yellow arrow points to mitral valve.\\nTAVR:\\nTAVR is a transcatheter aortic valve repair. The stenotic aortic valve is repaired by placing a prosthetic valve within the diseased valve. TAVR is for patients who have a high risk\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

TAVR is associated with higher rates of vascular injury, paravalvular regurgitation and the need for permanent pacemaker \\nplacement.\\nPulmonary valves:\\nThe Melody valve is a transcatheter pulmonary valve (TPV). It is a bovine jugular vein sewn within a platinum-iridium stent. The Melody valve is inserted through a catheter percutan\\neously. This Melody stent has multiple fractures (yellow arrows)\\nMitraClip:\\nIn patients with severe mitral regurgitation and who are not a candidate for open heart surgery, a transcatheter mitral valve repair, known as the MitraClip, is an appropriate thera\\npy. The centre of the mitral leaflets are approximated by the Mitraclip to reduce the regurgitation while still leaving enough room for passage of blood from the left atrium to the \\nleft ventricle (figure). Here a patient with three different valves: aortic, mitral and tricuspid. Aortic valve replacement. This patient has a Medtronic Hancock mitral valve replac\\nement and an annuloplasty of the tricuspid valve.\\nClosure devices:\\nAtrial Septal defect:\\nClosure devices are used in patients with ASD and signs of right ventricle overload which can lead to heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Closure devices are often self-adjusting\\n and lie flat against the atrial or ventricular septum. This flat design helps create a natural profile. Here a lateral view of a child with an ASD and an Amplatz closure device. A \\nlateral view of a child with an ASD and an Umbrella Rashkind closure device. Images of a patient with an ASD and an Amplatz closure device. Here a patient with a larger defect, that\\n was closed with two devices. Continue with the CT-images. Transverse CT-image and coronal reconstruction of the same patient. This patient has three closure devices. Dislocation of\\n the closure device. CT demonstrates, that the Amplatz device is dislocated into the aortic arch. First look at the images. Then continue reading. This is an Amplatz cardiac plug to\\n close the left atrial appendage. This is an alternative to oral anticoagulation for prevention of thromboembolic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation\\nWatchman:\\nA commonly used left atrial appendage closure device is the Watchman implant. It is a preventive measure for stroke caused by clots originating from the heart in patients with atria\\nl fibrillation for which anticoagulants are contraindicated.\\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus:\\nA patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a persistent communication between the descending thoracic aorta and the pulmonary artery that results from failure of normal physiologic closure\\n of the fetal ductus. During the first 60 hours of life, spontaneous closure of the ductus occurs in 55% of full-term newborn infants. By 2-6 months of age, closure occurs in more t\\nhan 95% of healthy infants. Large PDA in older children and adults can lead to pulmonary hypertension and chronic heart failure as a result of a left-to-right shunt. These are image\\ns of a patient with a persistent ductus arteriosus. The ductus was closed with an Amplatz plug device.\\nScimitar vein plugging:\\nScimitar syndrome is characterized by partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, in which an abnormal right pulmonary vein drains into the inferior vena cava. Correction is indicate\\nd in adults with signs of pulmonary volume overload or right heart dilation. Images: Scimitar vein pre- end post plugging.\\nVascular Stents:\\nCoarctation:\\nIntravascular stent therapy is considered a primary therapeutic option for most adults and adolescents with coarctation of the aorta (refence). Image: intravascular stent in good po\\nsition. Continue... MRA-image of the same patient pre-stenting. CTA-image post-stenting. Image: dislocated stent. ..\\nTEVAR:\\nThoracic EndoVascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) is a procedure that involves placement of a covered stent in the aorta in patients with a symptomatic thoracic aneurysm. The stent graft \\nis delivered in a collapsed state through a catheter, that is most often inserted into the femoral artery and positioned using X-ray guidance. The stent graft is then expanded to sp\\nan and cover the site of aortic injury (reference).\\nCoronary stents:\\nX-rays show a stent projecting over the anterior ventricle wall, where the LAD is located. First look at the images. Then continue reading. Where are the stents positioned? The coro\\nnary stents are positioned in the right coronary artery (yellow arrow) and the left anterior descending artery (white arrow). First look at the images. Then continue reading. Where \\nare the stents positioned? The coronary stents are positioned in the left circumflex artery (yellow arrow) and the left anterior descending artery (white arrow).\\nLeft ventricular assist device:\\nA left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a surgically implanted device that takes over ventricular pump function in patients with severely impaired ejection fraction. They were in\\nitially implanted as a bridge to cardiac transplant or during myocardial recovery, but are now also used in patients not suitable for transplant. Here we see a patient with a LVAD. \\nThe outflow cannula is inserted in the apex and the radiolucent outflow cannula is connected to the ascending aorta. Also note the triple lead, double shock coil ICD and previous LI\\nMA graft clips.\\nImpella:\\nAn Impella is a small, temporary heart pump, attached to a transfemoral (or axillary) catheter. \\nIt is intended for short term use (from 6 hours to < 14 days, depending on the type) during high risk PCI or in patients recovering from AMI cardiogenic shock. The Impella’s inlet i\\ns placed in the left ventricle, where blood is apirated and delivered to the outlet which is situated in the ascending aorta. The Chest X-Ray shows correct placement of impella with\\n inlet (yellow arrow) and outlet (white arrow) in the left ventricle and acsending aorta.

It consis\\nts of a cylindrical polyurethane balloon that sits in the aorta, approximately 2 centimeters (0.79 in) from the left subclavian artery. The balloon inflates and deflates via counter\\n pulsation, meaning it actively deflates in systoleand inflates in diastole. Systolic deflation decreases afterload through a vacuum effect and indirectly increases forward flow fro\\nm the heart. Diastolic inflation increases blood flow to the coronary arteries via retrograde flow. These actions combine to decrease myocardial oxygen demand and increase myocardia\\nl oxygen supply (reference).\\nVascular surgery clips - CABG:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

The catheter should be passed through the umbilic artery and enter the aorta via the internal iliac artery. It should demonstrate the typical loop from the\\n umbilicus inferiorly into the internal iliac artery. In order to avoid placement into aortic branches, the catheter should be either in a high position above the celiac, mesenteric\\n and renal arteries or in a low position below the inferior mesenteric artery: The high position is advisable since it leads to less vascular complications (15).

Then through the ductus venosus into a hepatic vein and the inferior caval vein (IVC). The\\n tip should be positioned in the IVC at the level of the diaphragm. Several line malpositions are possible: Not all medication can be administered through a line in this position.\\n* Intrahepatic into the portal venous system, both right and left, or even into the superior mesenteric or splenic vein. This can cause thrombosis.\\n* Perforation of the portal vein can cause haemorrhage or abscess formation in the liver.\\n* Position too deep in right atrium or in the left atrium through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect.

There are numerous interstitial lung disease\\ns, but in clinical practice only about ten diseases account for approximately 90% of cases. Knowledge of both radiological and clinical appearances of these more common interstitial\\n lung diseases is therefore important for recognizing them in daily practice and including them in the differential diagnosis. Some less common interstitial lung diseases will also \\nbe presented because their HRCT presentation may be very typical, allowing for a 'spot diagnosis' in selected cases. In 'HRCT - basic interpretation' the terminology is introduced a\\nnd a practical approach is given for the interpretation of HRCT examinations.\\nIntroduction:\\nMore than 100 entities manifest as diffuse lung disease. Fortunately only about 10 of these account for about 90% of all diffuse lung diseases, that are assessed by open lung biopsy\\n. Knowing the common and also uncommon HRCT-presentations of these frequently encountered diffuse lung diseases is extremely important. On the left you find three different lists of\\n diagnoses. Accounting for 80 - 90% of all diagnoses according to various literature references. In some of them the old names are used and in some the newer ones. The 'mnemonic' fo\\nr the first list is 'SHIT FACED' (alternative shaded fit).\\nSarcoidosis:\\nSarcoidosis is a systemic disorder of unknown origin. It is characterized by non-caseating granulomas in multiple organs, that may resolve spontaneously or progress to fibrosis. Pul\\nmonary manifestations are present in 90% of patients. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats and weight loss are common. Loefgren's syndrome, an acute presentation of sarco\\nidosis, consists of arthritis, erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar adenopathy and occurs in 9-34% of patients. Erythema nodosum is seen predominantly in women and arthritis is more co\\nmmon in men. Two third of patients have a remission within ten years. One third have continuing disease leading to clinically significant organ impairment. Less than 5% of patients \\ndie from sarcoidosis usually as a result of pulmonary fibrosis. Sarcoidosis stage I: left and right hilar and paratracheal adenopathy (1-2-3 sign) Stages Chest films in sarcoidosis \\nhave been classified into four stages: These stages do not indicate disease chronicity or correlate with changes in pulmonary function. Images\\nA patient with stage I disease. There is hilar and paratracheal adenopathy and no sign of pulmonary involvement.

Image\\nA detailed view with the typical HRCT-presentation with nodules along bronchovascular bundle (red arrow) and fissures (yellow arrow). This is the typical perilymphatic distribution \\nof the nodules. Sarcoidosis: typical presentation The HRCT appearance of pulmonary sarcoidosis varies greatly and is known to mimic many other diffuse infiltrative lung diseases. Ap\\nproximately 60 to 70% of patients with sarcoidosis have characteristic radiologic findings. In 25 to 30% of cases the radiologic findings are atypical. In 5 to 10% of patients the c\\nhest radiograph is normal. On the left another typical presentation of sarcoidosis with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and small nodules in a perilymphatic distribution along bronchova\\nscular bundles and along fissures (yellow arrows). Always look for small nodules along the fissures, because this is a very specific and typical sign of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis wit\\nh conglomerate masses of fibrous tissue Fibrosis in Sarcoidosis. Progressive fibrosis in sarcoidosis may lead to peribronchovascular (perihilar) conglomerate masses of fibrous tissu\\ne. The typical location is posteriorly in the upper lobes, leading to volume loss of the upper lobes with displacement of the interlobar fissure. Other diseases that commonly result\\n in this appearance are: Sarcoidosis with fibrosis in the upper lobes. Typical chest film. Here a typical chest film of long standing sarcoidosis (stage IV) with fibrosis in the upp\\ner zones and volume loss of the upper lobes resulting in hilar elevation. Fibrosis results in obliteration of pulmonary vessels, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension. Sarcoidosi\\ns with fibrosis in the upper lobes. Typical HRCT findings. Here another case of stage IV sarcoidosis. Notice the distribution of the conglomerate masses of fibrosis in the posterior\\n part of the lungs. In addition there are multiple small well-defined nodules. Some of these nodules have the typical subpleural distribution.

This case nicely demonstrates that sarcoidosis truely is 'the great mimicker'. Sarcoidosis should be therefore\\n in our differential diagnostic list!. On the left a case of fibrosing sarcoidosis, showing fibrosis, traction bronchiectases and crowding of the involved bronchi, predominantly in \\nthe perihilar region and upper lobes. Nodular abnormalities are absent, but the appearance and the location of the fibrosis are very suggestive of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Diff\\nerential diagnosis of Sarcoidosis. On the left some diseases with a nodular pattern.\\nSilicosis / Coal worker pneumoconiosis:\\nSilicosis and Coal worker pneumoconiosis (CWP) are pathologically distinct entities with differing histology, resulting from the inhalation of different inorganic dusts. The radiogr\\naphic and HRCT appearances of these diseases, however, may not be distinguishable from each other and may be similar to sarcoidosis. It is important to realize that these diseases a\\nre rare compared to sarcoidosis. Silicosis and CWP occur in a specific patient group (construction workers, mining workers, workers exposed to sandblasting, glass blowing and potter\\ny). HRCT findings in Silicosis/CWP On the left a case of silicosis showing nodules of varying sizes with a random and subpleural distribution.\\nOne nodule contains calcification (arrow).\\nNote the absence of a lymphatic distribution pattern (peribronchovascular and along fissures), which would be suggestive of sarcoidosis. Same patient with silicosis as previous imag\\nes showing a conglomerate mass in a perihilar location in the right upper lobe. The left lobe shows multiple nodules of varying size. Differential diagnosis of Silicosis / Pneumocon\\niosis.\\nLymphangitic Carcinomatosis:\\nLymphangitic Carcinomatosis results from hematogenous spread to the lung, with subsequent invasion of interstitium and lymphatics. The presenting symptoms are dyspnea and cough and \\ncan predate the radiographic abnormalities. In many cases however the patients are asymptomatic. Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis is seen in carcinoma of the lung, breast, stomach, pancr\\neas, prostate, cervix, thyroid and metastatic adenocarcinoma from an unknown primary. HRCT findings in Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis Image\\nA patient with Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis. Notice the focal distribution. This finding is helpful in distinguishing Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis from other causes of interlobular se\\nptal thickening like pulmonary edema or sarcoid. There is also lymphadenopathy.

Examples o\\nf  Lymphangitic carcinomatosis and differential diagnosis\\nCardiogenic pulmonary edema:\\nPatients with pulmonary edema are not imaged with HRCT as their diagnosis is usually based on a combination of clinical and chest radiographic findings. However sometimes the diagno\\nsis is not that straightforward and knowledge of the HRCT appearance of pulmonary edema can be helpful in avoiding misdiagnosis. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema HRCT findings in cardiog\\nenic pulmonary edema On the left typical features of cardiogenic pulmonary edema There is smooth septal thickening and some ground glass opacity in the dependent part of the lungs. \\nIn addition there is bilateral pleural fluid. In a patient with a known malignancy lymphangitic carcinomatosis would be high in the differential diagnostic list. Cardiogenic pulmona\\nry edema Differential diagnosis of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. On the left another example of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This patient had a CT to rule out pulmonary emboli. There\\n is smooth septal thickening and ground glass opacity in a more patchy distribution. Note: edema can have a very unusual appearance and be distributed very patchy: some areas are fi\\nlled with fluid as opposed to other areas in immediate vicinity which appear normal.\\nHypersensitivity Pneumonitis:\\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA). HP is an allergic lung disease caused by the inhalation of a variety of antigens (farmer's lu\\nng, bird fancier's lung, 'hot tub' lung, humidifier lung). The radiographic and pathologic abnormalities in patients can be classified into acute, subacute, and chronic stages. Most\\nly HRCT is performed in the subacute stage of HP, weeks to months following the first exposure to the antigen or in the chronic phase. Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis with ill\\n-defined centrilobular nodules Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis The key findings in the subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis are: Here two examples of subacute hypersensitivit\\ny pneumonitis. There are ill-defined centrilobular nodules of ground-glass opacity. Here another case of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. There is subtle opacity in the centre\\n of the secondary lobules (arrows) with sparing of the subpleural region. This HRCT-image also demonstrates subtle centrilobular opacity in a patient with subacute HP. Notice how il\\nl-defined these centrilobular nodules are. Sometimes the centrilobular opacities are more nodular in appearance as in this case. Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis with mosaic pa\\nttern Here another case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. There is a mosaic pattern. Some secundary lobules demonstrate ground-glass opacity due to lung infiltration, while others ar\\ne more lucent due to bronchiolitis with air trapping. LEFT: HRCT at presentation. RIGHT: HRCT ten days later This patient presented with acute dyspnoe and a normal chest film (not s\\nhown). The HRCT at presentation (left) shows lobular areas of ground glass attenuation. A control HRCT ten days later (right) demonstrated, that the findings had resolved without an\\ny treatment. The findings were thought to be due to hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Nonspecific chest film, typical HRCT-findings. Chronic hypers\\nensitivity pneumonitis The key findings in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis are: On the left a patient with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The HRCT shows a mosaic pattern\\n with hyperaerated secondary nodules and secondry nodules of increased attenuation. Additionally there is septal and intralobular reticular thickening, indicating already existing i\\nrreversible fibrosis. UIP with honeycombing (left) and chronic HP (right) Differential diagnosis of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis. Chronic stage: UIP has a strong lower zone distribu\\ntion. In chronic HP fibrotic changes are typically seen throughout the whole lung parenchyma from the periphery towards the centrum. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Chronic hy\\npersensitivity pneumonitis (2) The case on the left shows an inspiratory and expiratory scan: the mosaic pattern with areas of ground-glass attenuation and areas of low attenuation,\\n that become more evident on the expiratory scan, indicating air trapping. Signs of fibrosis such as distorted vessels and bronchi as well as septal thickening are more pronounced i\\nn the mid and lower lung zones, but not limited to the subpleural area. The images on the left suggest the diagnosis hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Based on the imaging findigs alone\\n, alveolar proteinosis and other diseases with a mozaic pattern should be included in the differential diagnosis.\\nTuberculosis:\\nPrimary TB:\\nInitial infection with consolidation, adenopathy and pleural effusion.\\nSecondary TB  :\\nPost-primary or reactivation TB.

The HRCT demonstrates multiple nodules in peribronchial distribution, partially confluent, and a cavitation in the right lung, strongly suggestive for \\ntuberculosis. Other diseases in the differential are Wegener granulomatosis or malignancy (both show no tree-in-bud). Endobronchial spread of TB with tree-in-bud Endobronchial sprea\\nd of TB This can occur with primary or postprimary infection. In most subjects, the primary infection is localized and clinically inapparent. However, in 5 to 10% of patients with p\\nrimary TB, the infection is poorly contained and dissemination occurs. This is termed progressive primary tuberculosis. Extensive cavitation of the tuberculous pneumonia lead to end\\nobronchial spread of the infection. Rupture of necrotic lymph nodes into the bronchi can also result in endobronchial dissemination. Tree-in-bud appearance is typical for active end\\nobronchial spread of infection. It occurs in acute tuberculosis but also in any other bacterial infection. LEFT: miliary TB. RIGHT: metastases Differential diagnosis of TB.

ARDS represents the result of increased permeability often in\\n combination with injury to the respiratory epithelium. A variety of underlying conditions, from infections to major trauma, can cause ARDS. Primary pulmonary risk factors include a\\nspiration, pneumonia, toxic inhalation and pulmonary contusion. \\nExtrapulmonary  risk factors are sepsis, pancreatitis, multiple blood transfusions, trauma and the use of drugs such as heroin. Mild forms of ARDS may resolve completely, while seve\\nre forms result in irreverible fibrosis. Why some people develop ARDS and others do not is unknown. Extra-pulmonary ARDS with gravity dependent gradient Extra-pulmonary ARDS On the \\nleft a patient who was involved in a traffic accident and within hours developed ARDS. The dominant pattern is ground glass opacity. In the dependent parts of the lung there is also\\n some consolidation, so there is a gradient from front to back. An important finding in extra-pulmonary ARDS is the symmetry of the abnormalities. Pulmonary ARDS with asymmetric pat\\nchy distribution of consolidations. Pulmonary ARDS On the left a patient who developed ARSD as a result of pneumonia (i.e. pulmonary ARDS). Note the patchy distribution of lung dise\\nase and the almost complete distorsion more basal. Patient is ventilated with PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure ) leading to a barotrauma of the lung parenchyma: there are mult\\niple subpleural cysts and a bilateral pneumothorax. LEFT: ARDS. RIGHT: Fibrosis in the anterior parts as a result of damage related to barotraumas and PEEP ventilation Consolidation\\ns have a protecting effect on the lung parenchyma under PEEP ventilation, while the ventrally located areas of more normal lung are most prone to the effects of barotrauma. As a res\\nult we find cystic destruction ventrally and residual fibrosis mostly in the ventral lung areas.\\nIdiopathic interstitial pneumonias:\\nThe idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) comprise a heterogenous group of disorders. They represent fundamental responses of the lung to injury and do not represent 'diseases' \\nper se. Idiopathic indicates unknown cause and interstitial pneumonia refers to involvement of the lung parenchyma by varying combinations of fibrosis and inflammation. IIPs include\\n seven entities listed in the table on the left in order of relative frequency. These diseases have specific patterns of morphologic findings on HRCT and histology. Before we call t\\nhese findings idiopathic or cryptogenic, we should realise, that these patterns are also common findings in collagen vascular diseases (e.g., sclerodermia, rheumatoid arthritis) and\\n drug-related lung diseases. For instance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis findings of NSIP, UIP, OP and LIP have been reported.\\nUIP:\\nUsual Interstitial Pneumonitis (UIP) is a histologic diagnosis. UIP has distinctive HRCT findings and is usually shown at lungbiopsy, when honeycombing is visible.\\nIf the UIP pattern is of unknown cause (i.e. idiopathic), the disease is called Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF accounts for more than 60% of the cases of UIP. In the prese\\nnce of a surgical biopsy showing a UIP pattern the diagnosis of IPF requires exclusion of other known causes of UIP including drug toxicities, environmental exposures (asbest), and \\ncollagen vascular diseases like RA, SLE, polyarteritis nodosa and sclerodermia. A long list of drugs have been implicated, but this pattern is most commonly the result of cytotoxic \\nchemotherapeutic agents such as bleomycin, busulfan, vincristine, methotrexate, adriamycin, and carmustine (BCNU). The differentiation between NSIP and UIP has tremendous prognostic\\n implication for the patient. UIP is more progressive and more than 50% of patients with UIP die within 3 years. Chest film in a patient with UIP demonstrating the reticular pattern\\n in basal and subpleural distribution due to honeycombing. On the left a chest film of a patient with UIP due to IPF.

NSIP is histologically characterized by a homogeneous, uniform pattern of cellular inter\\nstitial inflammation associated with variable degrees of fibrosis. In contrast, UIP is associated with extensive fibrosis which is temporally inhomogeneous (i.e. various lesions are\\n of different ages). NSIP is a very inhomogeneous group. NSIP ranges from type I which is a cellular pattern seen as ground glass opacity on HRCT to type IV with a fibrotic pattern,\\n which may be indistinguishable from UIP.

For the pathologist th\\ne key feature is the uniformity of the abnormality within the lung. The role of the radiologist is more to 'exclude UIP pattern' rather than to make the diagnosis of NSIP. The diagn\\nosis of NSIP requires histological proof. In all patients with a NSIP pattern, the clinician should be advised to look for connective tissue diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis o\\nr drugs . On the left two cases of NSIP. Note the varying combination of GGO and fibrosis (traction bronchiectasis), but the lack of honeycombing. NSIP (3) NSIP is the prevalent lun\\ng pattern in systemic sclerosis and polymyosisits/dermatomyositis (more than 90%), but also may occur in RA, SLE, Sj?gren's and MCTD. In the images on your left you can appreciate a\\ngain the spectrum of findings seen in NSIP. All three patients were suffering from connective tissue disease, all cases were biopsy proven. The first (top left) shows a very subtle \\nGGO. Note the difference in the density of the air within the bronchus and surrounding lungparenchyma (dark bronchus sign). The second (top right) is a more obvious example of GGO w\\nith a superimposed fine reticular densities as a result of thickening of the intralobular septa. The last image also shows GGO with a fine reticular pattern. Notice the lack of hone\\nycombing in all three cases, excluding UIP as diagnosis. NSIP (4) The HRCT of this patient with scleroderma and NSIP shows a fine subpleural reticular pattern in the upper lobes and\\n more extensive abnormalities in the lower lung zones. There are also areas of ground-glass and traction bronchiectases, but honeycombing is typically lacking. Note also the mildly \\ndilated esophagus, which is consistent with scleroderma.\\nCOP:\\nCryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) used to be described as bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) in an earlier version of the classification of idiopathic in\\nterstitial pneumonias. It is a inflammatory process in which the healing process is characterized by organization of the exudate rather than by resorption ('unresolved pneumonia'). \\nOrganizing pneumonia is mostly idiopathic and then called cryptogenic, but is also seen in patients with pulmonary infection, drug reactions, collagen vascular disease, Wegener's gr\\nanulomatosis and after toxic-fume inhalation. OP presents with a several-month history of nonproductive cough, low-grade fever, malaise and shortness of breath. There is a good resp\\nonse to corticosteroid therapy and a good prognosis. OP is again a great mimicker and can show a broad variety of HRCT findings, which makes it a frequent differential diagnosis and\\n actually represents a diagnosis of exclusion. Frequently biopsy is needed for final proof. HRCT findings in OP On the left a patient with the typical bilateral peripheral consolida\\ntions of OP. After exclusion of other diseases such as lymphoma, infection, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, the diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia was made. OP in a patient wi\\nth collagen vascular disease On the left a patient who complained of arthritic pain. There are multiple small bilateral peripheral consolidations. The findings in this patient are n\\not as specific as in the former case, but this was also organizing pneumonia, but now related to collagen vascular disease. OP in rheumatoid arthritis On the left a patient with rhe\\numatoid arthritis and bilateral peripheral consolidations as a result of organizing pneumonia. Patients with OP associated with collagen vascular diseases respond less well to thera\\npy with steroids. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (left) versus Organizing pneumonia (right) Differential diagnosis of Organizing Pneumonia. The images on the left show the similarit\\nies between chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and organizing pneumonia. Differentiation has to be made on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings.\\nRB-ILD and DIP:\\nRespiratory bronchiolitis (RB), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), and desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) represent different degrees of\\n severity of small airway and parenchymal reaction to cigarette smoke (8). All smokers have various degrees of respiratory bronchiolitis, but it is usually asymptomatic. However 5-1\\n0% of smokers have a clinically significant lung disease in association with RB, presenting with symptoms, lung function tests and auscultatory findings at clinical examination. The\\n term RB-ILD was proposed to describe the bronchocentric (or centrilobular) lung disease in these patients and the term DIP was used to describe the more diffuse disorder. Radiologi\\ncally however these diseases cannot be clearly separated because of the overlap of CT findings. HRCT findings in RB-ILD On the left a patient with RB-ILD. The dominant feature is gr\\nound glass opacification and there are some thickened interlobular septa (arrow). Usually these patients will also have smoking induced centrilobular emphysema and there is some evi\\ndence that respiratory bronchiolitis is the precursor of emphysema. RB-ILD (2) On the left a smoker with RB-ILD with subtle HRCT-findings. The dominant pattern is ground glass opaci\\nfication. Additional findings in this patient are paraseptal emphysema in the upper lobes and some subtle septal thickening in the basal parts. Based on these non-specific CT findin\\ngs there is a broad differential diagnosis and additional clinical information is mandatory for the interpretion of the HRCT. Since this patient is a smoker we first think RB-ILD. I\\nn a immunocompromised patient PCP would be on top of the list. If this patient was coughing up blood, this probably would be pulmonary hemorrhage (although we would expect more pulm\\nonary densities in these patients). If this patient was a bird-fancier we would first think hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but mostly these patients do not smoke. LEFT: RB-ILD in smo\\nker. RIGHT: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in non-smoker On the left two different patients with similarl HRCT findings. The left one is a smoker with RB-ILD and the patient on the ri\\nght has hypersensitivity pneumonits.\\nNote the difference in severity of ground glass opacities and the well defined areas of airtrapping in HP. Somehow smoking seems to protect against HP. This is not a 100% specific c\\nriterium but is quite helpful for differential diagnosis. RB-ILD (3) On the left a patient with DIP. The HRCT shows diffuse areas of ground-glass density in the lower lobes and some\\n mosaic pattern as the sole abnormality. Reticular abnormalities and signs of fibrosis are typically absent. These abnormalities are usually reversible and will disappear upon cessa\\ntion of smoking. AIP\\nAIP:\\nAcute interstitial pneumonia (AIP, earlier named Hamman Rich Pneumonitis) is a rare idiopathic lung disease characterized by diffuse alveolar damage with subsequent fibrosis. It has\\n a fatal outcome in many cases. The histologic pattern aswell as the HRCT findings in AIP are indistinguishable from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The HRCT characteris\\ntics are diffuse or patchy consolidation, often with a crazy paving appearance like in the case on the left. There are areas of consolidation and extensive areas of ground-glass den\\nsity with a crazy-paving appearance.\\n These abnormalities developed in several days and this rapid progression of disease combined with these imaging findings are very suggestive of the diagnosis AIP.\\nLIP:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

Lymphangiomyomatos\\nis, LIP and Langerhans cell histiocytosis On the left three different patients with lung cysts. From left to right: Lymphangiomyomatosis, LIP and Langerhans cell histiocytosis.\\nDrug-induced lung disease:\\nDrug-induced lung disease is a major source of iatrogenic lung injury. The major diagnostic problem is, that it may present with a large variety of radiologic patterns. It may prese\\nnt as organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or even as ARDS. The diagnosis of drug-induced pulmonary disease is usually one of exclusi\\non. Drug-induced interstitial lung fibrosis On the left a patient who is treated with cytotoxic drugs for a hematologic malignancy. The radiographic findings are areas of ground gla\\nss opacity, some traction bronchiectasis and subtle honeycombing in the left lower lobe. This could be the result of an idiopathic form of fibrosis like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosi\\ns and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis or fibrosis in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and longstanding sarcoid. However it is not one of the typical forms of fibrosis, tha\\nt we commonly encounter in patients with a UIP pattern or NSIP pattern seen in collagenvascular diseases. When there is fibrosis, that does not fit into any of the common diseases w\\nith fibrosis always consider drug-related lung disease in the differential. Drug-induced organizing pneumonia Drug-induced organizing pneumonia is commonly caused by Bleomycin and C\\nyclophosphamide and other drugs like Methotrexate, Amiodarone, Nitrofurantoin and Penicillamine (9). The HRCT findings are the same as in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Drug-indu\\nced non-specific interstitial pneumonita (NSIP) occurs most commonly as a manifestation of carmustine toxicity or of toxicity from noncytotoxic drugs such as amiodarone. The radiolo\\ngic findings are the same as in other forms of NSIP.\\nUncommon interstitial lung diseases:\\nLymphangiomyomatosis:\\nClinical findings: Key findings in Lymphangiomyomatosis: On the left a typical case of LAM with multiple evenly spread thin walled cysts complicated by a pneumothorax. . Differentia\\nl diagnosis of Lymphangiomyomatosis: On the left another typical case of LAM.\\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis:\\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis is also known as pulmonary histiocytosis X or eosinophilic granuloma. LCH is probably an allergic reaction to cigarette smoke since more than 90% of pa\\ntients are active smokers. In the early nodular stage it is characterized by a centrilobular granulomatous reaction by Langerhans histiocytes. In the cystic stage bronchiolar oblite\\nration causes alveolar wall fibrosis and cyst formation. Early stage Langerhans cell histiocytosis with small nodules HRCT findings in Langerhans cell histiocytosis: On the left ear\\nly stage Langerhans cell histiocytosis with small nodules. There are no cysts visible. Late stage Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. Cysts progress to typical bizarre shaped cysts. In \\na later stage the nodules start to cavitate and become cysts. These cysts start as round structures but finally coalesce to become the typical bizarre shaped cysts of LCH. In patien\\nts with LCH 95% have a smoking history. Specimen of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in three different stages On the left radiological pathological correlation of Langerhans cell hist\\niocytosis in respectively nodular stage and early and late cystic stage. Langerhans' cell histiocytosis On the left a chest film of a 19 year old patient with Langerhans cell histio\\ncytosis. The dominant findig on the chest film is a reticular patern and that's about as far as you can go. There is also hyperinflation. No way you would have recognized that this \\npattern was caused by multiple cysts. This is late stage Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The most challenging differential diagnosis in this patient is centrilobular emphysema. Emphy\\nsema however is defined as airspaces without definable walls. Usually we can identify the central dot sign. The upper lobe predominance is not helpfull in the differential as we can\\n appreciate this in many inhalational diseases and also in emphysema. Langerhans cell histiosytosis: early phase and late phase On the left another case of Langerhans' cell histiocy\\ntosis. It started as small noduli, which progressed over time to cavitating nodules. In the end this will progress to bizarre shaped cysts, that replace normal lung tissue. Video\\nImages of a young male smoker with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Notice progression on second scan 7 years later. Differential diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Emphysema\\n mimicking Langerhans cell histiocytosis Emphysema, when it is severe, can mimick Langerhans cell histiosytosis. When it extends beyond the centrilobular area to the edge of the sec\\nondary lobule, it may look as if it is cystic with walls. In patients with LCH, the pathologist may find LCH, but also areas of emphysema, respiratory bronchiolitis and even fibrosi\\ns. So these smoking-related diseases do not represent discrete entities. Alveolar proteinosis with crazy paving pattern\\nAlveolar proteinosis:\\nAlveolar proteinosis is a rare disease characterized by filling of the alveolar spaces with PAS positive material due to an abnormality in surfactant metabolism. The diagnosis is ba\\nsed on the suggestive HRCT pattern (crazy paving) and the characteristic features of BAL fluid (Broncho Alveolar Lavage) Key findings in alveolar proteinosis On the left a typical c\\nase of alveolar proteinosis with extensive thickening of interlobular and intra-lobular septa. This is caused by the fact that the proteinacious material, which is removed from the \\nalveolar space by macrophages is transported to the interstitium and thus leads to thickening of septa. The crazy paving pattern is a rather non-specific finding. Many other disease\\ns may present with this finding and are listed in the differential diagnosis.

The high prevalence of thyroid nodules combined with the generally indolent growth of thyroid c\\nancer present a challenge for optimal patient care. The Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) of the American College of Radiology (ACR) was designed in 2017 with the \\nintent to decrease biopsies of benign nodules and improve overall diagnostic accuracy.\\nTI-RADS categories:\\nClick to enlarge The five ultrasound features of thyroid nodules used in TI-RADS are: composition, echogenicity, shape, margin and punctate echogenic foci.

Nodules smaller than 5 mm do not need any follow-up, even if they are TI-RADS \\n5. \\nThis is because it is very unlikely that nodules smaller than 5 mm will become a clinical significant malignancy. The cutoff point of 2.5 cm for fine needle aspiration (FNA) in mild\\nly suspicious TR3 lesions is based on studies showing that thyroid carcinomas don’t have a decreased survival until they reach this threshold value.

There should be either: If there is no change in size for 5 years, the nodule \\ncan be considered as having a benign behavior, and further follow up is not needed. Comparison should be made with the oldest study available, and not (only) the last one. If there \\nis interval growth without fulfillment of FNA criteria, the next follow-up should be after 1 year, regardless of the TI-RADS category.\\nMultiple Nodules:\\nWhen there are multiple nodules, there should be no more than 4 nodules classified. FNA is not recommended of more than 2 nodules. In the case of multiple nodules, the nodule fulfil\\nling the TI-RADS FNA criteria should be sampled, which is not necessarily the dominant or largest nodule.\\nOverdiagnosis and Overtreatment:\\nOnce a thyroid nodule is detected, the binary question remains, is it benign or malignant? \\nDepending on the published series referenced, 6%–13% of thyroid nodules chosen for FNA will yield malignancy (1). The majority of thyroid cancers detected incidentally are papillary\\n in origin.\\nUnlike its malevolent associate anaplastic thyroid cancer, which while accounting for only 1%–2% of thyroid cancers is responsible for over half the cancer deaths, papillary thyroid\\n cancer is very benign. Since papillary is the dominant thyroid cancer and is well differentiated, the prognosis is remarkably good, with a reported 30-year survival of 95% (1).\\nAs most of these cancers would never have caused symptoms during life, the increased diagnostic scrutiny is causing overdiagnosis.\\nOur research focus should be the discovery of the small percentage of thyroid cancers that are aggressive and alter life spans.\\nExamples:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nBone tumors - Differential diagnosis:\\nHenk Jan van der Woude and Robin Smithuis\\nRadiology department of the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2010-04-10 / update 2022-03-17 In this article we will discuss a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions. The differe\\nntial diagnosis mostly depends on the review of the conventional radiographs and the age of the patient. Abbreviations used: SBC = Simple Bone Cyst Systematic Approach\\nSystematic Approach:\\nThe most important determinators in the analysis of a potential bone tumor are: It is important to realize that the plain radiograph is the most useful examination for differentiati\\nng these lesions.\\nCT and MRI are only helpful in selected cases. Here are links to other articles about bone tumors: Approach Most bone tumors are osteolytic. The most reliable indicator in determini\\nng whether these lesions are benign or malignant is the zone of transition between the lesion and the adjacent normal bone (1). Once we have decided whether a bone lesion is sclerot\\nic or osteolytic and whether it has a well-defined or ill-defined margins, the next question should be: how old is the patient?

              " Document(page_content=\"r clues need to be considered, such as a lesion's localization within the skeleton and within the bone, any periosteal reaction, cortical destruction, matrix calcifications, etc.\\nAge:\\nAge is the most important clinical clue in differentiating possible bone tumors.\\nThere are many ways of splitting age groups, as can be seen in the table, where  the morphology of a bone lesion is combined with the age of the patient. Some prefer to divide patie\\nnts into two age groups: younger or older than 30 years.\\nMost primary bone tumors are seen in patients under 30 years.\\nIn patients over 30 years we must always include metastases and myeloma in the differential diagnosis. Notice the following:\\nZone of transition:\\nIn order to classify osteolytic lesions as well-defined or ill-defined, we need to look at the zone of transition between the lesion and the adjacent normal bone. The zone of transi\\ntion is the most reliable indicator in determining whether an osteolytic lesion is benign or malignant (1). The zone of transition only applies to osteolytic lesions since sclerotic\\n lesions usually have a narrow transition zone. Narrow zone of transition: NOF, SBC and ABC Small zone of transitionA small zone of transition results in a sharp, well-defined borde\\nr and is a sign of slow growth.\\nA sclerotic border especially indicates poor biological activity. In patients\\nIn patients > 30 years, and particularly > 40 years, despite benign radiographic features, a metastasis or plasmacytoma also have to be considered On the left three bone lesions wit\\nh a narrow zone of transition. Based on the morphology and the age of the patients, these lesions are benign. Notice that in all three patients, the growth plates have not yet close\\nd. Images Metastases and multiple myelomaIn patients > 40 years metastases and multiple myeloma are the most common bone tumors.\\nMetastases under the age of 40 are extremely rare, unless a patient is known to have a primary malignancy.\\nMetastases could be included in the differential diagnosis if a younger patient is known to have a malignancy, such as neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or retinoblastoma. Wide zone o\\nf transition indicates malignancy or infection or eosinophilic granuloma Wide zone of transition An ill-defined border with a broad zone of transition is a sign of aggressive growth\\n (1). It is a feature of malignant bone tumors. There are two tumor-like lesions which may mimic a malignancy and have to be included in the differential diagnosis. These are infect\\nions and eosinophilic granuloma. Both of these entities may have an aggressive growth pattern. Images Infections and eosinophilic granuloma\\nInfections and eosinophilic granuloma are exceptional because they are benign lesions which can mimick a malignant bone tumor due to their aggressive biologic behavior. These lesion\\ns may have ill-defined margins, but cortical destruction and an aggressive type of periosteal reaction may also be seen.\\nPeriosteal reaction:\\nA periosteal reaction is a non-specific reaction and will occur whenever the periosteum is irritated by a malignant tumor, benign tumor, infection or trauma. There are two patterns \\nof periosteal reaction: a benign and an aggressive type. The benign type is seen in benign lesions such as benign tumors and following trauma. An aggressive type is seen in malignan\\nt tumors, but also in benign lesions with aggressive behavior, such as infections and eosinophilic granuloma. Fibrous dysplasia, Enchondroma, NOF and SBC are common bone lesions.\\nThey will not present with a periosteal reaction unless there is a fracture.\\nIf no fracture is present, these bone tumors can be excluded. Benign periosteal reaction Detecting a benign periosteal reaction may be very helpful, since malignant lesions never ca\\nuse a benign periosteal reaction. A benign type of periosteal reaction is a thick, wavy and uniform callus formation resulting from chronic irritation. In the case of benign, slowly\\n growing lesions, the periosteum has time to lay down thick new bone and remodel it into a more normal-appearing cortex. ImageBenign periosteal reaction in an osteoid osteoma.\\nLarge arrow indicates solid periosteal reaction.\\nSmall arrow indicates nidus. Aggressive periosteal reaction This type of periostitis is multilayered, lamellated or demonstrates bone formation perpendicular to the cortical bone. I\\nt may be spiculated and interrupted - sometimes there is a Codman's triangle. A Codman's triangle refers to an elevation of the periosteum away from the cortex, forming an angle whe\\nre the elevated periosteum and bone come together. In aggressive periostitis the periosteum does not have time to consolidate. Aggressive periosteal reaction Aggressive periosteal r\\neaction (2) Osteosarcoma (left) and Ewings sarcoma (right)\\nCortical destruction:\\nCortical destruction is a common finding, and not very useful in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. Complete destruction may be seen in high-grade malignant lesion\\ns, but also in locally aggressive benign lesions like EG and osteomyelitis. More uniform cortical bone destruction can be found in benign and low-grade malignant lesions. Endosteal \\nscalloping of the cortical bone can be seen in benign lesions like Fybrous dysplasia and low-grade chondrosarcoma. Images Chondromyxoid fibroma (left), Giant cell tumor (right) Ball\\nooningBallooning is a special type of cortical destruction.\\nIn ballooning the destruction of endosteal cortical bone and the addition of new bone on the outside occur at the same rate, resulting in expansion. This 'neocortex' can be smooth a\\nnd uninterrupted, but may also be focally interrupted in more aggressive lesions like GCT. Images A benign, well-defined, expansile lesion with regular destruction of cortical bone \\nand a peripheral layer of new bone.\\n2. Giant cell tumor A locally aggressive lesion with cortical destruction, expansion and a thin, interrupted peripheral layer of new bone. Notice the wide zone of transition towards\\n the marrow cavity, which is a sign of aggressive behavior (red arrow). Ewing's sarcoma with permeative growth through the haversian channels accompanied by a large soft tissue mass\\n Cortical destruction (3) In the group of malignant small round cell tumors which include Ewing's sarcoma, bone lymphoma and small cell osteosarcoma, the cortex may appear almost no\\nrmal radiographically, while there is permeative growth throughout the Haversian channels. These tumors may be accompanied by a large soft tissue mass while there is almost no visib\\nle bone destruction.

Performance of imaging in accurate prediction of disease depends on the \\nlikelihood of disease before the test was done. \\nIf regional COVID-19 prevalence is high, the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantial in a patient with fever, dyspnea and an abnormal CT. This likelihood changes if clinic\\nal signs are less suspicious, or if regional prevalence of COVID-19 is low.\\nIntroduction:\\nProven COVID-19 cases. Click on image to enlarge. During the peak of the first wave of COVID-19  the a priori probability that patients, who came to the hospital with dyspnoe, cough\\ning and fever, actually had COVID-19 was high especially if they have an abnormal chest-CT. The images are all of patients with proven COVID-19 infection. The CT's were classified a\\ns CO-RADS 5, which indicates a very high probability of COVID-19. Chest CT can be helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients as an adjunct to PCR testing and sero\\nlogy. The CO-RADS classification uses features of COVID-19 on chest CT to indicate the likelihood of COVID-19 pulmonary involvement based on CT imaging (ref Prokop et al). Click her\\ne for more information about CO-RADS. The CO-RADS classification is accurate in the clinical setting of hospitalized patients with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and symptom du\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

The performance of the CO-RADS classification decreases in patients without typical complaints of COVID-19 (ref), short symptom du\\nration, and in patients with overlapping or pre-existing pulmonary disease. \\nIn those cases we have to consider other diseases in the differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of COVID-19 can be arbitrary divided into 3 subgroups: It is therefore im\\nportant to take the appropriate clinical setting into account when applying CO-RADS, as a false positive CT-result may result in unnecessary treatment and isolation. In addition, fr\\naming bias should be avoided by taking the differential diagnoses of COVID-19 CT signs into consideration and to correlate these to the clinical history of the patient.\\nGroundglass mimickers:\\nDiffuse high density of the lung parenchyma can be caused by inadequate inspiration.\\nInadequate inspiration:\\nNotice the presence of inward bowing of the posterior membrane, indicative of inadequate inspiration.

In addition, distribution of edema can be gravity dependent, which can be appreciated on sagittal rec\\nonstructions. Pulmonary cardiogenic edema with centrally distributed groundglass, diffuse vascular enlargement, lymphnode enlargement and bronchial cuffing. Accompanying signs sugge\\nstive of cardiogenic edema:\\nPulmonary infarctions:\\nInfarctions secondary to pulmonary emboli cause peripheral densities adjacent to the pleural surfaces. Although these densities in part consist of ground-glass opacities, especially\\n in the early stage, infarctions are frequently more peripheral, triangular and dense. The images show: Alveloar hemorrhage in a patient with SLE.\\nAlveolar hemorrhage:\\nBilateral and confluent airspace opacities caused by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage such as in e.g. systemic lupus erythomathosus on this image are distributed more along the bronchova\\nscular bundles, and predominantly spare the peripheral pleural surfaces and costophrenic angles. These opacities should resolve in weeks if bleeding does not recur. The image shows \\nalveloar hemorrhage with patchy groundglass along the bronchovascular bundles in a patient with secondary vasculitis in systemic lupus erythemathosus. In COVID-19 the groundglass is\\n more peripheral and diffuse. More chronic or subacute hemorrhage causes crazy paving and fibrosis.

Differentiation from COVID-19 is possible based on: Drug-induced pneunmonitis with groundglass, reticulation, crazy paving and consolidations (left), which resolved after dr\\nug withdrawal (right).\\nDrug-induced pneumonitis:\\nDrugs can cause CT patterns similar to confirmatory patterns of COVID-19, including ground glass, peripheral consolidations, crazy paving and organizing pneumonia patterns. The appr\\nopriate clinical setting of potentially pneumotoxic drugs and clear improvement after drug withdrawal (right) helps in suggesting this differential diagnosis. A list of pneumotoxic \\ndrugs and the findings on CT is found on www.pneumotox.com. Stationary groundglass and consolidations in the right lung after radiation therapy\\nRadiation pneumonitis:\\nInflammatory and fibrotic changes associated with radiotherapy can cause peripheral ground-glass and consolidations in the area of the radiation therapy field. However, bilateral or\\nganizing pneumonia outside the radiation field can also occur, mimicking one of the confirmatory feature of COVID-19. Correlation with the radiotherapy field and stationary location\\n of abnormalities over time can virtually always confirm radiation pneumonitis.

If the lesion is of near water density, \\nhomogeneous, has sharp margins and shows no enhancement, then it is a cyst. If the lesion does enhance, then the next step is to determine whether the lesion could be a hemangioma, \\nsince this is by far the most common liver tumor. The enhancement should be peripheral and nodular, with the same density as the bloodpool in all phases. If it is not a cyst nor a h\\nemangioma, then we further have to study the lesion. Based on the enhancement pattern, we divide masses into hypervascular and hypovascular lesions. Usually a combination of the enh\\nancement pattern and gross pathologic features, like the presence of fat, blood, calcifications, cystic or fibrotic components, in combination with the clinical history will limit t\\nhe differential diagnosis (figure).\\nRadiology department of the University of Chicago:\\nPublicationdate 2006-07-15 This article is based on a presentation given by Richard Baron and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Richard Baron is Chair of Radiol\\nogy at the University of Chicago and well known for his work on hepatobiliary diseases. He has been president of the Society of Computed Body Tomography and Magnetic Resonance. In P\\nart I a basic concept is given on how to detect and characterize livermasses with CT. In Part II the imaging features of the most common hepatic tumors are presented. Interactive ca\\nses are presented in the menubar to test your knowledge (Liver mass 1 and 2).\\nDetection of liver masses:\\nSmall Hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic liver not visible on NECT (left), clearly visible in arterial phase (middle) and not visible in portal venous phase (right) The conspicui\\nty of a liver lesion depends on the attenuation difference between the lesion and the normal liver. On a non enhanced CT-scan (NECT) liver tumors usually are not visible, because th\\ne inherent contrast between tumor tissue and the surrounding liver parenchyma is too low. Only a minority of tumors contain calcifications, cystic components, fat or hemorrage and w\\nill be detected on a NECT. So i.v. contrast is needed to increase the conspicuity of lesions. When we give i.v. contrast, it is important to understand, that there is a dual blood s\\nupply to the liver. Normal parenchyma is supplied for 80% by the portal vein and only for 20% by the hepatic artery, so it will enhance in the portal venous phase. All liver tumors \\nhowever get 100% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery, so when they enhance it will be in the arterial phase. This difference in bloodsupply results in different enhancemen\\nt patterns between liver tumors and normal liver parenchyma in the various phases of contrast enhancement (figure). Detection of a lesion depends on difference in attenuation betwee\\nn liver and lesion.LEFT: Arterial phase showing hypervascular FNHMIDDLE: Portal venous phase showing hypovascular metastasisRIGHT: equilibrium phase showing relatively dense cholang\\niocarcinoma In the arterial phase hypervascular tumors will enhance via the hepatic artery, when normal liver parenchyma does not yet enhances, because contrast is not yet in the po\\nrtal venous system. These hypervascular tumors will be visible as hyperdense lesions in a relatively hypodense liver. However when the surrounding liver parenchyma starts to enhance\\n in the portal venous phase, these hypervascular lesion may become obscured. In the portal venous phase hypovascular tumors are detected, when the normal liver parenchyma enhances m\\naximally. These hypovascular tumors will be visible as hypodense lesions in a relatively hyperdense liver. In the equilibrium phase at about 10 minutes after contrast injection, tum\\nors become visible, that either loose their contrast slower than normal liver, or wash out their contrast faster than normal liver parenchyma. These lesions will become either relat\\nively hyperdense or hypodense to the normal liver. CT of the liver in the early arterial phase (left) and the late arterial pase (right).\\nArterial phase imaging:\\nOptimal timing and speed of contrast injection are very important for good arterial phase imaging. Hypervascular tumors will enhance optimally at 35 sec after contrast injection (la\\nte arterial phase). This time is needed for the contrast to get from the peripheral vein to the hepatic artery and to diffuse into the liver tumor. On the left a patient who underwe\\nnt two phases of arterial imaging at 18 and 35 seconds.\\nIn the early arterial phase we nicely see the arteries, but we only see some irregular enhancement within the liver. In the late arterial phase we can clearly identify multiple tumo\\nr masses. Notice that in the late arterial phase there has to be some enhancement of the portal vein. The only time that an early arterial phase is needed is when you need an arteri\\nogram, for instance as a roadmap for chemoembolization of a liver tumor. Patient with liver cirrhosis and multifocal HCC injected at 2.5ml/sec (left) and at 5ml/sec (right). Timing \\nof scanning is important, but almost as important is speed of contrast injection. For arterial phase imaging the best results are with an injection rate of 5ml/sec. There are two re\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"asons for this better enhancement: at 5ml/sec there will be more contrast delivered to the liver when you start scanning and this contrast arrives in a higher concentration. On the \\nleft a patient with cirrhosis examined after contrast injection at 2.5ml/sec and at 5ml/sec. At 5ml/sec there is far better contrast enhancement and better tumor detection. Hypovasc\\nular metastases seen as hypodense lesions in the late portal venous phase. Notice some rim enhancement of the more viable peripheral areas of the metastases.\\nPortal Venous phase:\\nPortal venous phase imaging works on the opposite idea. We image the liver when it is loaded with contrast through the portal vein to detect hypovascular tumors (figure). The best m\\noment to start scanning is at about 75 seconds, so this is a late portal venous phase, because enhancement of the portal vein already starts at 35 sec in the late arterial phase. Th\\nis late portal venous phase is also called the hepatic phase because there already must be enhancement of the hepatic veins.\\nIf you do not seen enhancement of the hepatic veins, you are too early. If you only do portal venous imaging, for instance if you are only looking for hypovascular metastases in col\\norectal cancer, fast contrast injection is not needed, because in this phase the total amount of contrast is more important and 3ml/sec will be sufficient.\\nEquilibrium Phase:\\nThe equilibrium phase is when contrast is moving away from the liver and the liver starts to decrease in density. This phase begins at about 3-4 minutes after contrast injection and\\n imaging is best done at 10 minutes after contrast injection. This phase can be valuable if you're looking for: fast tumor washout in hypervascular tumors like HCC or retention of c\\nontrast in the blood pool as in hemangiomas or the retention of contrast in fibrous tissue in capsules (HCC) or scar tissue (FNH, Cholangioca). Small cholangiocarcinoma not visible \\nin portal venous phase (left), but seen as relative hyperdense lesion in the delayed phase (right). Relative hyperdense lesions in the delayed phase Fibrous tissue that's well organ\\nized and dense is very slow to let iodine or gadolineum in. Once contrast gets in however, it is equally slow to get back out in the equilibrium phase. So when the normal liver pare\\nnchyma washes out, the fibrous components of a tumor will look brighter than the background liver tissue. Cholangiocarcinoma may have a fibrous stroma and in the delayed phase it ma\\ny be the only time when you see the tumor (figure). HCC in a cirrhotic liver. Notice fast wash out in equilibrium phase compared to surrounding liver parenchyma. Relative hypodense \\nlesions in the delayed phase On the left the importance of the delayed phase in a cirrhotic patient with an HCC is demonstrated. Notice that you do not see the tumor on the nonenhan\\nced scan and also not in the portal venous phase. This is often the case and demonstrates the importance of the arterial phase. Now the issue at hand is in small enhancing lesions i\\nn a cirrhotic liver whether it is a benign lesion like a regenerating nodule or a HCC. In the delayed phase we see that the tumor is washed out more than the surrounding liver paren\\nchyma. Benign lesions typically will not show this kind of wash out. For instance a FNH or adenoma will show fast enhancement in the arterial phase, become isodense in the portal ve\\nnous phase, but it will stay isodense with liver in the equilibrium phase. These benign tumors do not have enough neoplastic neovascularity to have a fast wash out. Especially in ci\\nrrhotic patients you have to rely heavily on this delayed phase to differentiate benign little enhancing lesions from small HCC's. Hemangioma on NECT, late arterial, late portal ven\\nous and equilibrium phase. Notice that the attenuation of the hemangioma matches the bloodpool in every single phase (arrows).\\nBlood pool and Hemangioma:\\nNormally when we look at lesions filling with contrast, the density of these lesions is always compared to the density of the liver parenchyma. In hemangiomas however you should not\\n compare the density of the lesion to the liver, but to the blood pool. This means that the areas of enhancement in a hemangioma should match the attenuation of the appropriate vess\\nels (bloodpool) at all times.\\nSo in the arterial phase the enhancing parts of the lesion must have almost the same attenuation value as the enhancing aorta , while in the portal venous phase it must match the en\\nhancement of the portal vein. If it does not match the bloodpool in every single phase of contrast enhancement forget the diagnosis of a hemangioma. On the left a characteristic hem\\nangioma.\\nNotice that on the NECT the density of the tumor is the same as the density of the vessels. In the arterial phase it is matching the bloodpool and the attenuation is almost the same\\n as the aorta.\\nIn the portal venous phase it matches the density of the portal vein.\\nIn the equlibrium phase it has the same enhancement as the vessels. Eventually the lesion will become iso-attenuating to the liver, but only because the vessels become iso-attenuati\\nng with the liver.\\nIt has nothing to do with the density of the liver parenchyma itself. So think of bloodpool rather than liver if you're thinking of a hemangioma.\\nTailored CT protocol:\\nYou have to adapt your protocol to the type of scanner, the speed of contrast injection and to the kind of patient that you are examining. If you have a single slice scanner, it wil\\nl take about 20 seconds to scan the liver. For late arterial phase imaging 35 sec is the optimal time, so you start at about 25 seconds and end at about 45 seconds. However if you h\\nave a 64-slice scanner, you will be able to examine the whole liver in 4 seconds. So you start scanning at about 33 seconds, which is much later. In aterial phase imaging the time w\\nindow is narrow, since you have only limited time before the surrounding liver will start to enhance and obscure a hypervascular lesion. For portal venous phase imaging it is differ\\nent. Here you don't want to be too early, because you want to load the liver with contrast and it takes time for contrast to get from the portal vein into the liver parenchyma.\\nBesides you have more time, because the delayed or equilibrium phase starts at about 3-4 minutes. So you start at 75 seconds with whatever scanner you have.\\nOnly when you inject with high speed at 5ml/sec you may start earlier at about 65-70 seconds. Use arterial phase imaging in the following situations:\\nHypervascular lesions:\\nArterially enhancing lesions are mostly benign lesions and include primary liver tumors as FNH, adenoma and small hemangiomas that fill rapidly with contrast. These benign tumors ha\\nve to be differentiated from the most common hypervascular malignant liver tumor, which is HCC and metastases from hypervascular tumors like melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast, \\nsarcoma and neuroendocrine tumors (islet cell tumors, carcinoid, pheochromocytoma). Four different tumors with enhancement in the late arterial phase. From left to right: HCC in cir\\nrhotic liver; FNH with central scar in adolescent; adenoma in young woman on contraceptives and finally a hemangioma with typical enhancement in the other phases (not shown). Hyperv\\nascular lesions may look very similar in the arterial phase (figure). Differentiation is done by looking at the enhancement pattern in the other phases and additional gross patholog\\nic features together with clinical findings. Hypervascular metastases will be considered in patients with a known primary tumor. In general HCC is considered when there is a setting\\n of cirrhosis, while FNH is considered in young women and hepatic adenoma in patients on oral contraceptives, anabolic steroids or with a history of glycogen storage disease.\\nHypovascular lesions:\\nHypovascular liver tumors are more common than hypervascular tumors. Most hypovascular lesions are malignant and metastases are by far the most common. Although primary liver tumors\\n are mostly hypervascular, there are exceptions. 10% of HCC is hypovascular. Cholangioca is hypovascular, but may show delayed enhancement (figure). Cholangiocarcinoma with relative\\n hyperdense scar tissue in the equilibrium phase (arrow). On the left a hypovascular mass with irregular enhancement in the late arterial and late portal venous phase. This is a sig\\nn of malignancy. On the delayed images a relative dense structure is seen centrally, which looses its contrast slower compared to normal liver. This means that this tumor is mainly \\ncomposed of fibrous tissue. \\nThe fibrous tissue has also retracted the liver capsule. These imaging findings are very suggestive of a cholangiocarcinoma.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Scar:\\nLiver lesions which may have a central scar are FNH, fibrolamellar carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hemangioma and hepatocellular carcinoma. On CT a scar is sometimes visible as a hyp\\nodense structure. On MR scar tissue is hypointense on both T1WI and T2WI due to intense fibrotic changes. An example is the central scar of fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) An exceptio\\nn to this rule is the central scar in FNH which is hyperintense on T2WI due to edema. T2WI can be very helpfull if there is a problem in differentiating FNH from FLC. Both on CT and\\n MRI scar tissue will enhance in the delayed phase. FNH with central scar seen in NECT, portal venous phase and equilibrium phase. On the left a lesion with a typical central scar. \\nIt has a hypodense centre on the NECT.

NECT and Arterial phase image showin\\ng hypodense capsule of HCC\\nCapsule:\\nLiver lesions which may have a capsule are Adenoma, HCC and cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. The most common tumor with a capsule is HCC. The capsule will not enhance in the arter\\nial phase and even in the portal venous phase it will be hypodense, because the fibrous tissue enhances very slowly. A capsule is usually best seen in the delayed phase as a relativ\\ne hyperdense structure.

Hemorrhage within an adenoma.\\nHemorrhage:\\nHemorrhage in liver tumors is seen in: Hemorrhage is most commonly seen in adenomas. The case on the left shows a well circumscribed lesion with hemorrhage. At resection the lesion \\nproved to be an adenoma.\\nCystic components:\\nIf a lesion has a near water density in the centre and does not show enhancement in the centre, we usually will call it a cystic lesion. You have to realize, that it still can be a \\ntumor as in cystic metastases or metastases with central necrosis. Secondly you always have to add absces to the differential diagnosis. On the left a patient with hypovascular lesi\\nons with a low density, so it may be cystic i.e fluid containing. These lesions are multiple, but not spread out through the liver, so we describe them as clustered or satelite lesi\\nons. This is a typical finding which makes the lesions suspective for liver abcesses. This was a case of diverticulitis. The common route is through the portal vein as a result of a\\nbdominal infection. The bacteria enter the slow flow portal system, where they layer within the vessel and finally these bacteria 'fall down' into the dependent portion of the right\\n lobe. CT and T2W MR-image of echinococcus cyst. On the left a typical case of a echinococcus cyst with 'daughter cysts' within the large cyst. Most cases of echinococcus cysts howe\\nver are not that typical. If you look at the CT image on the left, the first impression might be that there are only simple cysts within the liver. However, if you look more careful\\nly, you will notice that some of the hypodense lesions show vague rim enhancement. And although you might think that these could be cystic metastases, the US-findings clearly show, \\nthat these lesions are hyperechoic solid masses. So you have to be very carefull in calling a lesion cystic, because you might end up missing metastases or looking in the wrong file\\n for a differential diagnosis. Hepatic and delayed phase in a patient with breast metastases causing retraction of liver capsule. Notice delayed enhancement of the fibrotic tissue (\\narrows)\\nRetraction of liver capsule:\\nMost liver tumors will present as a mass. Some tumors however have an infiltrative growth pattern with a lot of fibrous tissue and do not cause mass effect. As the fibrous stroma ma\\ntures, the tissue will contract and cause retraction of the liver capsule (figure). Breast cancer metastases can be infiltrative. When they shrink they can cause multiple retraction\\ns. This will give a pseudo-cirrhosis appearance. Delayed phase image of a cholangiocarcinoma with relative dense fibrous stroma with retraction of liver capsule The most common tumo\\nr however to cause retraction is cholangiocarcinoma. The delayed image on the left shows a large cholangiocarcinoma with dense enhancing fibrous tissue and retraction of the liver c\\napsule. Notice the resemblance with the case above. Another cause of local retraction is atrophy due to biliary obstruction or chronic portal venous obstruction. Hepatic and delayed\\n phase in a patient with multifocal cholangiocarcinoma causing retraction of liver capsule. On the left another case of cholangiocarcinoma with multifocal lesions. Notice the retrac\\ntion and the delayed enhancement of the fibrotic component of the tumor. LEFT: rim enhancement in metastasis. RIGHT: hemangioma with discontinuous nodular peripheral enhancement\\nPeripheral enhancement and progressive fill in:\\nMany will regard 'peripheral enhancement and progressive fill in' as a typical feature of hemangioma, but it is not. Peripheral rim enhancement is a typical feature of malignant les\\nions and only discontinuous nodular peripheral enhancement that matches bloodpool is a typical feature of hemangioma. Progressive fill in in a hemangioma (left), cholangiocarcinoma \\n(middle) and metastases (right). Many lesions will show progressive fill in. In hemangiomas this progressive fill in must have the same density as the bloodpool. Many hypovascular m\\netastases will show contrast diffusion into a lesion starting on the outside. Usually the center does not fill in. Cholangiocarcinomas will show progressive fill in because the fibr\\nous centre will enhance slowly. You will see it enhance in the delayed phase (see part II) So if you want to make the diagnosis of a hemangioma you have to look at all the other pha\\nses to see if the enhancement matches the bloodpool.\\nNone:\\nPancreatic cystic Lesions:\\nDiagnosis and management:\\nMarc Engelbrecht, Jennifer Bradshaw and Robin Smithuis\\nRadiology department of the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate update 21-3-20 Cystic pancreatic lesions are increasingly identified due to the widespread use of CT and MRI.\\nCertain pancreatic cysts represent premalignant lesions and may transform into mucin-producing adenocarcinoma.

This scheme is a simplified roadmap for\\n the differentiation of pancreatic cysts. LEFT: Pseudocyst. RIGHT: Cystic neoplasm. The left CT-image is of a patient with a history of pancreatitis. There are two unilocular or sim\\nple cysts. Notice also the retroperitoneal fat-stranding on the right. The most likely diagnosis is pseudocysts. The CT on the right shows a cyst in the pancreatic tail in a 36 year\\n old woman, which was found incidentally with US. The cyst has a thick irregular rim and contains solid 'non-dependent' components. The most likely diagnosis is a cystic neoplasm.

The images show a serous cystic neo\\nplasm (SCN) on a CT.\\nMRI better shows the central scar. Serous cystic neoplasm with central calcification.

MRI shows a lesion, which consists of mult\\niple small cysts. This could be a serous cystic neoplasm or a branch-duct IPMN. The connection of the cystic lesion to the pancreatic duct indicates that this is a branch-duct IPMN.\\nPseudocyst:\\nPseudocyst Key findings: The CT demonstrates a large cyst in the upper abdomen in a patient who had an acute pancreatitis (Fig).

Cystic primary lung cancer is often missed or misinterpreted, which is most likely due to their unique imaging appearance, showing overla\\np with benign entities such as infection. The appearance is different from solid and subsolid nodules, which are the more commonly known CT appearances of lung cancer (fig).\\nTerminology:\\nExamples of cystic lung cancer with an exophytic (left panel) and endophytic (right panel) solid component. A cystic pulmonary nodule may be defined as solid and/or ground glass att\\nenuation in relation to a well-defined parenchymal air space. A cystic nodule may demonstrate: Examples of cystic lung cancer The images show more examples of cystic lung cancer wit\\nh a thin (left panel) and thick (middle panel) irregular wall thickening, and a more complex appearance with extensive ground glass and multilocular air spaces (right panel). Severa\\nl classification systems have been proposed based on this imaging morphology [1,2]. Clinical implications of any subclassification are yet unknown and therefore they are of limited \\nvalue for routine radiology care. Cystic lung cancer with increase of the solid component over a 2-year scan interval. Solidification Solidification is the opposite of cavitation.\\nSolidification is a process that is often demonstrated by cystic lung cancers – where the solid tissue component increases over time and may eventually even obliterate previous grou\\nnd glass and/or cystic air spaces completely, leading to a solid mass. Cystic lung cancer demonstrating ‘solidification’ Here another example of a cystic lung cancer demonstrating ‘\\nsolidification’ from a baseline precursor lesion with subtle irregular wall thickening into a solid mass at time of diagnosis. It is important to note that cavitation – which is the\\n process of central lucency formation due to expulsion of necrotic tumour content – can only be assessed on serial CT.\\nAlthough very often encountered in reports of single time point CT, this term should be applied with caution.\\nIt may insinuate a differential diagnosis of infection or other disease that steers away from the correct diagnosis of a primary lung cancer that is most likely an adenocarcinoma [3\\n,4]. The images show another example of a cystic lung cancer demonstrating ‘solidification’.\\nDaily practice:\\nPatient with a T1c adenocarcinoma in the left upper lobe (left panel). Growing synchronous cystic lesion in the right lower lobe (right panel) that represented an unrelated second p\\nrimary adenocarcinoma on histopathology. In daily practice The prevalence of cystic lung cancer is not well established and ranges between 0.5% and 12%, depending on study populatio\\nn selection [1,5,6].\\nPresumably, cystic lung cancer morphology is not uncommon at all [4]. Several recognized associations are of specific importance to radiologists during daily CT reporting, as increa\\nsed awareness and active search should be demonstrated in this population. First, it has been recognized that cystic lung cancer regularly represents a secondary primary malignancy,\\n either metachronous or synchronous with the first lung cancer (figure). Second, a high percentage of patients with cystic lung cancer are (ex-)smokers and have pre-existent emphyse\\nma, although cystic lung cancers undeniably do occur in otherwise normal lungs. Third, cystic lung cancers tend to occur in the periphery of the lung, which makes it a relevant enti\\nty to all radiologists who image part of the lungs, specifically neuro, abdominal and ER radiologists. Cystic squamous cell carcinoma. These images are of a patient with a left lowe\\nr lobe cystic squamous cell carcinoma (left panel), who developed a right lower lobe cystic lesion (right panel) and subcarinal lymphadenopathy 3 years into follow-up. Although init\\nially considered contralateral metastatic disease, recommended tissue analysis showed an unrelated second primary squamous cell carcinoma on histopathology.\\nHistopathology:\\nCheck-valve mechanism due to tumor cells (in red) in terminal airway Cystic lung cancers are predominantly adenocarcinomas in about 80% of cases, with squamous cell carcinomas as th\\ne second most common subtype. \\nA rare number of other tumour types like adenosquamous, neuroendocrine and lymphoma have been reported. Multiple underlying histopathologic substrates (eg. focal tumour proliferatio\\nn, fibrosis, lepidic tumour growth along alveolar walls, emphysema) relate to the imaging features of cystic lung cancer and are responsible for either the solid component, septatio\\nns, ground glass, and cystic air spaces [1,5,7]. The most widely quoted mechanism of air space formation is “check-valve” ventilation. The air can enter in inspiration but cannot re\\nturn during expiration due to partial obstruction of the terminal airway proximal to the cystic air space due to tumour cells and fibrosis. This leads to development, persistency an\\nd enlargement of the cystic air space. courtesy of JC English Radiologic-histopathologic correlation of a squamous cell carcinoma.\\nA cystic air space lined is by tumour cells (asterisk) most likely represents a dilated distal airway. \\nCheck-valve ventilation due to more proximal airway narrowing by malignant cells and/or fibrosis is presumed.

Cystic lung cancers are progressive lesions, inherent to their maligna\\nnt aetiology. \\nAlthough they may be aggressive, many are rather slow-growing adenocarcinomas. CT morphology may remain cystic over time, however, when the independent contribution of the underlyin\\ng histopathologic substrates changes, lesion morphology may change over time. Example showing transition from cystic (left and middle panel) to part-solid lung cancer morphology (ri\\nght panel). Cystic nodules will either show increase of solid components, develop additional ground glass and cystic components and demonstrate increase in total lesion size. It has\\n retrospectively been shown that cystic lung cancers can both develop from small subsolid precursor lesions, as well as change from cystic precursor lesions into solid or subsolid c\\nancers at time of diagnosis. Lung cancer morphology is thus fluent and cystic components may be temporary. This example shows transition from part-solid (left panel), to temporarily\\n cystic (middle panel), to solid lung cancer morphology (right panel).\\nMimickers:\\nThere are multiple benign diseases that may look like cystic primary lung cancer, including [3,4,8]: Previous imaging (including non-chest imaging), clinical information and lab val\\nues, as well as past medical history are often helpful to differentiate a suspected primary lung cancer from other aetiology. \\nIn the absence of an overt underlying benign cause, any new lung cyst or cystic air space with associated subsolid component should raise the suspicion for a primary lung malignancy\\n and managed accordingly with CT surveillance or biopsy, if appropriate. Mimickers of cystic lung cancer: Persistent loculated air space - left panel, rheumatoid nodule - middle pan\\nel and a scar - right panel. The images are examples of mimickers of cystic lung cancer morphology. Absolute malignancy risk of solitary cystic nodules is currently unknown, as that\\n would require prospective surveillance of all benign and malignant cystic nodules in a given cohort.\\nNodule management:\\nMultiloculated cystic lesion (left panel) interpreted as “non-specific”, despite a 6-month follow-up CT (for another reason) showed mild increase of ground glass, cystic air spaces \\nand overall lesion size. The next CT was obtained for chest pain 2 years later, showing a large mass invading the chest wall (right panel). Patient died from metastatic lung adenoca\\nrcinoma. The currently available screening (Lung-RADS) or clinical (BTS and Fleischner) nodule management guidelines do not include cystic lung nodules. \\nAlthough no uniform guidance is provided and optimal surveillance strategy is unknown, it is crucial that these lesions are not lost to follow-up in order to prevent diagnostic dela\\ny and associated patient burden. Pending potential incorporation into future guideline versions, the following strategy might be reasonable when a suspicious cystic nodule is encoun\\ntered: The images show a small cystic precursor lesion (left panel) initially interpreted as “thin-walled cavity, likely infection”. The next CT was obtained for cough 4 years later\\n, showing a T4 squamous cell carcinoma (right panel). Patient was alive 2 years after resection and systemic treatment.\\nStaging:\\nPossible overestimation of tumour burden due to inclusion of the cystic air space component in the total lesion size, when measured according to TNM 8th edition (stippled lines). Th\\ne solid line (left panel) may better represent the invasive tumour component and associated prognosis. Despite the unique morphology of cystic lung cancer, staging is performed acco\\nrding to the ‘standard’ TNM 8th edition, which stages patient groups based on their prognosis. However, measuring complex cystic lesions on CT may be prone to variability and one ma\\ny posit that total lesion size (including the sometimes large cystic component) overestimates the total tumour burden, as it is more likely that the invasive solid component relates\\n to the prognosis. Future consideration of an adjusted classification might be reasonable, as is available for subsolid pulmonary malignancies [9].\\nNone:\\nTLICS Classification of fractures:\\nThoraco-Lumbar Injury Classification and Severity score:\\nby Clark West, Stefan Roosendaal, Joost Bot and Frank Smithuis\\nDepartment of Radiology and Regional Spinal Cord Injury Center of the Delaware Valley, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia and the Radiology Department of the Free Un\\niversity Medical Center and the Academical Medical Center, Amsterdam:\\nPublicationdate 2015-05-01 The Thoraco-Lumbar Injury Classification and Severity score (TLICS) is a classification system for thoracolumbar spine injuries, designed to assist in cli\\nnical management. Unlike other classifications, the TLICS is an easy scoring system that depicts the features important in predicting spinal stability, future deformity, and progres\\nsive neurologic compromise. TLICS also facilitates appropriate treatment recommendations.\\nIntroduction:\\nMost classification systems of spine injuries are based on injury mechanisms and describe how the injury occurred. This is all based on the premise that a fracture caused by forward\\n flexion should be treated by undoing the flexion by positioning the patient in an extension brace, or by surgical intervention correcting the spinal column in extension. Some of th\\ne injuries thought to be due to extension mechanisms, however, turn out to be due to flexion and vice versa. These descriptions may thus be misleading. A problem with classification\\ns such as the AO-classification is that they are usually complex, leading to high inter-reader variability. Using the popular Denis three-column classification may lead to another s\\nituation since it uses the terms stable and unstable. In many cases, however, there is no good correlation with the necessity for surgery. Furthermore, the word stability itself is \\nambiguous and may refer to direct osseous stability; it may refer to neurological stability and finally, to long-term (ligamentous) stability. Both of these commonly used systems fa\\nil to systematically take into account the neurological status of the patient and the indication for MRI to determine the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex. For these r\\neasons the Spine Trauma Study Group introduced in 2005 the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Scale (1), with intention to be a reliable, ease-to-use tool to facilitat\\ne clinical decision making and as a practical alternative to cumbersome classification systems already in use. The TLICS consists of three independent parameters: A parameter can be\\n scored 0-4 points and the total score is the sum of these parameters with a maximum of 10 points. The total score predicts the need for surgery as is shown in the TLICS algorithm. \\nA total of more than 4 points indicates surgical treatment. A compression fracture gets 1 point. When it is complicated by a burst, it gets an additional 1 point, resulting in 2 poi\\nnts. The integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex plays an important role in the TLICS. Sometimes it will be possible to determine PLC injury on CT, but MRI may be necessary. \\nWhen there are several fractures, each level has to be scored separately. The level with the highest TLICS score will determine the type of treatment. Morphology and PLC are scored \\nseparately. For example, in a translation/rotation injury, the PLC is always involved, making a total of 3+3=6 points.

              " Document(page_content='Posterior Ligamentous Complex:\\nThe PLC serves as a posterior \"tension band\" of the spinal column and plays an important role in the stability of the spine (3). A torn PLC has a tendency not to heal and can lead t\\no progressive kyphosis and collapse. The PLC is composed of the supraspinous ligaments, interspinous ligaments, articular facet capsules, and ligamenta flava (figure). The supraspin\\nous ligament is a strong, cordlike ligament which connects the tips of the spinous processes from C7 to the sacrum. The interspinous ligaments are weak, thin, membranous structures \\nconnecting the adjacent spinous processes. The contractile force of the ligamenta flava presses the vertebrae together and keeps them aligned. The facet joints act against rotationa\\nl forces. CT features of PLC pathology are: When the PLC is definitely injured on CT, it can already be scored as 3. Since the integrity of the PLC depends mostly on ligamentous str\\nuctures, MR is sometimes needed to adequately diagnose pathology of the PLC, especially when there is no dislocation or disruption on CT. MRI features of PLC pathology are: MRI has \\na tendency to overdiagnose PLC injury (4). In some cases it can be difficult to decide whether there is a burst fracture with a torn PLC or distraction with a torn PLC and a compres\\nsion fracture (figure). You have to decide what you think is the main issue: the collapse of the vertebral body or the distraction. Since in both cases the TLICS score based on imag\\ning will be high, there is usually an indication for surgical treatment. TLICS score In case of multiple fractures, you have to score each level separately. The level with the highe\\nst TLICS score usually will be decisive for the therapy of choice.\\nNeurological status:\\nThe third category is the neurological status as determined by the neurologist or spine surgeon. The role of the radiologist is to report the following: One of the key points here i\\ns that an incomplete cord lesion will likely benefit more from surgery than a complete lesion; therefore a complete cord injury is scored as only 2 points, while an incomplete cord \\ninjury gets 3 points.\\nModifiers:\\nModifiers are other factors which can affect the decision of appropriate treatment: Sternum fracture Sternum fracture The image shows a vertebral fracture with a transverse fracture\\n of the spinous process, but also a fracture of the sternum. Analogous to the 3-column classification of Denis, some investigators consider the sternum as the fourth column in upper\\n thoracic spinal fractures and recognize it as an independent variable in the assessment and treatment of these patients (5). Rigid spine Patients with a rigid spine (such as in ank\\nylosing spondylitis, DISH and rheumatoid arthritis) are more susceptible to spinal fractures, even after minimal trauma (6). Ossification of the spinal ligaments and calcification o\\nf the annulus fibrosus alter the biomechanics of the spine, creating long lever arms and limiting the ability to absorb even minor impacts. The bone is usually very osteoporotic. Th\\ne images are of a patient with a typical bamboo spine as a result of ankylosing spondylitis. After a fall on his back no fracture was seen on the x-rays. However the CT shows a thin\\n fracture line through the anterior side of the vertebral body and also through the spinous process. Continue with the MR-images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Look at the images. What are the findings? Then scroll to the next images. The findings are: The TLICS-score is high, because there is distraction and injury to the P\\nLC.\\nSimple compression:\\nA simple compression fracture is the most common form of injury and is seen in 90% of cases. It is either loss of height of the anterior part of the vertebral body or disruption of \\nthe vertebral endplate. The posterior cortex of the vertebral body has to be intact and this feature differentiates a simple compression fracture from the more severe burst fracture\\n. The posterior cortex may bulge slightly posteriorly in a simple compression fracture. As long as there is no free fragment with posterior displacement, it is a wedge compression f\\nracture and not a burst fracture. The images show a compression fracture. All we see is a cortical disruption in the upper anterior wall of the vertebral body and slight loss of hei\\nght ventrally. The posterior vertebral cortex is intact. The sagittal reformatted image also shows the cortical disruption. Notice that on a 2.5mm axial slice you can miss these fra\\nctures. You have to look at the thin slices to detect such a subtle fracture. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images. Notice the horizontal band of density, which is often described as sclerosis. This density does not mean that it involves an older fracture\\n that is already healing with sclerosis. This is merely a sign of trabecular impaction in an acute fracture. It is very common to see more fractures on imaging with CT and MRI than \\non the radiographs. In this case the CT shows 2 fractures and the MRI shows 3 fractures. Pitfalls in diagnosing a compression fracture are: The images show two cases of osteochondro\\nsis. On the right with kyphosis.\\nBurst fracture:\\nThis is the severe variant of a compression fracture with higher risk of neurologic deficits. The name is derived from the typical fracture following a fall from height and landing \\non the feet. A burst fracture gets 2 points for morphology in the TLICS. This means that a patient can be treated non-surgically. In the absence of a neurologic deficit, PLC integri\\nty should be confirmed at MR imaging, especially if conservative management of a burst fracture is planned (3). In the Denis classification a burst fracture is classified as a two-c\\nolumn injury, calling it unstable and requiring surgical stabilization. Subsequent modifications of the Denis classification have recognized that with an intact posterior ligamentou\\ns complex (PLC), two-column unstable injuries can be successfully treated non-surgically (3). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Retropulsion of posterosuperior vertebral body fragment Retropulsion of a fragment is the typical feature of a burst fracture and distinguishes it clearly from a simp\\nle compression fracture. Scroll through the images. Sagittal\\nfracture of vertebral body and\\nposterior element A sagittal fracture of the vertebral body and a sagittal posterior element fracture is seen in respectively 90% and 85% of cases of burst fracture cases. Here are \\nfour examples. In the Denis classification this would be a three column fracture -anterior/middle/posterior - indicating a very unstable fracture. In the TLICS classification howeve\\nr this is a burst fracture, i.e. 2 points for morphology. The treatment will depend on the PLC integrity and the neurological status. Widening of the interpedicular distance Widenin\\ng of the interpedicular distance, often a result of the sagittal fracture, is seen in 80% of burst fractures. The lateral view shows the typical features of a burst fracture. On the\\n AP-view notice the subtle widening of the interpedicular distance compared to the levels above and below. The axial CT and MRI in the same patient show the displaced fragment press\\ning on the thecal sac. On the sagittal CT and MRI there are no signs of posterior ligamentous injury. The anterior longitudinal ligament is disrupted. The right facet joint looks a \\nbit widened on the CT and there is some fluid in the joint on the MRI. If there was a lot of fluid in the joint, we should call this indeterminate. In this case we are not sure. Ena\\nble Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images.

              " Document(page_content=\"Translation - Rotation:\\nThis type of fracture includes all fractures that are the result of displacement in the horizontal plane: side-to-side motion, either left-to-right or anterior-to-posterior or side-\\nto-side rotary motion of one vertebral body with respect to another. Often unilateral or bilateral facet dislocation is seen in rotational fractures. It is a severe type of injury, \\nwhich always involves the PLC.

Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll On the axial images we see: These are typical findings in translation-rotation fractures. So we should call this a translation fracture with anterior displacement.\\nDistraction:\\nA distraction injury is separation or pulling apart of two adjacent vertebrae. It is a severe injury since there is a high chance of cord injury when its osseous and ligamentous sup\\nporting structures are pulled apart. A distraction injury on the posterior side can lead to a compression fracture on the anterior side. So be sure not to underestimate the injury b\\ny only looking at the compression fracture and overlooking the distraction injury. In some cases it is difficult to decide whether you are dealing with distraction combined with a c\\nompression fracture or with a compression fracture with PLC-injury. If the distraction is the main feature, then the morphology is distraction, i.e. 4 points. In these cases the PLC\\n is always involved, resulting in a total of 7 points for the TLICS-score. If compression is the main feature, then the morphology is burst, i.e. 2 points combined with the PLC inju\\nry making a total of 5 points. In both cases the patient is a surgical candidate.

There is n\\not much else happening here. The disc space is markedly widened about four times the normal level. The facet joints are separated on both sides. There is a spinous process fracture,\\n which is not a key element but a frequently associated injury. Continue with the MR. The MRI shows exactly the same things. Frequently when you have a good CT, you have most of the\\n anatomic information. The MRI also shows disruption of the ligamentum flavum and a partial disruption of the interspinous ligament. TLICS score: This patient is at high risk of dev\\neloping a spinal cord injury. Here a fracture that just looks like another compression fracture on the lateral view. At first glance the AP-view doesn't look very odd. That is until\\n we zoom in and look at the distance between the spinous processes. Now when you look carefully at the lateral view, you will notice that the facets are separated. The MRI tells us \\nthe whole story. You can see the edema related to the fracture of the vertebral body and the massive edema in the paraspinous muscles. There is major disruption of the PLC of both t\\nhe ligamenta flava and the interspinous ligament. TLICS: distraction injury + PLC disruption. This is an interesting case since non-surgical management was initially attempted in th\\nis patient. However when we classify according to the TLICS-score, we give 4 points for the morphology and 3 points for the PLC. Assuming the neurological exam was normal, this pati\\nent would still get 7 points. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, conservative management failed with near-dislocation. Finally a posterior spondylodesis was performed. Here's anot\\nher example. You could call these compression fractures. There is loss of height with a dense band of impaction and there is an anterosuperior corner fracture on both levels. But lo\\nok at the spinous processes. One of the spinous processes is in two pieces and the two pieces are widely separated. So this is a distraction fracture, also known as Chance fracture.\\n Now when you describe such a fracture the first word in your report should be distraction, i.e. morphology: 4 points. This next case has a great teaching point. There is widening b\\netween the spinous processes. But there are also little pieces ofbone, that have avulsed at least 10mm away. At first we thought that little pieces of bone didn't matter, but they m\\nay be the most important sign of a major injury on a CT-scan. The fact that these little pieces of bone have been so severely displaced means there has to be a major injury. Now in \\nthis case there are lots of other things going on, but sometimes these little pieces of bone are all you get. If you look back, see how nicely it correlates with the PLC-injury on t\\nhe MRI. The teaching point is: pay careful attention to little pieces of bone. Patients with a rigid spine are more at risk for translation or distraction. Here is a patient with di\\nstraction on the anterior side. Notice the rigid spine and how easily this major injury can be overlooked. This patient had a motorcycle accident. The MRI demonstrates rupture of th\\ne flava ligaments, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments as well as fracture of the posterior elements and compression of the vertebral body.

Press ctrl+ for larger images and text on a PC or ⌘+ on a Mac.\\nMost images can be enlarged by clicking on them.\\nLocalization of hemorrhage:\\nKnowing the location of a hemorrhage is often the key to the differential diagnosis especially in non-traumatic bleeding. Extra-axial hemorrhage -Intracranial extracerebral Intra-ax\\nial hemorrhage- intracerebral 85% of non-traumatic hemorrhages are seen in patients with hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). In hypertension the hemorrhages are typic\\nally in a central position in the basal ganglia, pons, thalamus and cerebellum, while in CAA they are typically more in a peripheral location - deep in the frontal, parietal or temp\\noral lobes - also called lobar hemorrhages. The differential diagnosis in a patient with an intracerebral hemorrhage however is much larger and also includes: Right lower image is v\\nenous infarction due to sinus thrombosis (yellow arrows)\\nLobar hemorrhage:\\nLobar hemorrhages are located in the periphery of the cerebral lobes unlike hypertensive bleeding which usually is located more centrally. The most common cause especially in elderl\\ny is cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but also hypertension because of its high prevalence. Other causes: Here some examples of lobar hemorrhages. Bleeding into the ventricular system i\\nn lobar hemorrhage is not as common as in hypertensive hemorrhage because of the more periferal location. Only when they are very large, they can cause bleeding into the ventricular\\n system (fig). This patient died the next day.\\nNo definitive diagnosis was made, but it was assumed that this was a case of CAA.\\nBasal ganglia:\\nHemorrhage in the basal ganglia is typically seen in hypertension.\\nHypertensive hemorrhage typically occurs in elderly patients and is usually in a central location.\\nThis differentiates hypertensive bleeding from hemorrhage in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) which are more peripheral in location, although overlap can occur. The i\\nmages show a typical hypertensive hemorrhage in the putamen, which is the largest and most lateral part of the basal ganglia.\\nContinue with the follow up images... On a follow up scan only parenchymal loss is seen in the putamen where the hemorrhage was located (arrow). The putamen is vascularized by the l\\nenticulostriate arteries (LSa). The LSa are small diameter end vessels that originate at a right angle from the artery of Charcot without the gradual stepdown in size that occurs in\\n the distal cortical vessels. Their internal pressure may be very high and for this reason the LSa are particularly susceptible to damage from hypertension, the formation of small a\\nneurysms and rupture (3) (ref). The first three images show a large hematoma in the basal ganglia on the right with massive edema. The follow up image one year later shows  linear c\\navitation due to tissue loss (arrow) and hypodensity of the basal ganglia as a result of  gliosis. Hemorrhage in the head of the caudate nucleus with extension into the ventricular \\nsystem Caudate nucleus The images show a hemorrhage in the basal ganglia in a patient with longstanding hypertension.\\nIt is located in the head of the caudate nucleus. The head of the caudate nucleus receives its blood supply from Heubner’s artery and the lenticulostriate arteries,.\\nA rupture in these arteries causes parenchymal hemorrhage. The presence of an intraventricular haematoma is considered a poor prognostic factor due to the obstruction to CSF with hy\\ndrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure.\\nThalamus:\\nBleeding in the thalamus is typically seen in hypertension.

The most common cause is trauma. Non-traumatic SAH is usually the result\\n of aneurysmal rupture with spread of blood into the subarchnoidal cisterns (fig). The first choice of imaging modality in a patient with a clinical suspicion of SAH is a non-enhanc\\ned CT scan (NECT).

The major symptoms are neurologic deficits, dementia and epilepsia.\\nThe epilepsia is caused by the hemosiderin deposits near the cortex of the brain. The major risk factor is increasing age. These small hemorrhages are also called microbleeds.\\nNotice how numerous these small hemorrhages are and primarily located in the perifery of the brain.\\nThis patient presented with a cerebellar hematoma. Continue with the T1W-image... The T1W-image shows a hyperintense hemorrhage (arrow). Hypertensive intracranial haemorrhage togeth\\ner with CAA make up 80% of the causes of intraparenchymal hematomas. \\nThink of CAA if you see multiple peripheral or lobar haemorrhages in an elderly patient.

Cortical superficial siderosis in CAA CAA-related bleeds include: In superfi\\ncial siderosis the proximity to the cortical surface appears to be the trigger for transient focal neurologic symptoms or amyloid spells. CAA patients with widespread cortical super\\nficial siderosis  have a far greater chance for recurrent hemorrhage compared to patients without cSS (ref).

Here we see an example of a subarachnoid haemorrhage o\\nn a NECT. Note the location of blood mainly around the brainstem and in the 3th and 4th ventricle. Often the location of subarachnoid blood helps to point in the direction of the an\\neurysm. The next step is performing a CT angiography, to search for an aneurysm as the cause of the SAH. This patient had a aneurysm at the origin of the left posterior inferior cer\\nebellar artery (PICA). Also note the hydrocefalus. This patient underwent a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and subsequent coiling. The DSA showed a saccular aneurysm of the l\\neft PICA of 6 mm in maximal diameter with a short, narrow neck. Saccular aneurysms are the most common type of aneurysm. They are round or lobulated and arise at bifurcations of the\\n Circel of Willis. They are multiple in 20%. In 5% they measure over 2,5 cm and are called “Giant aneurysms”. Other type of aneurysms are fusiform (extreme focal ectasia in atherosc\\nlerotic disease) and mycotic aneurysms. The latter are seen as peripheral located intraparenchymal clots with white matter oedema surrounding haemorrhage. They are caused by septic \\nemboli in patient with known bacteraemia.

It is centered anteriorly to the pons and midbrain but \\nmay extend in small amounts into the basal and suprasellar cisterns and even into the Sylvian and interhemispheric fissure. Perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage is a nonaneurys\\nmal form of SAH.\\nPatients with a perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage are not at risk for rebleeding in the initial years after the hemorrhage and have a normal life expectancy. \\nThe causes of PMSAH suggest a venous or capillary rupture at the level of the tentorial hiatus. The images show a slightly hyperdense focus in the prepontine and interpedunclair cys\\ntern in a patient who presented with acute severe headache.\\nDSA did not show an aneurysm. This patient complained of sudden onset headache with the sensation of a “burst” inside his head.\\nNeurological exam was normal, except for a stiff neck.

Here another example of a nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic SAH. Left image: NECT showed a small amount of subarachnoidal blood anterior to the brainstem. Right\\n image: more cranially, the pentagon, ambiens cistern and the proximal part of Sylvian’s fissures, did not show any blood. This is a typical presentation of nonaneurysmal perimesenc\\nephalic SAH.\\nThe blood is solely located around the brainstem. To diagnose a perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal SAH, the patient has to meet all the criteria in the table (8). If all these criteria\\n apply and the CTA does not show an aneurysm, you do not have to perform a DSA.\\nRole of CTA and DSA:\\nIn a SAH we usually will find an aneurysm with CTA.\\nIf the CTA does not show an aneurysm we usually continue with a DSA because it has a higher sensitivity. However if the CTA does not show an aneurysm and the clinical and CT-finding\\ns are compatible with a perimesenphalic hemorrhage, no further investigation is necessary (ref 8) Spontaneous peripherally located SAH a.k.a. “convexity SAH”\\nSpontaneous Convexity SAH:\\nCaseA 68 year old male presented with progressive tremor and weakness of right hand since one week. \\nThe differential diagnosis of the neurologists includes tumor or CVA.

When you scroll through the images, you will noti\\nce the thrombus in the right transverse sinus (arrowheads).\\nArteriovenous Malformation:\\nA cerebral AVM is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins resulting in arteriovenous shunting through abnormal vessels called the nidus. The vessels that make up the n\\nidus are fragile and can rupture, which results in hemorrhage. Most AVMs have a bleeding risk of 1-2% per year. The images are of a young female patient with sudden onset of headach\\ne several hours after the use of cocain.\\nShe presented with a left sided hemi paralysis. Spetzler-Martin classification The Spetzler-Martin arteriovenous malformation (AVM) grading system allocates points for various featu\\nres of intracranial arteriovenous malformations to give a grade between 1 and 5. \\nGrade 6 is used to describe inoperable lesions. \\nThe score correlates with operative outcome. eloquent brainsensorimotor, language, visual cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, brain stem, cerebellar nuclei, or regions immediately adjac\\nent to these structures non-eloquent brainfrontal lobe, temporal lobe, cerebellar hemispheres Click to enlarge image AVM 2 This patient presented with acute onset of severe headache\\n. Blood is seen in three different locations: Continue with the CTA... CTA shows a prominent PICA (yellow arrow)  with a 7 mm saccular aneurysm (circle) located adjacent to the verm\\nis. There is a dilated vein (blue arrow) which drains directly into the rectal sinus. In between the abnormal artery (PICA with aneurysm) and abnormal vein, a network of small vascu\\nlar structures is seen (arrowheads), suspected of a nidus. Continue with the DSA... DSA confirms the right PICA with aneurysm (arrow) which lead to a nidus (circle). The nidus was d\\nrained by either superficial and deep veins (not separately shown here). Findings are concordant with an AVM - Spetzler Martin 2: The saccular aneurysm originating from the PICA was\\n explained as a flow related aneurysm.\\nAs a result of the changed hemodynamics due to the AVM, the vessel wall can become weakened and form an aneurysm. The images show DSA before and after coiling of the aneurysm. \\nThe PICA, nidus and abnormal draining veins (together forming the AVM)  still show contrast enhancement.\\nIt was decided not to treat the AVM directly and to opt for follow-up and possibly operative exploration in the future. AVM 3 A 55 year old male presented with acute headache and a \\nconfused consciousness state. NCCT shows a lobar parenchymal hemorrhage surrounded by edema (left image). CTA only showed some dots of contrast (arrow) in the hemorrhage, connected \\nto small abnormal vessels (not shown) below the hemorrhage. No feeding arteries of draining veins were visible. The mass effect of the hemorrhage can obscure the underlying cause in\\n the acute phase. DSA and 3D images from the Right Internal Carotid artery showed an underlying AVM. Spetzler Martin 1 DSA control after surgical removal of the AVM shows no signs o\\nf residue. AVM 4 65 year old man complaining of acute onset of headache. NCCT shows bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage  and a parenchymal hemorrhage (yellow arrow). CTA show at the l\\nocation of the parenchymal hemorrhage a flow related aneurysm of the anterior communicans artery, which was considered the cause of the SAH. \\nNotice the hemorrhage next to the aneurysm (circle). CTA also showed an AVM with the nidus in the left frontal lobe (green arrow). In patients with an AVM flow dynamics may change i\\nn a way that the arterial walls become weakened and aneurysms may develop. Lateral view of the CTA: Left image: DSA of the aneurysm before treatment. Right image: DSA after treatmen\\nt with separately coiling of the aneurysm and daughter sac (yellow arrow). It was decided to treat the aneurysm first and remove the AVM surgically in the sub acute phase when the p\\natient has recovered from his subarachnoid hemorrhage.\\nDural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF):\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='A dural arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between a dural artery and a vein or venous sinus. \\nDue to the increased venous pressure a variety of symptoms may occur: pulsatile tinnitus, headache, raised intracranial pressure, epileptic seizures, venous infarction or intracereb\\nral hemorrhage. The presence of cortical venous reflux in patients with DAVF increases the chance of neurological deficits due to venous infarction or hemorrhage. In contrast to art\\neriovenous malformation, a DAVF is usually an acquired disorder and may develop after cerebral venous thrombosis. Although DAVFs may be visible on 3D time of flight MRA, or CT angio\\ngraphy, DSA is still the gold standard to diagnose and classify the type of DAVF. Treatment consists of endovascular embolization of surgical disconnection. dAVF 1 This patient suff\\nered from an intraventricular hemorrhage. Note the cortical venous reflux (arrowheads) on the CT-angiography with also venous ectasia (yellow arrow) near the temporal horn of the la\\nteral ventricle as the bleeding spot. The DSA images (lateral view) confirmed a dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) Borden type 3, Cognard type IV. Note the massive cortical venous r\\neflux with venous ectasia. Embolization with liquid agent (arrow) After trans-arterial embolization with liquid embolic agents (arrow), there was a complete obliteration of the DAVF\\n. dAVF 2 This patient had intermitted speech disturbances. MRI showed a lobar hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe. On the 3D TOFMRA there was arterialization of the vein of Labbé (\\narrow). dAVF 2 Note the massive venous congestion on the T1 with Gadolineum (arrow). Lateral view of a injection into the distal maxillary artery (left) and occipital artery (right)\\n. dAVF 2 Note the direct fistula in a subarachnoid vein with cortical venous reflux through the vein of Labbé (arrow). This is a Borden 3, Cognard type IV. This patient was treated \\nwith embolization through the occipital artery (histroacryl) and middle meningeal artery (Squid ®) with complete obliteration of the DAVF. The patient recovered completely.\\nCavernous malformation:\\nA cavernous malformation, also called cavernoma or cavernous hemangioma, is a vascular hamartoma.\\nIt is a benign mass composed of immature vessels. \\nCavernomas may be congenital, but usually form during life. Patient may be asymptomatic or present with intracranial haemorrhage. Patients of any age may present with a cavernoma. A\\n cavernous malformation is composed of immature vessels and may bleed. \\nImaging may depict various stages of bleeding. This example shows the typically appearance on MRI named “popcorn lesions”: a complete hemosiderin ring surrounding a heterogeneous le\\nsion. They are usually located supratentorial, but may less commonly present in the pons or cerebellum. The Zabramski classification has been proposed as a way of classifying cerebr\\nal cavernous malformations, and although not used in clinical practice it is useful in scientific publications that seek to study cavernous malformations. On non-enhanced CT caverno\\nmas are only seen when: Multiple cavernomas can be confused with multiple haemorrhagic metastasis. In the table some differences are listed.\\nInfarction with hemorrhagic transformation:\\nLobar hemorrhage in hemorrhagic infarction This patient came to the emergency department with a left-sided hemiplegia and dysarthria. These symptoms quickly diminished and when they\\n decided to dismiss the patient, the symptoms came back suddenly.\\nIt was diagnosed as an acute infarction in the area of the right middle cerebral artery.\\nThrombolytic therapy was started right away.\\nThe next day the patient got worse and the second CT-scan showed a large hemorrhagic infarction in the right acm area. The next day this patient died. This patient was submitted to \\nthe stroke unit with a recent infarct in the left MCA territory. \\nDue to delay in presentation outside the thrombolytic window, no thrombolytic therapy was given. A follow-up NECT (image A) was ordered because of clinically deterioration and showe\\nd a well demarcated hypodense area in the left MCA territory. In the hypodense area, very small subtle hyperdens foci were depicted. MRI several hours later the same day showed foci\\n of hemorrhage (arrow) indicating petechial hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic infarct.\\nHemorrhagic metastases:\\nThis cortically located location at the grey-white matter junction is typical of hematogenously metastatic spread. \\nThey usually follow flow-dynamics: 80% anterior circulation vs. 20% posterior. Metastasis can become so large, that when they bleed, they present as a focal lobar hemorrhage. 50% of\\n hemorrhagic metastases present as a solitary lesion and the other half presents as two or more lesions. The most common hemorrhagic metastases are:\\nHemorrhagic Brain tumor:\\nIntratumoral hemorrhage The glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumour to show intratumoral haemorrhage. In oligodendrogliomas haemorrhage occurs in 20%. An other co\\nmmon known acute presentation of intratumor haemorrhage is apoplexia due to bleeding in a hypophyseal macroadenoma. The CT-images show:\\nPituitary Apoplexia:\\nThis patient presented with sudden headache, nausea and vomiting. \\nHe had ptosis of his left eye. The images show a pituitary macroadenoma with extension into the cavernous sinus. \\nNote the subtle hyperdensities in the tumour (arrow). \\nOn a T1W non-enhanced image there is mild hyperintensity posteriorly and cranially in the tumor. These findings suggested intratumoral hemorrhage, which was confirmed at surgery. by\\n Sara Shams, MD et al. Cerebrovasc Dis. 2016\\n2.

Anatomy of the Infrahyoid Neck\\nAnatomy of the Infrahyoid Neck:\\nSurgical triangles:\\nThe infrahyoid neck is the region of the neck extending from the hyoid bone to the thoracic inlet. Traditionally the anatomy of the infrahyoid neck has been subdivided into a group \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 33}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"of surgical triangles whose borders are readily palpable bones and muscles (figure). These triangles have a cranial-caudal orientation and therefore are difficult to correlate with \\ncross-sectional imaging. Another approach to the anatomy of the neck is the so-called 'spatial approach', which we shall use in this review. Notice the musculus omohyoideus in the i\\nllustration. This is one of the 'strap' muscles, an important landmark in the neck. It is a group of four pairs of muscles in the anterior part of the neck: the sternothyroid, stern\\nohyoid, thyrohyoid and omohyoid muscles. They are all attached to the hyoid bone and look like a strap. The other strap-muscles are not drawn in this illustration. The infrahyoid ne\\nck is separated from the suprahyoid neck by the hyoid bone (arrow) In the spatial approach to the anatomy of the infrahyoid neck, the cross-sectional anatomy is described as a serie\\ns of spaces defined by the various layers of the deep cervical fascia. This facilitates the understanding and interpretation of cross-sectional imaging modalities like CT and MRI (1\\n). Some of these infrahyoid spaces are continuous with the suprahyoid neck and some are continuous with the superior mediastinum. Spaces defined by the deep cervical fascia\\nSpaces of the infrahyoid neck:\\nThe infrahyoid neck is divided into 5 major anatomical compartments or spaces by the various layers of the cervical fascia (2). These spaces are well recognized in the axial plane a\\nnd therefore suited for analysis on axial CT or MR. Central compartment containing several viscera like the larynx, thyroid, hypopharynx and cervical esophagus.\\n2. Carotid space Paired space just lateral to the visceral compartment which contains the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein and several neural structures.\\n3. Retropharyngeal space \\nA small virtual space containing only fat continuous with the suprahyoid space and the middle mediastinum.\\n4. Posterior Cervical Space \\nPaired space posterolateral to the carotid space. It contains fat, lymph nodes and neural elements.\\n5. Perivertebral space This large space completely encircles the vertebral body including the pre- and paravertebral muscles. On the left a CT image of a patient with massive subcut\\naneous emphysema after a motor vehicle accident. Air has dissected along the layers of the cervical fascia. Notice that you are able to find all five spaces - they are now outlined \\nby air.\\nSystematic approach:\\nThe systematic approach to pathology in the infrahyoid neck is a three-step procedure: In which space is the lesion located?\\n* Step 2: What are the normal contents of this space?\\n* Step 3: What pathology arises from these contents and can we recognize a specific radiological pattern and does this correspond to the clinical information?\\nVisceral space:\\nThe visceral space extends from the hyoid to the anterior mediastinum and does not extend into the suprahyoid space. On the left the normal contents and derived pathology of the vis\\nceral space. The CT section is at the level of the supraglottic larynx and the thyroid cartilage. Anterior to the thyroid cartilage are the 'strap' muscles: sternothyroid, sternohyo\\nid, thyrohyoid and omohyoid . They are all connected to the hyoid and depress the hyoid bone and larynx during swallowing and speaking. These muscles are long and flat much like a s\\ntrap. We will now continue with a few cases. Although we have provided the diagnosis in these cases, we still want you to follow the 3-step approach.\\nLaryngocele:\\nStep 1: which space On the left a patient with a swelling on the right side of the neck. Study the image and decide in which space the lesion is located. Then continue reading. The \\nswelling is centered within the borders of the thyroid cartilage. Therefore this must be pathology arising in the visceral space. Laryngocele (courtesy: Ilona Schmallfuss) Step 2: n\\normal contents On the left an additional image is shown at a slightly lower level. Study the images and decide which structures in the visceral space are present at this level and w\\nhich are not. Then continue reading. The CT section shows the lesion present at the level of the supraglottic larynx and the thyroid cartilage. So we are much too cranial for trache\\na, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands and recurrent laryngeal nerve, which lies in the tracheo-esophageal groove. Paratracheal Level VI lymph nodes are located around the larynx and \\nnot within the larynx, so they can be ruled out. The hypopharynx is posterior to the lesion and has a normal appearance. Embryological remnants like thyroglossal duct cyst can be co\\nnsidered, but these are typically embedded in the laryngeal strap musculature and therefore should be located anterior to the thyroid cartilage. So the only normal anatomy from whic\\nh this lesion could have arisen is the larynx. Step 3: Pattern recognition This lesion presents as a cystic lesion with sharply defined, enhancing boundaries. The lesion is located \\nin the supraglottic larynx in the right paraglottic space and also has an extralaryngeal component, which explains the lump on the right side of the neck. At endoscopy a large submu\\ncosal swelling on the right was seen in the larynx. Squamous cell cancer, which is a mucosal disease, can therefore be dismissed. When we think about the radiological appearance of \\nthe four submucosal entities mentioned in the table on the left, we can make the following remarks: Secondary internal and external laryngocele caused by a tumor at the level of the\\n laryngeal ventricle ( enhancing mass on the right image) Laryngocele (2) When a larynocele is suspected you always have to search carefully for an underlying cause. Primary laryngo\\ncele has no underlying cause. \\nSecondary laryngocele arises due to pathology in the laryngeal ventricle, which is a slit-like opening between the true and the false vocal cords. A secondary laryngocele is frequen\\ntly caused by a squamous cell carcinoma, as in this case. At endoscopy the tumor may be obscured by the laryngocele itself. LEFT: Coronal CT image through the larynx with normal ana\\ntomy: false cords (F), true cords (T) and ventricle in between (V) RIGHT:Fluid-filled secondary internal and external laryngocele due to a small enhancing tumor in the laryngeal ven\\ntricle (T) obstructing the laryngeal ventricle. On the left side, an air-filled primary internal and external laryngocele. Mechanism of a laryngocele The laryngeal ventricle (v) is \\na slit-like opening between the false and true vocal cords (image far left). It is the anatomic landmark between supraglottis and glottis. The ventricle extends laterally and then c\\nranially into the paraglottic space. When the opening of the laryngeal ventricle is completely obstructed by tumor, the mucosa in the paraglottic space continues to produce fluid. T\\nhis results in a fluid-filled internal laryngocele. Eventually the paraglottic space becomes filled up and the internal laryngocele will become external by extending outside of the \\nlarynx through the thyro-hyoid membrane. When the opening of the laryngeal ventricle is partially obstructed, a pressure-valve mechanism may result in an air-containing internal lar\\nyngocele which may, eventually, become external (right image, red arrow).\\nSquamous cell carcinoma:\\nOn the left, a CT-image at the level of the thyroid cartilage. There is an irregular mass centered in the right piriform sinus. This mass is in the visceral space. In this region th\\ne most common tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma. This was proven at biopsy. Notice the retropharyngeal space (yellow arrow). This is a virtual space containing only some fat. Squam\\nous cell carcinoma (2) On the left, contiguous slices in a craniocaudal direction at the level of the larynx. Study this case, which is quite similar to a previously discussed case \\nand then continue reading. Multinodular goiter Strap muscles on right side (yellow arrow) and presumed position of strap muscles on the left (blue arrow)\\nMultinodular goiter:\\nStep 1: Which space On the left a patient with a swelling on the left side of the neck, which has existed for years. The swelling is adjacent to the left lamina of the thyroid carti\\nlage. The strap musculature seems to be draped over the lesion (blue arrow). Therefore this lesion lies within the visceral space. Step 2: Normal contents Analysis of the normal ana\\ntomical contents of the visceral space rules out many possible tissues and organs from which this pathology may arise: This mass is located outside of the larynx and hypopharynx. Th\\ne hypopharynx is slightly displaced due to the retropharyngeal extension of the mass and the lesion lies cranial to the trachea.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"* Embryological remnants \\nRemnants like thyroglossal duct cyst can be considered but these lesions are usually cystic.\\n* Paratracheal lymph nodes \\nThese are located outside of the strap musculature.\\n* Recurrent laryngeal nerve \\nThis nerve is located within the tracheo-esophageal groove. By exclusion we can say that this mass arises either from the thyroid gland or the parathyroid glands. Multinodular goite\\nr with intrathoracic extention Step 3: Pattern recognition and clinical information On the chest film we notice a displacement of the trachea to the right by an upper mediastinal ma\\nss. So the mass is located within the visceral space and extends into the anterior mediastinum, since the trachea is located within the anterior mediastinum. It is well-defined towa\\nrds the surrounding fat and there are a few scattered coarse calcifications. When we combine these findings, we recognize the radiological pattern of a benign multinodular goiter. T\\nhis diagnosis is compatible with the clinical information that the swelling in the neck has been present for years. Thyroglossal duct cyst: axial T1- and T2-weighted images at the l\\nevel of the hyoid bone\\nThyroglossal duct cyst:\\nOn the left axial T1- and T2-weighted images at the level of the hyoid bone. There was no enhancement on the post Gadolinium study (not shown) It is a midline cystic lesion, party e\\nxternal and partly internal to the hyoid bone and located in the visceral space. The lesion is embedded in the strap musculature. It is unlikely that this lesion arises from the tra\\nchea, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands or recurrent laryngeal nerve, since these structures are located more caudally. Lymph nodes are usually seen in the subcutaneous fat around t\\nhe larynx. By exclusion a thyroglossal duct cyst is the most likely diagnosis. Thyroglossal duct cyst (2) Key facts Paramedian thyroglossal duct cyst On the left an example of a par\\namedian thyroglossal duct cyst. This lesion not in the midline, but the key finding is that this lesion is cystic and embedded in the strap musculature. Paramedian thyroglossal duct\\n cyst Thyroglossal duct cyst (3) When the diagnosis thyroglossal duct cyst is made, always check if there is a thyroid in the normal position. The thyroid anlage may never travel al\\nong the thyroglossal duct. In that case it stays at the tongue base. In these rare cases, the patient has a so-called lingual thyroid. On the left another paramedian thyroglossal du\\nct cyst Lingual thyroid (courtesy: Tony Hasso) On the left, a child with a lingual thyroid. This is the only functioning thyroid tissue that this child has. It would be a disaster i\\nf such a 'lesion' were to be excised. On the left images of a three-year old girl with a slowly enlarging tumor in the midline. On ultrasound a hypoechoic ovoid smooth bordered lesi\\non is seen at the level of the hyoid bone and slightly right off midline (left image). During US examination, the lesion moves simultaneously with extrusion of the tongue. Cystic na\\nture and close relation to the hyoid bone makes thyroglossal duct cyst the most likely diagnosis. Notice that a normal thyroid gland is present (right image).\\nCarotid space:\\nThe carotid space extends from the skull base to the aortic arch. It transverses the suprahyoid and infrahyoid neck into the anterior mediastinum. On the left the normal contents of\\n the carotid space and the derived pathology. Paraganglioma: T1-weighted Gadolineum enhanced MR image at the level of the supraglottic larynx\\nParaganglioma:\\nStep 1: Which space On the left a patient with a swelling on the left side of the neck. Study the MR-image at the level of the supraglottic larynx and decide in which space the lesi\\non is located. Then continue reading. The swelling is centered between the external and internal carotid artery. Notice that these vessels are compressed. Evidently this lesion must\\n be located in the carotid space. Please note that there is a smaller, but identical, lesion present, located in the right carotid space. Step 2: Normal contents Now we must try to \\nfigure out the normal anatomical source that has caused this pathology.\\nOnce again, we use exclusion: As the name implies, these lesions are cystic.\\n* Neural structures in the carotid space like the vagus nerve and sympathetic plexus are located between the great vessels. Therefore it is very likely that the bilateral swellings \\nof this patient are coming from these neural structures. Now we are down to a fairly limited and space-specific differential diagnosis (see next image). The only exception to this r\\nule is in patients with neurofibromatosis. Unlike this lesion, schwannomas and neurofibromas occur unilaterally. Although they enhance on MR, flow voids are usually absent.\\n* Paragangliomas are frequently multiple in 3% to 5% of patients overall and 20% to 30% with a positive family history. These lesions show intense enhancement on CT and MR as seen o\\nn this coronal post-Gadolinium MR-image. In the larger lesion on the left, typical flow voids are present (see also axial image). So we can conclude that there are bilateral intense\\nly enhancing lesions with flow voids in the carotid space, most likely carotid body tumors or paragangliomas. Paraganglioma: Ultrasound with color doppler, T1-weighted non-contrast \\nMR and CECT Paraganglioma (2) On the left images of a 21-year old female with a mass on the right. This lesion is located between the internal and external carotid artery and theref\\nore is a neural tumor. The differential diagnosis is limited to tumors arising from the vagus nerve and sympathetic plexus. On CT and color doppler the mass is clearly hypervascular\\n and the only possible diagnosis is a paraganglioma. Paraganglioma (3) Key facts Schwannoma: axial T2-weighted image and angiogram\\nSchwannoma:\\nOn the left images of a 28-year old female with a nontender mass at the left mandibular angle. Step 1\\nThe mass is located in carotid space. Step 2 Anatomical contents: carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, sympathetic plexus, lymph nodes (Level 2-4) and congenital remn\\nants of the 2nd branchial cleft . Step 3 Therefore it is very likely that this mass has a neural origin: They do enhance, but are not particularly hypervascular. Flow voids are usua\\nlly absent. It is not possible to discriminate between these two possibilities based on their radiological appearance. Thrombosis of jugular vein\\nJugular vein thrombosis:\\nThrombosis of the internal jugular vein is an under-diagnosed condition that may occur as a complication of head and neck infections, surgery, central venous access, and intravenous\\n drug abuse. An infected jugular vein thrombus caused by extension of an oropharyngeal infection is referred to as Lemierre's syndrome. This is a bacterial infection that may have s\\nevere morbidity or even fatal outcome, as eventually septic emboli may spread to the lungs. On the left a patient who had undergone a total laryngectomy several years previously. Th\\ne present complaint is a painful swelling on the left side of the neck since one day. Step 1 Contrast-enhanced CT at mid-neck level shows the neopharynx with some surgical clips on \\nthe left and the enhancing right thyroid lobe which is still in situ. In addition there is a round, hypodense lesion in the left carotid space. Thrombosis of the left internal jugul\\nar vein Step 2 In this case, analysis of the normal anatomical contents of the carotid space can be short. When we compare left to right it is clear that we are dealing with an inte\\nrnal jugular vein which is enlarged and does not enhance. An image at a higher level shows the same appearance of the internal jugular vein (arrow). Step 3 In combination with the c\\nlinical information of a painful swelling on the left side of the neck, there is only one possible diagnosis: Acute thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein. Lemierre' s syndrom\\ne Lemierre' s syndrome When you diagnose an acute thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, always look for pulmonary symptoms, i.e. Lemierre' s syndrome. The oral infection spreads \\ninto the neck and causes internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis with subsequent septic emboli. Secondary infected branchial cleft cyst (courtesy Berit Verbist)\\nSecond branchial cleft cyst:\\nOn the left images of a 36-year old female with a progressive swelling on the left side of the neck.

It is superficial to the carotid artery and ju\\ngular vein (arrow). The cyst contents is hypoechoic with freely moving debris. Second branchial cleft cyst The MR of the same patient confirms the presence of a cystic mass in the r\\night carotid space. The lesion is situated between the submandibular gland and the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which is the classic position of a second branc\\nhial cleft cyst. The lesion shows edge enhancement post-Gadolinium. Notice that these lesions may contain small amounts of lymphoid tissue which is a possible explanation for the sm\\nall area of enhancement inside the cyst wall (arrow). Second branchial cleft cyst: high signal intensity on STIR Coronal STIR image of the same cyst.\\nRetropharyngeal Space:\\nRetropharyngeal space The retropharyngeal space extends superiorly to the base of the skull and inferiorly to the posterior mediastinum at the level of the tracheal bifurcation. In \\nnormal circumstances, the retropharyngeal space is a virtual space and contains the retropharyngeal lymph nodes superiorly as well as some fatty tissue. Infections of the mouth can \\nspread through this space into the posterior mediastinum. There are two other spaces in close proximity to the retropharyngeal space: the danger space and the prevertebral space. Th\\ney are often confused with the retropharyngeal space. The danger space actually lies between the alar fascia, which forms the posterior border of the retropharyngeal space, and the \\nprevertebral fascia. It extends from the cranial base above to the level of the diaphragm. The prevertebral space is bounded anteriorly by the prevertebral fascia and posteriorly by\\n the longus colli muscles of the spine. It extends down the mediastinum and continues to the insertion of the psoas muscles. All we need to realize is that pathology in this region \\ncan extend into the posterior mediastinum and we should not stop imaging until the tracheal bifurcation is reached.\\nRetropharyngeal abscess:\\nOn the left an axial contrast enhanced CT-image of an infant with fever. The child cannot swallow. This pathology is located in the retropharyngeal space. The prevertebral muscles a\\nre pushed towards the vertebral body. If this were a lesion located in the perivertebral space, these muscles would be pushed anteriorly. The retropharyngeal space is expanded and c\\nontains multiple pockets of material with fluid density. Obviously this is a retropharyngeal infection with multiple abscesses. This is an emergency situation because the abscesses \\nwill expand and may eventually obstruct the airways. Usually these deep abscesses require surgical drainage. On the left an adult patient with a retropharyngeal abscess after surgic\\nal drainage. The drainage catheters run from left to right through the retropharyngeal space. The retropharyngeal space can become infected in two ways. The 'classic' retropharyngea\\nl abscess observed in pediatric patients occurs when an upper respiratory infection like pharyngitis or adenoiditis spreads to retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Penetrating trauma, i.e. \\nforeign bodies, fish bones or iatrogenic causes such as endoscopy or intubation, can also be involved in retropharyngeal space infection.\\nRetropharyngeal edema:\\nOn the left two images of a patient with a piriform sinus carcinoma (shown earlier). On the far left the pirifrom sinus tumor before radiotherapy. The image next to it shows complet\\ne response after the radiotherapy. The retropharyngeal space is now distended and shows increased density of the fatty tissue due to post-radiotherapy edema.\\nPosterior cervical space:\\nOn the left a table with the normal contents of the posterior cervical space and subsequent pathology. MPNST is short for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, which is the prope\\nr name for a malignant schwannoma.\\nLymphoma:\\nStep 1: Which space On the left a patient with bilateral swelling in the neck. CT image at the level of the hyoid bone shows multiple rounded lesions medial to the sternocleidomasto\\nid muscles and dorsal to the internal jugular veins. These bilateral multiple lesions are located in the posterior cervical space.

These are confluent cystic low-density lesions. Step 3 By exclusion we can conclude that \\nthese are bilaterally enlarged lymph nodes with homogeneous enhancement. Homogeneous enhancement is typical for lymphoma. Central necrosis is more typical for squamous cell carcinom\\na metastases. Lymph node biopsy in this patient revealed B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphoma (2) On the left images of a 67-year old woman who had a history of Non-Hodgkin lymphom\\na. She had recently noticed a swelling on the left side of the neck. Step 1 CT image at the level of the true vocal cords shows a mass, which is clearly located in the posterior cer\\nvical space. Step 2 The mass is well-defined and isodense to muscle. Coronal reformation shows the mass to be elongated and extending towards the axilla following rhe course of the \\ncervico-brachial plexus.. Continue with the MR images. Recurrent NHL with diffuse infiltration of the left brachial plexus The lesion originates at the left neural foramina and grow\\ns along the course of the brachial plexus (red arrow). In fact, we are looking at a grossly thickened plexus. Step 3 The radiological pattern confirms the neurogenic origin of the m\\nass. Combined with the history the final diagnosis is diffuse infiltration of the left brachial plexus by recurrent NHL.\\nLipoma:\\nOn the left images of a patient with a swelling posteriorly on the left side of the neck.

Analysis of the normal anatomical components of the posterior cervical space can be short in this case. The mass has the signal intensity of fat on a T1-weighted image and the \\nsignal is completely suppressed with fat suppression. There was no enhancement (not shown), so we can conclude that this is a lipoma.

It provides objective criteria to determine whether a tumor disappears, shrinks, s\\ntays the same or gets bigger. \\nThis is called complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). In this article we describe the five easy steps to follow when you wa\\nnt to use RECIST 1.1. Recist 1.1 is not used for lymphoma, GIST during Glivec therapy, HCC and malignant brain tumors. \\nOther criteria have been published for these tumors.\\nIn addition a brief overview is given of variations of RECIST and some other response systems.\\nIntroduction:\\nRECIST is a standard way to measure the response of a tumor to treatment. If a study is eligible, choose target lesions (max 5) that are easy to measure and calculate the sum of the\\n longest diameters (SLD).\\nIdentify non-target lesions like ascites or pleural fluid that are not suited for exact measurements, but that can be followed. In the follow up study compare these lesions and dete\\nrmine the response.\\nBaseline Study - five easy steps:\\n1. Is the study eligible for RECIST?:\\nRadiographic studies that may be used: Ultrasound is not used for RECIST due to operator dependency.\\n2. Choose “target lesions”:\\nTumors\\nChoose preferably large well-described lesions to measure with a maximum of two per organ and a maximum of five for the whole study. Lymph nodes\\nLymph nodes can be used as target lesions provided that the maximum short axis diameter exceeds 15 mm.\\nNodes <10 mm are regarded as normal, while nodes 10-15mm are regarded as pathologic, but not suited for target lesions. They can be used as non-target lesions. Not target lesions Me\\nasurement includes hypervascular rim When a lesion has a hypervascular rim, this is included in measuring the longest diameter, because it represent viable tumor tissue. The CT imag\\nes in the arterial and portovenous phase of a 71-year-old male show liver metastases of a neuro-endocrine tumour of the esophagus.\\nNote that the hypervascular rim is better appreciated in the arterial phase.\\nThe large hypervascular rim is included in the measurement of the largest diameter. Measurements of the tumour thickness perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum in two positi\\nons at three different levels. Mesothelioma An exception to measuring the longest diameter is in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. \\nThe non-spherical growth pattern in this disease makes reproducible long axis measurements difficult.\\nTherefore not the longest diameter, but the tumour thickness perpendicular to the chest wall is used. \\nThis measurement has a good correlation with outcome. CT images in a 63-year-old male with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Measurements according to the modified RECIST 1.1 for mali\\ngnant pleural mesothelioma with measurement of the tumour thickness perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum in two positions at three different levels, preferably in the uppe\\nr thorax. Non-measurable lesions Example of non-measurable lesions in a patient with lymphangitis carcinomatosa and another patient with ascites. These findings are used as non-targ\\net lesions and in the follow up their presence or absence are determined. Left: non-measurable metastasis. Right: measurable metastasis. Bone metastases During follow-up bone metast\\nases quite often change in appearance while the size remains the same, therefore they are generally considered non-measurable lesions. According to RECIST 1.1. only lytic or mixed l\\nytic-blastic bone metastases with identifiable soft tissue component can be considered as measurable lesions if they meet the measurability criteria. The left CT image is of a 80-ye\\nar-old male with osteoblastic bone metastases of a non-small-cell lung carcinoma.\\nThis lesion is not suitable for measurement. The CT image on the right is of a 69-year-old female with an osteolytic metastasis in the right iliac bone.  \\nThis metastasis is suitable for measurement and can be used as target lesion. Sometimes the largest lesion is not the most suitable for reproducible repeated measurements.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 37}),\n",

Calculate Sum of Longest Diameters:\\nHere an example of 5 target lesions in a 28-year-old male with a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the appendix with liver, lymphogenic and peritoneal metastases. Non-target lesions: mili\\nary lung metastases of ovarian cancer.\\n4. Identify non-target lesions:\\nWhat are “non-target” lesions”?Non-target lesions are all other disease related lesions that do not meet the criteria for a target lesion like pleural fluid, ascites and miliary lun\\ng metastases, or those lesions that are supernumerary because the maximum number of 5 target lesions had been reached. You do not measure these lesions. Just mention them in the rep\\nort and in the follow up look for their presence or absence. The CT image with maximum intensity projection of a 34-year-old female with miliary lung metastases of ovarian cancer. T\\nhe metastases cannot be used as target lesions because they are too small. They can be used as non-target lesions and can be mentioned as a single item in the radiology report.\\n5. Report:\\nThe baseline radiology reportshould contain the following elements:\\nFollow up study:\\nIs the study technically comparable to previous?:\\nFor follow-up studies, the same imaging modality should be used as for the baseline study and identical imaging parameters should be used, like slice-thickness, contrast protocol et\\nc. In this case if the same orientation is used in the follow up, the measurement would be too small.\\nIdentify same target lesions:\\nOrientationIf the orientation of longest diameter varies during follow-up, measure the longest diameter (fig). Do's forcing overall response to progressive disease.\\n* Do measure the short axis of mesothelioma. Dont's Fragmentation\\nIf the lesion breaks into separate fragments between baseline and follow-up, the sum of longest diameters (SLD) of the fragments should be calculated. Vice versa if lesions coalesce\\n, then measure the longest diameter of the merged lesion only. Obviously, the short axis diameter is measured in lymph nodes. Too small to measure If a target lesion has disappeared\\n record a measurement of 0 mm.\\nIf the lesion is too small to measure assign a default value of 5 mm to prevent false responses (derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness). The images are of a patient with a primar\\ny lung tumour.\\nAt baseline, the longest diameter is well above 10 mm, therefore this was assigned as a target lesion. \\nDuring follow-up the long-axis diameter dropped below 10 mm, which is the lower limit for considering a lesion as target lesion. \\nHowever, since this is a follow-up measurement, the target lesion still counts up to the sum of the diameters (SLD) and a default value of 5mm was assigned. Cavitating lesions\\nCavitation can occur during treatment.\\nCavitating lesions should be continuously measured in their longest diameter. \\nA different assessment can be provided if the sum of diameters does not adequately correspond to the patients response assessment. These CT images are of a 32-year-old male with a p\\nulmonary metastasis of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour. \\nCavitation occured after treatment with pazopanib, but the size remained the same. Although the size remains the same, a remark can be made in the report, that the actual tumorvolum\\ne has decreased. Lymph node target lesion 18mm at baseline (left). At follow up only 4mm.\\nCalculate SLD:\\nIf during follow-up the short-axis diameter of a lymph node drops below 15 mm, the measurements are continued and still count for calculation of the SLD. In this case the baseline s\\nhort axis diameter is 18 mm. \\nThis was a target lesion. At follow-up, the short-axis diameter dropped below 15 mm. However, the measurements are continued, and the 4 mm diameter counts up for the SLD. When lymph\\n nodes decrease to a normal size (<10 mm), they still have to be included in the sum of the target lesions.\\nThis means that whenever the lymph nodes enlarge again, you will not overstate the progression, but also that complete remission is possible even when the sum of the diameters is no\\nt zero.\\nProgression of non-target lesions:\\nCT images in a 61-year-old male with melanoma during treatment. At baseline the inguinal lymph nodes were to small to be used as target lesions and were regarded as non-target lesio\\nns. At follow up there is unequivocal progression of the lymphogenic metastases. CT images in a 61-year-old male with unequivocal progression of non-target lymphogenic metastases of\\n melanoma during treatment. CT images in a 73-year-old male with progressive liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. \\nThis is anothe example of progression of non-target lesions. Even if there is partial response or even disappearance of other lesions, this is still progressive disease. New lesions\\n means progressive disease\\nNew lesions:\\nAny new lesion means progressive disease.

Any new lesion means progressive disease, but not every\\n newly detected lesion is always a true new lesion. In osteolytic bone metastases it can be difficult to determine if a sclerotic lesion that is detecting during follow up is truly \\na new lesion. The CT images are of a 50-year-old female with bone metastases of a breast carcinoma. \\nAt baseline (a), there is an osteolytic lesion in a thoracic vertebral body (arrow).\\nAfter chemotherapy, the thoracic osseous lesion has not changed in size, but has become completely osteoblastic (arrow in b), representing a good response. In the lumbar vertebra no\\n visible metastases were seen in the baseline scan (c). \\nThe ‘new’ sclerotic lesions in the lumbar vertebra (arrowheads in d), are considered to be small osteolytic metastases that the baseline CT failed to identify. \\nThey became visible due to the osteoblastic reaction.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 38}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='PET:\\nFDG-PET can be complementary to diagnostic CT imaging in assessment of disease progression, especially in the case of a possible new lesion. \\nA positive FDG-PET at follow-up, with a negative FDG-PET at baseline, is a sign of progressive disease based on the new lesion.\\nWithout an FDG-PET examination at baseline, findings are dependent on current and previous CT findings. CT images in a 72-year-old male with recurrent esophageal carcinoma and a re-\\nappearing lung metastasis.\\nReappearance of lesions:\\nDisappearance and subsequent reappearance of a lesion in follow-up examinations should continue to be measured.\\nDepending on the disease status, a reappearing lesion can be considered either progressive disease, when the previous examination showed complete response or otherwise the maximal d\\niameter should be added to the SLD for a calculated response. The rationale is that most lesions do not disappear but are under the detection level of the employed imaging modality.\\nResponse categories:\\nTo determine the response of a tumor in the follow up, we have to look at the target- and non-target lesions and look for any new lesions. Progressive Disease (PD) Stable Disease (S\\nD) Partial Response (PR) Complete Response (CR) *Nadir is the smallest sum of diameters (SLD) during treatment.\\nResponse in target lesions with or without non-target disease:\\nThe overall response is based on the response of all tumor related findings (table). For instance any progression ( >20% increase) of target or non-target lesions or any new lesion \\nmeans progressive disease no matter how the other lesions reacted. When tumor markers are initially elevated, they must normalize before considering complete response when all lesio\\nns have disappeared.\\nResponse in only non-target lesions:\\nIn some patients there are no suitable target lesions that can be measured and there are only non-target lesions.\\nIn these cases you have to make an estimation of the response (table).\\nRadiology report:\\nThe radiology report of each follow-up study should contain the following elements: ReportModality and parameters\\nDescription of target lesions with localization, table position and    size\\nDescription of non-target lesions and comparison: unchanged, decreased or increased in size.\\nNew lesions?\\nIncidental relevant findings Conclusion\\nNumber of target lesions and their localization, overall impression of non-target lesions, clinically important incidental findings. The table shows an example of a follow up report\\n. Calculation of SLD and assigning response categories by the radiologist depend on local agreement with the oncologist.\\nQuite commonly, only measurements of target disease and presence and extent of non-target disease are reported with an impression of the overall tumor response mentioned in the repo\\nrt’s conclusion.\\nOther Response systems:\\nChoi criteria for GIST:\\nThe Choi criteria are based on RECIST and developed for The Choi criteria are based on RECIST and developed for assessing treatment response in patients with gastrointestinal stroma\\nl tumors (GIST) treated with imatinib (3). Usually decrease in tumour size occurs in the course of treatment, however this doesn’t necessarily reflect tumour response. Sometimes tum\\nour size can increase due to internal hemorrhage, necrosis or myxoid degeneration. Major difference of Choi response criteria in comparison to RECIST 1.1 is the introduction of tumo\\nur attenuation as an additional response parameter. Reduction in tumor size is usually minimal in the early posttreatment response assessment, while significant changes in internal \\ncharacteristics like tumour attenuation, nodularity, and number of vessels will occur. The CT images of a 82-year-old male show liver metastases of a GIST at baseline (arrowheads). \\nAll metastases decrease somewhat in size after treatment with imatinib, but the most remarkable difference is a decrease in density.\\nThis is considered to be a good response according to the Choi criteria. Before the introduction of the Choi response criteria, recurrent or progressive disease used to be determine\\nd by an increase in tumour size or identification of new locations of disease.\\nAlthough increase in tumour size remains an important parameter for evaluating disease response, recurrent disease can occur within the treated tumor without increasing tumor size. \\nThe CT images in a 66-year-old male show liver metastases of a GIST at diagnosis (a).\\nAt 3 months after treatment with imatinib there is a good response (b).\\nAt a follow up scan at 1 year there is a  recurrence (arrow in c).\\nAt a  follow-up after 2nd line treatment with sunitinib there is still tumor progression, but the size remains the same (d).\\nmRECIST for Hepatocellular carcinomas:\\nTumour response assessment based on changes in size alone can be deceptive when applied to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with targeted or interventional therapies. In 2000 \\nthe European Association for the Study of the liver (EASL) assembled an expert panel on HCC which suggested that the optimal method for treatment response assessment in HCC should b\\ne the estimation of viable tumour with contrast enhanced imaging. These new criteria were based on RECIST 1.1 and referred to as modified RECIST (mRECIST) with the most important fe\\nature of defining viable tumour as uptake of contrast agent during arterial phase dynamic imaging on CT or MRI. mRECIST is only used for typical lesions showing intratumoral arteria\\nl enhancement, while RECIST 1.1 is applied for atypical enhancing lesions and extrahepatic disease. The table shows extra recommendations for the assessment of tumor response in non\\n-target lesions in patients with HCC and cirrhosis. Measurement rules in assessing response: Rules of progression: The CT image of the liver of a 96-year-old male with HCC in the la\\nte arterial phase shows a hypervascular tumour in the right liver lobe (arrowheads).\\nThe tumor is well delineated from the surrounding parenchyma.\\nIn the portal-venous phase the HCC is hardly distinguishable from the liver parenchyma due to early washout of contrast. This HCC is suitable for mRECIST.\\niRECIST for immune therapy:\\niRECIST represents a modified RECIST 1.1 for immune-based therapeutics. The immunotherapeutic agents induce a different tumour response in comparison to standard chemotherapeutic ag\\nents. The new mechanism of actions of these drugs, with immune and T-cell activation, can cause uncommon patterns of tumour response that look like tumour flare, termed pseudoprogre\\nssion (4). \\nPseudoprogression has been described in non-small cell lung carcinoma, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. These patients meet the criteria for disease progression according to tradi\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",

The main criteria to objectively evaluate tumour response are mostly unchanged from RECIST 1.1.\\n \\nThe most important change is to identify true disease progression, which is defined as subsequent increase in tumour burden after an examination with unconfirmed progressive disease\\n. *LDi = longest diameter, **SPD = the sum of the product of perpendicular diameters for multiple lesions\\nLugano Classification of malignant lymphoma:\\nThe Lugano classification incorporates PET-CT for initial evaluation, staging and response assessment of malignant lymphoma. Contrast enhanced CT is used for staging low FDG-avid ly\\nmphomas or for more accurate measurements of nodal size in clinical trials, to discriminate between bowel and lymphadenopathy, assessing compression or thrombosis of vessels and for\\n radiation planning. Measurable nodes must have a longest diameter (LDi) greater than 1.5 cm and measurable extranodal lesions must have a LDi greater than 1.0 cm. Bi-dimensional me\\nasurement of perpendicular diameters are noted for calculating the product of perpendicular diameters (PPD) and the sum of the product of perpendicular diameters for multiple lesion\\ns (SPD). Non-target disease includes the remaining measurable lesions (nodal and extranodal), spleen (> 13 cm vertical length) and non-measurable lesions (eg, smaller lesions, pleur\\nal and pericardial effusion, ascites). Modified Ann Arbor staging system Both Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma are staged according to a modified Ann Arbor classification. This stag\\ning system is based on the anatomical extent of disease and is divided into stages I-IV (see table). Patients with HL are subdivided according to the absence (A) or presence (B) of \\ndisease related symptoms (so called B symptoms), because this can influence the choice of therapy. Bulky disease can be a negative prognostic factor for some lymphomas. For HL it is\\n defined as a single nodal mass ≥ 10 cm or > 1/3 transthoracic diameter at any level of thoracic vertebrae on CT. For NHL this definition is not unambiguously, a variety of sizes ha\\nve been suggested for different subtypes.. Therefore, the recommendation for HL and NHL is to record the longest measurement on CT scan. CT image in a 28-year-old female with Hodgki\\nn lymphoma stadium II ‘bulky’.

CT images in a 56-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) before (a) and after (b) treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Coronal reconstructed CT images in the same\\n patient show hepatosplenomegaly before (a) and normalization of hepatic and splenic size after (b) treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Splenomegaly is defined as a vertical length \\n>13 cm. \\nHepatic size is not a reliable measure of hepatic involvement by lymphoma.\\nResponse assessment:\\nFor response assessment the SPD after treatment is compared to the SPD at baseline. \\nFour response assessment categories are determined; complete remission (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) (table). To achieve CR no findin\\ngs of lymphoma should be present, and all target nodes should have a LDi ≤ 1.5 cm. For PR the SPD of up to 6 target lesions should decrease ≥ 50%, there should be no increase in non\\n-measured lesions and splenic size should be regressed > 50% in length beyond normal. SD is defined as < 50% decrease from baseline SPD of up to 6 target lesions. \\nTo meet the criteria for PD just a single target lesion should increase ≥ 50% in product of perpendicular diameters (PPD) from nadir (smallest PPD during treatment), splenomegaly pr\\nogresses or occurs, clear progression of pre-existing non measurable lesions is determined or new lesions occur. Splitting and confluencing lesions When a lesion splits during follo\\nw-up examination, the individual product of the perpendicular diameters (PPDs) of the nodes should be summed together to represent the PPD of the split lesion. Likewise, if lesions \\nbecome confluent, the PPD of the confluent mass should be compared with the sum of the PPDs of the individual nodes, with more than 50% increase in the PPD of the confluent mass com\\npared with the sum of individual nodes necessary to indicate progressive disease.

We will discuss: by Angela D. Levy\\nIntroduction:\\nDifferential Diagnosis of bile duct dilatation:\\nWhenever there is bile duct dilatation, the first priority is to look for obstruction. Obstruction If there is an obstruction, we first look for gallstones in the bile duct.\\nIf there are no gallstones involved, we then look for strictures. The differential diagnosis for a stricture is based on the location. No Obstruction Once we have excluded obstructi\\non, we have to think about nonobstructive biliary diseases like:\\nCaroli Disease:\\nSaccular intrahepatic duct dilatation with normal sized choledochal duct in Caroli disease Caroli disease is an autosomal recessive disease secondary to the ductal plate malformatio\\nn. It is associated with polycystic kidney disease, medullary sponge kidney and medullary cystic disease. So looking at the kidneys can sometimes help you make this diagnosis. On th\\ne left we see images of a patient with Caroli disease. Notice the intrahepatic duct dilatation and the normal caliber of the choledochal duct (extrahepatic bile duct). Saccular bile\\n duct dilatation in Caroli disease The hallmark of Caroli disease is intrahepatic duct dilatation. The dilatation can be very large and saccular as seen in the case on the left or i\\nt can be very linear. Normal development of the ductal plate (Illustration by Aletta Frazier) Caroli Disease (2) The duct dilatation in Caroli disease is due to a congenital malform\\nation of the ductal plate, which is the precursor of the intrahepatic bile ducts. On the left we see the normal development of the ductal plate. Embryologically each bile duct begin\\ns as a single layer of cells that surrounds a portal vein. This layer then duplicates. Portions of this double layer fuse and resorb leaving unfused portions that become the bile du\\ncts. Abnormal development of the ductal plate(Illustration by Aletta Frazier) So in the normal situation each portal vein is surrounded by interconnecting bile ducts (left image). H\\nowever if the patient has ductal plate malformation, the bile ducts are too numerous and they are ectatic (right image). Whether or not we see this on imaging depends on which porti\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"on of the bile ducts is affected. If the large ducts are involved, we see this as Caroli disease. However if only the very small ducts are involved, the result is congenital hepatic\\n fibrosis. If all ducts are involved, then there is a combination of fibrosis and Caroli disease, which is also known as the Caroli syndrome. Central dot sign in Caroli disease\\nCentral dot sign:\\nMost commonly the intrahepatic duct dilatation is segmental (83%) in distribution. The diffuse form is less common (17%). The shape of the dilatation is saccular in 76% or fusiform \\nin 24% of the cases. A very important sign is the central dot sign. The central dot corresponds to the portal vein that is surrounded by dilated bile ducts. On the left we see a dot\\n within the dilated ducts. When we put on the color doppler, we will notice that these structures contain blood flow and represent portal veins. Central dot sign in Caroli disease C\\naroli Disease (3) On the left CT-images of the same patient. Notice the central dot sign and the segmental involvement. This patient has cirrhosis with splenomegaly due to portal hy\\npertension. Extrahepatic duct dilatation is present in 53% of cases, secondary to cholangitis and stone or sludge passage. These are secondary findings, that are not part of the pri\\nmary disease. When there is extensive fibrosis, these patients can develop cirrhosis over time. ERCP: Caroli disease with severe intrahepatic duct dilatation. No obstruction. Mild d\\nilatation of the choledochal duct due to cholangitis Caroli Disease (4) The cholangiogram is important in the work up of these patients, because obstruction has to be excluded. This\\n can be done with MRCP or ERCP, as is shown on the left. There was no sign of obstruction. The mild dilatation of the choledochal duct was the result of cholangitis. Study the image\\n on the left. Then continue reading. There is focal dilatation with intermixing strictures of the bile ducts in segment IV (arrow). The other bile ducts and the choledochal duct are\\n normal. In some of the cases of Caroli disease the imaging findings may simulate a cystic neoplasm as is seen in the case on the left. This case was originally diagnosed as a bilia\\nry cystadenoma. However, the gross specimen demonstrates dilated bile ducts and ductal plate malformation was present microscopically. Caroli disease with intraductal stone formatio\\nn Caroli Disease (5): Complications Patient with Caroli disease are usually brought to our attention, when they develop complications. These complications are commonly the result of\\n biliary stasis, which leads to stone formation and infection. Complications: On the left a patient with dilated bile ducts with intraductal stones (arrow) Study the image on the le\\nft. Then continue reading. The findings are: The mass in the right lobe of the liver turned out to be an abscess. Remember that liver abscesses in the early phase can look quite sol\\nid. In the differential diagnosis we would also have to include a neoplasm, because patients with Caroli disease have an increased risk of developing a cholangiocarcinoma. Cirrhosis\\n in a patient with Caroli disease Ultimately if there is substantial fibrosis and the entire liver is involved, these patients develop cirrhosis. The patient on the left developed s\\nevere liver failure and a resection was performed. Notice the intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, splenomegaly and dilated venous collaterals. In the resected specimen there is a cen\\ntral dot sign (blue arrow) and a small pus collection (yellow arrow). LEFT: Infiltrating cholangiocarcinoma with stricture in a patient with Caroli disease RIGHT: Intraductal cholan\\ngiocarcinoma Cholangiocarcinoma can take on many forms in patients with Caroli disease. The cholangiogram on the left demonstrates a focal stricture (blue arrow), which turned out t\\no be a infiltrating cholangiocarcinoma. The patient on the right has a cholangiocarcinoma in which the tumor was filling up the dilated ducts (yellow arrow).\\nCholedochal cyst:\\nA choledochal cyst is a congenital dilatation of the extrahepatic bile duct.\\nThese patients do not have a ductal plate abnormality.\\nThe most common theory for the development of a choledochal cyst is that the dilatation is due to an underlying anomalous pancreatico-biliary junction. In the anomalous junction the\\n biliary and pancreatic duct join proximal to the sphincter of Oddi. In these patients there is a long common channel. The theory is that when the sphincter of Oddi contracts, pancr\\neatic enzymes will flow into the bile duct and causing dilatation and in some cases, narrowing of the distal duct. Todani Classification of choledochal cysts\\nTodani Classification:\\nThis classification classifies the choledochal cysts into 5 cathegories. Type V, which is not shown on the left is Caroli disease. We now know, that Caroli is a different disease. T\\nype I is a true choledichal cyst with focal dilatation of the extrahepatic duct. This is the most frequent type (90-95% of the cases). Type IV is also a true choledichal cyst with d\\nilatation of the entire extrahepatic duct with involvement of portions of the intrahepatic ducts. The intrahepatic ducts taper normally to the periphery, indicating that there is no\\n obstruction. Type II and III are extremely rare and it is debatable whether or not these are true choledochal cysts. Type II is a diverticulum of the extrahepatic duct and many bel\\nieve that this entity is not related to an anomalous pancreatico-biliary junction. Type III is a choledochocele, where there is dilatation of the distal part of the bile duct. These\\n patients also have a normal pancreaticobiliary junction. Type IV choledochal cyst Choledochal cyst (2) On the left a patient with dilatation of both the extrahepatic duct and part \\nof the intrahepatic ducts. So this is a type IV. Notice that the peripheral ducts are normal, so this is not an obstructive pattern. Type IV choledochal cyst On the left another typ\\ne IV choledochal cyst. There is dilatation of the extrahepatic duct, cystic duct and a small portion of the left hepatic duct. There is no intrahepatic dilatation. Cholangiocarcinom\\na within a choledocha cyst Choledochal cyst (3) There is an association of bile duct adenocarcinoma and choledochal cysts. These carcinomas can occur within the choledochal cyst, li\\nke the case on the left, or in the gallbladder or anywhere else in the biliary ducts. In the bile ducts they can present as classic peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, Klatskin tumor or \\ndistal cholangiocarcinoma.\\nRecurrent Pyogenic Cholangitis (RPC):\\nRecurrent pyogenic cholangitis. Illustration by Heike Blum. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis is an uncommon disease in the western world. Most of these cases are seen in Asian countri\\nes. The etiology is unknown, although some of these patients have biliary parasites. The disease is characterized by the presence of intrahepatic pigmented stones and recurrent infe\\nction. These patients are also at risk of developing biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis of the left lobe with intrahepatic stones The left lobe\\n is the most common location of the disease due to the delayed drainage of the left system. On the left a typical case. There is focal dilatation of the bile ducts in the left lobe \\nwith stones. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis with resected specimen Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (2) On the left another example of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis. There is intrahe\\npatic lithiasis with focal diatation. A case like this is indistinguishable from focal Caroli disease with secundary stone formation.\\nPrimary Sclerosing Cholangitis:\\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis: MRCP and ERCP When we see intrahepatic bile duct dilatation with strictures and only mild dilatation, the first diagnosis we think of is primary scle\\nrosing cholangitis (PSC). We know however that there is a long differential diagnistic list which includes: The case on the left nicely demonstrates the bile duct strictures. Notice\\n that there is only mild dilatation, which is common in PSC. Primary sclerosing cholangitis with strictures both in the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Illustration by Heike Blu\\nm The hallmark of PSC is strictures, but early on in the disease the strictures can be difficult to appreciate. The underlying abnormality in PSC is fibrosis, which is of unknown et\\niology. PSC is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis in up to 70% of patients, but it can also be associated with Crohn's disease of the large intestine. The reason for the as\\nsociation with IBD is unknown, but it is thought to be the result of an immune response. Chronic inflammation surrounding a bile duct in PSC Primary sclerosing cholangitis (2) On th\\ne far left a histologic specimen demonstrating chronic inflammation surrounding the bile duct. The gross specimen demonstrates the thickening of the wall of the bile duct (arrow) ca\\nusing many strictures. The strictures in PSC are short in the order of 3-5 mm in length, which is helpful to remember because if you are looking for cholangiocarcinoma, the malignan\\nt strictures usually exceed 10 mm in length. PSC with thickening of the wall of the bile duct (arrow)\\nUltrasound findings:\\nOne of the earliest features in PSC is on sonography where we see thickening of the wall of the bile duct as is seen in the image on the left.

The differential diagnosis would include PSC, AIDS-cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. A cholangioca\\nrcinoma would be rather unlikely, because there is no obstruction. Continue with the CT. PSC with thickening of the wall of the bile duct (arrow)\\nCT findings:\\nOn the CT the liver looks quite normal. However if you look at the common bile duct in the pancreatic head you will notice the soft tissue density. The differential diagnosis would \\ninclude an impacted stone or cholangiocarcinoma, but since this patient had no obstruction, it was thought to be the result of bile wall thickening. The gallbladder wall is also thi\\nckened. Primary sclerosing cholangitis. CT findings Primary sclerosing cholangitis (3) On the left a patient with more severe disease. We can see mild bile duct dilatation with a di\\nscontinuous pattern. Primary sclerosing cholangitis. CT findings On the left a patient with more pronounced CT findings. Study the image and then continue reading. The findings are:\\n Primary sclerosing cholangitis. late CT findings Primary sclerosing cholangitis (4) Late CT features are seen on the images on the left. Study the images and then continue reading.\\n The findings are: Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Cholangiographic findings Cholangiography is used in the initial diagnosis of the disease, when there are only subtle strictures a\\nnd in patients known with PSC to look for new strictures that are suspicious for carcinoma. On cholangiography we can see: Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Cholangiographic findings \\nOn the left the typical findings in PSC. Notice the diverticula on the image on the right. Diverticula are very specific for the diagnosis PSC. So when you see these diverticula, yo\\nu should immediately search for subtle strictures in the intrahepatic ducts. MRCP in PSC. There is a long stricture suspective of cholangiocarcinoma (arrow) Primary sclerosing chola\\nngitis (5) On the left a MRCP in a pateint with PSC. Notice the large stricture, which is quite worriesome for cholagiocarcinoma (arrow). The strictures in PSC show an abrupt transi\\nssion, while here we see 'shouldering', which indicates mass-efect. In addition there is intrahepatic dilatation proximal to this stenotic area. MRCP and ERCP in a patient with a st\\nricture at the hilum On the left a MRCP in a patient demonstrating a stricture at the level of the hilum. On MRCP this stricture looked long and worriesome for cholangiocarcinoma. H\\nowever, on the ERCP, the ducts have been distended with contrast and we can see that this is a short stricture compatible with the diagnosis of PSC. During follow up this proved to \\nbe just PSC.\\nCholangiocarcinoma:\\nNormal columnar epithelium (left) transforms into adenocarcinoma (right) Cholangiocarcinoma (i.e., adenocarcinoma of the bile duct) arises from the columnar epithelium of the bile d\\nuct. It is characterized by malignant glands within a desmoplastic stroma. These tumors have an infiltrative growth pattern and do not have a capsule. Typical locations of cholangio\\ncarcinoma. There are four basic patterns of chlangiocarcinoma: (illustration on the left). Cholangiocarcinoma is an uncommon tumor, that is mostly seen in patients with underlying b\\nenign bilairy disease. The incidence in the U.S. is 2000 to 2500 cases per year (coloncancer 150.000 per year). In Asian countries the incidence is ten times greater due to more chr\\nonic biliary infection. High risk groups are patients with: Clinical presentation: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. RadPath correlation\\nIntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma:\\nThese arise in the very small peripheral ducts. These tumors have abundant fibrous stroma that can cause retraction of the liver capsule. The tumor typically enhances in the equilib\\nrium and delayed phases (5-10 minutes). Read more about intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Liver : Masses Part II : common liver tumors Early and late phase enhancement of a intrahe\\npatic cholangiocarcinoma Although these tumors are usually quite heterogeneous because the contrast uptake is delayed and can be irregular. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Capsular\\n retraction and the late enhancement The key findings to look for are: On the left a typical case. Notice the capsular retraction (blue arrow) and the late enhancement (yellow arrow\\n). Intraductal Cholangiocarcinoma\\nIntraductal Cholangiocarcinoma:\\nThese are very rare tumors. They present as a intrabiliary mass with biliary dilatation peripheral to the mass. Klatskin Tumor with dilatation of bile ducts in the right and left lo\\nbe of the liver Illustration by Heike Blum\\nKlatskin Tumor - Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma:\\nThe most common site of biliary adenocarcinoma is at or near the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. These tumors are also known as Klatskin tumors. Klatskin tumors have\\n an aggressive biologic behavior. Imaging features: On the left a nice correlation between an illustration and a sonographic image of a Klatskin tumor. Notice how ill-defined the tu\\nmor is. Klatskin Tumor. Barely visible. Stent in situ (arrow) On CT these tumors can be very difficult to visualize. Many of these patients already have a stent in place when they f\\nirst come to CT which makes it even harder (figure). Klatskin Tumor: arterial and portal venous phase Klatskin Tumor (2) In the case on the left we can identify the tumor at the con\\nfluens of the left and right hepatic duct. The margins of the tumor however are imperceptible because of the infiltrative growth. Based on the CT it is not possible to stage the tum\\nor correctly. Hiar Cholagiocarcinoma. Notice the superiority of ERCP to MRCP. The image on the right nicely demonstrates the shouldering at the hilum and the multiple strictures. In\\n these tumors it may be difficult to get a definitive diagnosis pre-operatively. Biopsy is almost impossible and results of endoscopic brushing are commonly negative. The staging is\\n done with cholangiography and is based on the finding of mass effect (shouldering), irregular margins and abrupt tapering at the obstruction. The limitations of MRCP in staging are\\n the spatial resolution and the inability in the evaluation of the secondary ducts. ERCP is superior to MRCP (figure) Klatskin Tumor (3) : Resectability These tumors are unresectabl\\ne when: Bismuth-Corlette type I tumor with abrupt stricture and shouldering below the confluens\\nKlatskin Tumor - Bismuth-classification:\\nBismuth-Corlette type I A type I tumor is a lesion limited of the common hepatic duct, i.e. below the confluence. These patients can undergo resection with bile duct recontruction b\\necause the confluence is normal. Bismuth-Corlette type II tumor with extention into the origin of the right and left hepatic duct. Bismuth-Corlette type II A type II tumor is a lesi\\non that extends to the confluence.

              " Document(page_content='false-negative diagnosis. Special attention will be given to: For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com\\nDiagnostic strategy in suspected appendicitis:\\nThe policy in patients with an acute abdomen in the Netherlands has a well-established scientific basis (Table) (Lameris et al. BMJ 2009;338: b2431). CRP and WBC as well as clinical\\n impression, play an important role in choosing between complementary CT scan and watchful waiting.\\nFirst US, than CT.:\\nPatients with suspected appendicitis are relatively young, and it seems reasonable to begin with US in most patients. In this 11-week pregnant woman, US confirmed an intact intra-ut\\nerine pregnancy as well as acute appendicitis. \\nNote the different cm-scales. Laparoscopic  removal of the inflamed appendix  was successful.\\nCT if inconclusive US:\\nIn most patients with an inconclusive US and a high suspicion of appendicitis, CT is the next step. \\nA fortunate circumstance for CT, is that these patients are often obese. \\nCT is principally performed with i.v. contrast. If there is serious pain in elderly patients with a wide differential diagnosis, triphasic CT and even CT-thorax, can be added. In ou\\nr hospital of all patients who undergo CT for acute abdomen, in about 15 % a CT thorax is ordered within 24 hours, and vice versa. In case of renal impairment, CT without contrast m\\nay be diagnostic as in these three patients. If CT without contrast is non-diagnostic, repeat CT with iv contrast after correction of renal function. Table. Results of combined US/C\\nT findings, the report and the ensuing policy When both US and CT are done, it is important to integrate US and CT findings into a combined report. The combination of US with option\\nal CT, is highly accurate for appendicitis, and is inconclusive  in less than 1% of high-suspicion patients (maybe 2 to 3 patients per year in our hospital). Repeat US and/or CT and\\n also diagnostic laparoscopy are then helpful.\\nFirst CT than US:\\nWhen for some reason CT scan is chosen as primary investigation, US after CT can also be useful. In this elderly lady with atypical abdominal pain and renal insufficiency, a non-con\\ntrast CT  revealed a dubiously inflamed appendix. Focused US with a high-frequency probe confirmed that the ventrally located appendix was inflamed. In this obese patient, CT identi\\nfied a deeply located, possibly inflamed appendix (arrow) at a distance of 11 cms from the skin. Focused US with graded compression reduced this distance to < 3 cms, allowing the us\\ne of a high frequency probe, which  showed a non-compressible, inflamed appendix (arrow). In this young man the appendix could not be identified on CT scan due to lack of intra-abdo\\nminal fat. US easily demonstrated a normal appendix.\\nFalse-negative diagnosis:\\nUS non-visualization of the appendix: tricks and tips:\\nThe most important reason for a false-negative ultrasound examination is overlooking the inflamed appendix. \\nThe greatest problem is non-visualization of the appendix. In adult patients, the numbers are as follows (Table). In expe\\xadrienced hands the inflamed appendix can be visualized in 80\\n-90% of patients with acute appendicitis. Hereunder the pitfalls leading to non-visualization and how to avoid them.\\nRetrocecal appendicitis:\\nThe appendix is usually found at the spot of maximum tenderness. In retrocecal appendicitis (arrow) the cecum is often pushed medially with the US probe, so that the appendix (arrow\\n) appears to be localized lateral to the cecum than behind it. Another possibility to visualize the appendix in retrocecal appendicitis is positioning of the probe in the right flan\\nk, thereby avoiding the gas and feces-filled cecum. Another trick in retrocecal appendicitis is to push the inflamed appendix (arrow) with your left hand in the direction of the pro\\nbe. To find the appendix, it may be useful at first to identify the ileocecal valve (see also US of the GI tract: normal anatomy). The base of the appendix is usually found 3 centim\\neters caudally, where it leaves the cecal pole at the medial side. The biggest problem for US  is a deep pelvic location of the appendix. In this pregnant, obese woman, a possible i\\nnflamed appendix (arrow with question mark) was visualized during forceful compression deep down in the pelvis. Subsequent transvaginal US  showed a pus-filled, inflamed appendix wi\\nthin 1 cm of the vaginal probe. Appendicitis with air in the lumen Air in the lumen can make it difficult to identify the inflamed appendix (arrowheads). The echolucent wall and the\\n surrounding inflamed fat (*), make clear that appendicitis is present. Tip appendicitis. a and v = iliac artery and vein Another pitfall is tip-appendicitis, where the inflammation\\n is confined to the distal tip. If only the normal, proximal part (arrows in A) is visualized, and the distal end  (arrows in B) would have been obscured by bowel gas, a false-negat\\nive diagnosis may be the result. (a and v = iliac artery and vein) The presence of a genera\\xadli\\xadzed, paralytic ileus is suspect for perfo\\xadrated appen\\xaddici\\xadtis, and if the inflamed ap\\npendix cannot be visua\\xadlized, CT is mandatory, also to exclude other conditions. This 66-year old man presented with excruciating abdominal pain with generalized peritonitis and a C\\nRP of 550. \\nUS revealed only dilated small bowel, CT was done for suspected mesenteric ischemia. CT demonstrated appendicitis (arrow) with a perforated tip and four-quadrant contamination of th\\ne peritoneal cavity.\\nMistaking an inflamed appendix for a normal appendix:\\nIn 7 % of patients with appendicitis, the inflamed appendix has a US diameter of less than 7 mm. If there is hypervascularity and inflamed fat and the patient has mild symptoms, thi\\ns is usually a case of spontaneously resolving appendicitis (see Appendicitis: US findings). This young man had a rapidly subsiding symptoms at the time of US, with CRP 1 and WBC 9.\\n Surgery was nevertheless performed and histology confirmed ordinary, acute appendicitis. Perforated appendix with normal diameter In advanced appendicitis, the inflamed appendix (a\\nrrow) may have a very small diameter, because it has emptied itself into an abscess. In these two cases, the secondary US findings of puscollections and inflamed fat, give away the \\ncorrect diagnosis.\\nIncorrect diagnosis of an alternative condition:\\nIn some patients, US findings may suggest an alternative condition, while in fact appendicitis is present. \\nThis is obviously a dangerous pitfall. Acute appendicitis with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes In this 16 year old patient with RLQ pain, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes surrounded \\nby some inflamed fat (*) were the only US finding and the appendix could not be identified. CT confirmed the enlarged nodes (arrowheads), but revealed an inflamed appendix (arrow), \\noriginating from the cecum in deep pelvic position. Young patients with acute appendicitis often have secondarily enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Mesenteric lymphadenitis\\nMesenteric lymphadenitis:\\nIf enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are the only US findings in a young patient with RLQ pain, the diagnosis of viral mesenteric lymphadenitis can be considered. It is however mandat\\nory to identify the normal appendix (arrow) with certainty, because enlarged nodes can be secondary to appendicitis.\\nInfectious ileocecitis / ileocolitis:\\nAnother pitfall is when secondary wall thickening of ileum or right colon is visualized, but the underlying appendicitis is overlooked. In this patient initially the submucosal colo\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 43}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='nic wall thickening was interpreted as infectious ileocolitis by Campylobacter or Salmonella. Positioning of the probe in the right flank, revealed the inflamed appendix (arrow) sur\\nrounded by inflamed fat (*).\\nThe presence of inflamed fat in itself is a key finding, because this is never found in infectious colitis. Appendicitis (arrow) causing secondary thickening of the neighboring ileu\\nm.(A and V= iliac artery and vein) In these two patients initially the mucosal thickening of the terminal ileum as a sole US finding was interpreted as Crohn’s ileitis or infectious\\n ileitis. A second US exam revealed the underlying appendicitis (arrow) causing secondary thickening of the neighboring ileum. Acute appendicitis and right ovarian cyst. (v= iliac v\\nein)\\nRight ovarian cyst:\\nAnother pitfall is the erroneous diagnosis of an alternative gynecological condition, while in fact appendicitis is present. In this young woman, a conspicuous hemorrhagic right ova\\nrian cyst (arrowheads) was visualized and held responsible for her RLQ symptoms. Further searching however revealed acute appendicitis, the cyst being a confusing coincidental findi\\nng.\\nCecal diverticulitis:\\nIn this patient young patient with cecal diverticulitis the most prominent fat stranding (arrowheads) is found around a cecal diverticulum, containing a fecolith (*). The appendix (\\narrow) is secondarily inflamed due to the nearby cecal diverticulitis. Complete cure with conservative treatment.\\nEpiploic appendagitis:\\nThis 39-year old man had 24 hours of pain in the RLQ  with severe local peritonitis, clinically very suspect for acute appendicitis. He had an important business flight to Taiwan th\\ne next morning. US shows a 7 mm not well compressible appendix (arrow) with inflamed fat (arrowheads), which was located medially, rather than surrounding the appendix. Continue wit\\nh next images...

Epiploic appendagitis CT confirmed a normal appendix surrounded by normal fat and an adjacent, a small epiploic appendagitis (arrowhead). He was rea\\nssured, was given painkillers and caught his flight to Taiwan the next morning. This patient also underlines the observation that, in epiploic appendagitis, there is no relation bet\\nween size and the degree of local peritonitis. So, in epiploic appendagitis size does not matter. Epiploic appendagitis This 41-year old male had severe local peritonitis in the RLQ\\n. The longitudinal US image showed a concentrically layered ovoid structure (arrowheads) surrounded by inflamed fat (*), suggestive for an inflamed appendix. In the transverse plane\\n however the US image structure was also ovoid (arrowheads). Subsequent CT scan demonstrated that  the ovoid structure in fact was a small infarcted epiploic appendage. CT also iden\\ntified  the normal appendix (arrows). Epiploic appendagitis This was a 73-year old lady with severe RLQ pain, CRP  and a local, not well described area of inflamed fat (arrowheads).\\n CT confirmed a small epiploic appendagitis (arrowheads) and a normal appendix (arrows). Again, no relation between local pain symptoms and size of the infarcted epiploic appendage.\\n Omental infarction\\nFalse-positive US diagnosis:\\nIn young children, the normal appendix may be large due to very prominent lymphoid hyperplasia of the deep mucosa. In this 6-year old, asymptomatic child a large appendix was seen. \\nNotice that you can identify the normal anatomical layers of the appendix.\\nCrohn’s disease:\\nMistaking a normal for an inflamed appendix may also occur if there is secondary thickening of the appendix associ\\xadated with another condition. These images, though 30 years old, ar\\ne still illustrative.\\nIn this young man with suspected appendicitis both  ileum and appendix (arrow) were thickened, due to ileocecal Crohn disease, also affecting the appendix. Barium study confirms Cro\\nhn ileitis and shows irregular filling of the appendix, proving that this is a case of non-obstructive Crohn appendicitis. Variable involvement of the appendix (arrow) in ileocecal \\nCrohn disease: This patient with pain RLQ,  had a complicated appendectomy with abscess formation 4 years earlier, with intermittent symptoms afterwards. Now US shows a Crohn ileiti\\ns with a fistula (*) in the direction of the cecal pole. \\nCT and bariumstudy confirm Crohn ileitis (arrowheads) and a fistula (arrow)  from the ileum to the cecal pole. After ileocecal resection, he remained symptom free for at least 15 ye\\nars.\\nCecal carcinoma:\\nIn cecal carcinoma, atypical clinical findings may lead to serious delay, because the erroneous diagnosis of “appendiceal mass” is made. US and CT findings may add to the confusion,\\n by showing mucinous dilatation of the appendix due to obstructive ingrowth of tumour in the appendix base. Tumour-based obstruction rarely leads to full-blown appendicitis. Enable \\nScroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll This is a 79-year old woman with vague RLQ pain since six weeks.

Of all normal appendices, 7 % is larger than 7 mm (see US of the GI tract). Clinical p\\nresentation and the presence / absence of inflamed fat are the most decisive features. In doubtful cases like in this patient in whom an 8 mm appendix with dubious inflamed fat (*) \\n was visualized including the blind end (arrowheads), clinical follow-up and repeated US the next day is a safe policy. \\nTry to convince the surgeon, that an appendix like this will not rupture overnight. If the patient is painful with a high CRP, CT should be the next step, especially to exclude othe\\nr conditions.

The pancreatic exudate (*) approaches the appendix (arrow) closely.\\nAbnormal location of the appendix:\\nCourtesy Dr. Netter The appendix base most often lies near McBurney’s point.\\nHowever there is a wide variation in location of the cecum and also in the orientation of the appendix (figure). An inguinal hernia containing the appendix, is named Amyand’s hernia\\n. In case of an abnormal position of the inflamed appendix far from McBurney’s point, it is useful to indicate the location of the appendix on the skin with a waterproof pencil. Thi\\ns may influence site, size and orientation of the incision and also the choice for laparoscopic appendectomy. In this 30-week pregnant lady with early appendicitis (arrow), the draw\\ning enabled the surgeon to perform a small incision, exactly over the appendix base. In this young man the acute RUQ pain was explained by an inflamed appendix (arrow) in unusual hi\\ngh position. Note the distance  from McBurney’s point (dot). The appendix was laparoscopically removed. Appendix in unusual location This patient was clinically suspected of pyelone\\nphritis. On the spot of maximum tenderness with the probe in intercostal position, an inflamed appendix (arrow) was visualized. CT confirmed the unusual location (arrows).

The question is, when do we need to think of a malignant\\ntumor, since many radiologists will not frequently be confronted with a\\nmalignant tumor. In this article we provide you with some red flags, that may help\\nyou to recognize the occasional malignant lesion in daily practice.\\nIntroduction:\\nIn the table you will find the red flags, that makes the lesion suspicious for malignancy, although there are exceptions where benign lesions may also show red flags.\\nMore red flegs means more suspicious. We will discuss all these items in the next chapters.\\nGrowth pattern:\\nThe table shows the different etiologies between lesions with a destructive versus an expansile pattern A destructive growth pattern means full thickness break of mineralized bone.\\nThis is most frequently seen in malignant tumors, but also in aggressive benign tumors and inflammation.

Findings: MRI was performed to confirm the most likely diagnosis of a mucocele... The MRI shows an expansile\\n lesion with only rim enhancement. There is no enhancement within the lesion.

Final diagnosis: inverted papilloma. This is another inverted pap\\nilloma. It presents as a lobulated mucosal mass with a ‘cerebriform’ appearance. As if we are looking at gyri (arrowheads). \\nThis finding is somewhat specific for inverted papilloma Next to a malignant lesion, another cause of unilateral paranasal obstruction has to be kept in mind.\\nThis is illustrated in this case.

Images\\nThere is a soft tissue obliteration of the right maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinus (a so-called ‘infundibular pattern’). \\nAs discussed above, this is a red flag.

              " Document(page_content='Department of Radiology and Regional Spinal Cord Injury Center of the Delaware Valley, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia and the Radiology Department of the Free Un\\niversity Medical Center and the Academical Medical Center, Amsterdam:\\nPublicationdate 2015-05-01 The Thoraco-Lumbar Injury Classification and Severity score (TLICS) is a classification system for thoracolumbar spine injuries, designed to assist in cli\\nnical management. Unlike other classifications, the TLICS is an easy scoring system that depicts the features important in predicting spinal stability, future deformity, and progres\\nsive neurologic compromise. TLICS also facilitates appropriate treatment recommendations.\\nIntroduction:\\nMost classification systems of spine injuries are based on injury mechanisms and describe how the injury occurred. This is all based on the premise that a fracture caused by forward\\n flexion should be treated by undoing the flexion by positioning the patient in an extension brace, or by surgical intervention correcting the spinal column in extension. Some of th\\ne injuries thought to be due to extension mechanisms, however, turn out to be due to flexion and vice versa. These descriptions may thus be misleading. A problem with classification\\ns such as the AO-classification is that they are usually complex, leading to high inter-reader variability. Using the popular Denis three-column classification may lead to another s\\nituation since it uses the terms stable and unstable. In many cases, however, there is no good correlation with the necessity for surgery. Furthermore, the word stability itself is \\nambiguous and may refer to direct osseous stability; it may refer to neurological stability and finally, to long-term (ligamentous) stability. Both of these commonly used systems fa\\nil to systematically take into account the neurological status of the patient and the indication for MRI to determine the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex. For these r\\neasons the Spine Trauma Study Group introduced in 2005 the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Scale (1), with intention to be a reliable, ease-to-use tool to facilitat\\ne clinical decision making and as a practical alternative to cumbersome classification systems already in use. The TLICS consists of three independent parameters: A parameter can be\\n scored 0-4 points and the total score is the sum of these parameters with a maximum of 10 points. The total score predicts the need for surgery as is shown in the TLICS algorithm. \\nA total of more than 4 points indicates surgical treatment. A compression fracture gets 1 point. When it is complicated by a burst, it gets an additional 1 point, resulting in 2 poi\\nnts. The integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex plays an important role in the TLICS. Sometimes it will be possible to determine PLC injury on CT, but MRI may be necessary. \\nWhen there are several fractures, each level has to be scored separately. The level with the highest TLICS score will determine the type of treatment. Morphology and PLC are scored \\nseparately. For example, in a translation/rotation injury, the PLC is always involved, making a total of 3+3=6 points. When there is a distraction on the posterior side, the PLC is \\nalways involved, making a total of 4+3=7 points. In case of a distraction on the anterior side, however, the PLC may or may not be involved, i.e. it will be either 4 or 4+3= 7 point\\ns.\\nMorphology:\\nPosterior Ligamentous Complex:\\nThe PLC serves as a posterior \"tension band\" of the spinal column and plays an important role in the stability of the spine (3). A torn PLC has a tendency not to heal and can lead t\\no progressive kyphosis and collapse. The PLC is composed of the supraspinous ligaments, interspinous ligaments, articular facet capsules, and ligamenta flava (figure). The supraspin\\nous ligament is a strong, cordlike ligament which connects the tips of the spinous processes from C7 to the sacrum. The interspinous ligaments are weak, thin, membranous structures \\nconnecting the adjacent spinous processes. The contractile force of the ligamenta flava presses the vertebrae together and keeps them aligned. The facet joints act against rotationa\\nl forces. CT features of PLC pathology are: When the PLC is definitely injured on CT, it can already be scored as 3. Since the integrity of the PLC depends mostly on ligamentous str\\nuctures, MR is sometimes needed to adequately diagnose pathology of the PLC, especially when there is no dislocation or disruption on CT. MRI features of PLC pathology are: MRI has \\na tendency to overdiagnose PLC injury (4). In some cases it can be difficult to decide whether there is a burst fracture with a torn PLC or distraction with a torn PLC and a compres\\nsion fracture (figure). You have to decide what you think is the main issue: the collapse of the vertebral body or the distraction. Since in both cases the TLICS score based on imag\\ning will be high, there is usually an indication for surgical treatment. TLICS score In case of multiple fractures, you have to score each level separately. The level with the highe\\nst TLICS score usually will be decisive for the therapy of choice.\\nNeurological status:\\nThe third category is the neurological status as determined by the neurologist or spine surgeon. The role of the radiologist is to report the following: One of the key points here i\\ns that an incomplete cord lesion will likely benefit more from surgery than a complete lesion; therefore a complete cord injury is scored as only 2 points, while an incomplete cord \\ninjury gets 3 points.\\nModifiers:\\nModifiers are other factors which can affect the decision of appropriate treatment: Sternum fracture Sternum fracture The image shows a vertebral fracture with a transverse fracture\\n of the spinous process, but also a fracture of the sternum. Analogous to the 3-column classification of Denis, some investigators consider the sternum as the fourth column in upper\\n thoracic spinal fractures and recognize it as an independent variable in the assessment and treatment of these patients (5). Rigid spine Patients with a rigid spine (such as in ank\\nylosing spondylitis, DISH and rheumatoid arthritis) are more susceptible to spinal fractures, even after minimal trauma (6). Ossification of the spinal ligaments and calcification o\\nf the annulus fibrosus alter the biomechanics of the spine, creating long lever arms and limiting the ability to absorb even minor impacts. The bone is usually very osteoporotic. Th\\ne images are of a patient with a typical bamboo spine as a result of ankylosing spondylitis. After a fall on his back no fracture was seen on the x-rays. However the CT shows a thin\\n fracture line through the anterior side of the vertebral body and also through the spinous process. Continue with the MR-images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Look at the images. What are the findings? Then scroll to the next images. The findings are: The TLICS-score is high, because there is distraction and injury to the P\\nLC.\\nSimple compression:\\nA simple compression fracture is the most common form of injury and is seen in 90% of cases. It is either loss of height of the anterior part of the vertebral body or disruption of \\nthe vertebral endplate. The posterior cortex of the vertebral body has to be intact and this feature differentiates a simple compression fracture from the more severe burst fracture\\n. The posterior cortex may bulge slightly posteriorly in a simple compression fracture. As long as there is no free fragment with posterior displacement, it is a wedge compression f\\nracture and not a burst fracture. The images show a compression fracture. All we see is a cortical disruption in the upper anterior wall of the vertebral body and slight loss of hei\\nght ventrally. The posterior vertebral cortex is intact. The sagittal reformatted image also shows the cortical disruption. Notice that on a 2.5mm axial slice you can miss these fra\\nctures. You have to look at the thin slices to detect such a subtle fracture. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images. Notice the horizontal band of density, which is often described as sclerosis. This density does not mean that it involves an older fracture\\n that is already healing with sclerosis.

Pitfalls in diagnosing a compression fracture are: The images show two cases of osteochondro\\nsis. On the right with kyphosis.\\nBurst fracture:\\nThis is the severe variant of a compression fracture with higher risk of neurologic deficits. The name is derived from the typical fracture following a fall from height and landing \\non the feet. A burst fracture gets 2 points for morphology in the TLICS. This means that a patient can be treated non-surgically. In the absence of a neurologic deficit, PLC integri\\nty should be confirmed at MR imaging, especially if conservative management of a burst fracture is planned (3). In the Denis classification a burst fracture is classified as a two-c\\nolumn injury, calling it unstable and requiring surgical stabilization. Subsequent modifications of the Denis classification have recognized that with an intact posterior ligamentou\\ns complex (PLC), two-column unstable injuries can be successfully treated non-surgically (3).

Scroll through the images. Sagittal\\nfracture of vertebral body and\\nposterior element A sagittal fracture of the vertebral body and a sagittal posterior element fracture is seen in respectively 90% and 85% of cases of burst fracture cases. Here are \\nfour examples. In the Denis classification this would be a three column fracture -anterior/middle/posterior - indicating a very unstable fracture. In the TLICS classification howeve\\nr this is a burst fracture, i.e. 2 points for morphology. The treatment will depend on the PLC integrity and the neurological status. Widening of the interpedicular distance Widenin\\ng of the interpedicular distance, often a result of the sagittal fracture, is seen in 80% of burst fractures. The lateral view shows the typical features of a burst fracture. On the\\n AP-view notice the subtle widening of the interpedicular distance compared to the levels above and below. The axial CT and MRI in the same patient show the displaced fragment press\\ning on the thecal sac. On the sagittal CT and MRI there are no signs of posterior ligamentous injury. The anterior longitudinal ligament is disrupted. The right facet joint looks a \\nbit widened on the CT and there is some fluid in the joint on the MRI. If there was a lot of fluid in the joint, we should call this indeterminate. In this case we are not sure. Ena\\nble Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images. How would you describe the morphology and the PLC? The findings are: You could argue that these fractures of the spinous processes indicate\\n distraction, i.e. 4 points for morphology. However in this case the compression is the most prominent finding.\\nTranslation - Rotation:\\nThis type of fracture includes all fractures that are the result of displacement in the horizontal plane: side-to-side motion, either left-to-right or anterior-to-posterior or side-\\nto-side rotary motion of one vertebral body with respect to another. Often unilateral or bilateral facet dislocation is seen in rotational fractures. It is a severe type of injury, \\nwhich always involves the PLC. In the TLICS this means 3 points for the morphology and 3 points for the PLC, which makes a total of 6 points indicating the need for surgical stabili\\nzation.

However notice the following: Even though there is not much d\\nisplacement at this moment, we should probably call this translation injury. Continue with the axial images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll On the axial images we see: These are typical findings in translation-rotation fractures. So we should call this a translation fracture with anterior displacement.\\nDistraction:\\nA distraction injury is separation or pulling apart of two adjacent vertebrae. It is a severe injury since there is a high chance of cord injury when its osseous and ligamentous sup\\nporting structures are pulled apart. A distraction injury on the posterior side can lead to a compression fracture on the anterior side. So be sure not to underestimate the injury b\\ny only looking at the compression fracture and overlooking the distraction injury. In some cases it is difficult to decide whether you are dealing with distraction combined with a c\\nompression fracture or with a compression fracture with PLC-injury. If the distraction is the main feature, then the morphology is distraction, i.e. 4 points. In these cases the PLC\\n is always involved, resulting in a total of 7 points for the TLICS-score. If compression is the main feature, then the morphology is burst, i.e. 2 points combined with the PLC inju\\nry making a total of 5 points. In both cases the patient is a surgical candidate. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images. What are the findings? In this case the main findings are the horizontal fractures of the posterior elements. The vertebral body fractures \\nshow hardly any compression. Notice that there are 3 vertebrae involved. Only the level with the highest score counts.

However the most important findings are the horizontal fractures of the posterior elements. TLICS score based on imaging is 7 points.

There is n\\not much else happening here. The disc space is markedly widened about four times the normal level. The facet joints are separated on both sides. There is a spinous process fracture,\\n which is not a key element but a frequently associated injury. Continue with the MR. The MRI shows exactly the same things. Frequently when you have a good CT, you have most of the\\n anatomic information. The MRI also shows disruption of the ligamentum flavum and a partial disruption of the interspinous ligament. TLICS score: This patient is at high risk of dev\\neloping a spinal cord injury. Here a fracture that just looks like another compression fracture on the lateral view. At first glance the AP-view doesn't look very odd. That is until\\n we zoom in and look at the distance between the spinous processes. Now when you look carefully at the lateral view, you will notice that the facets are separated. The MRI tells us \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",

There is major disruption of the PLC of both t\\nhe ligamenta flava and the interspinous ligament. TLICS: distraction injury + PLC disruption. This is an interesting case since non-surgical management was initially attempted in th\\nis patient. However when we classify according to the TLICS-score, we give 4 points for the morphology and 3 points for the PLC. Assuming the neurological exam was normal, this pati\\nent would still get 7 points. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, conservative management failed with near-dislocation. Finally a posterior spondylodesis was performed. Here's anot\\nher example. You could call these compression fractures. There is loss of height with a dense band of impaction and there is an anterosuperior corner fracture on both levels. But lo\\nok at the spinous processes. One of the spinous processes is in two pieces and the two pieces are widely separated. So this is a distraction fracture, also known as Chance fracture.\\n Now when you describe such a fracture the first word in your report should be distraction, i.e. morphology: 4 points. This next case has a great teaching point. There is widening b\\netween the spinous processes. But there are also little pieces ofbone, that have avulsed at least 10mm away. At first we thought that little pieces of bone didn't matter, but they m\\nay be the most important sign of a major injury on a CT-scan. The fact that these little pieces of bone have been so severely displaced means there has to be a major injury. Now in \\nthis case there are lots of other things going on, but sometimes these little pieces of bone are all you get. If you look back, see how nicely it correlates with the PLC-injury on t\\nhe MRI. The teaching point is: pay careful attention to little pieces of bone. Patients with a rigid spine are more at risk for translation or distraction. Here is a patient with di\\nstraction on the anterior side. Notice the rigid spine and how easily this major injury can be overlooked. This patient had a motorcycle accident. The MRI demonstrates rupture of th\\ne flava ligaments, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments as well as fracture of the posterior elements and compression of the vertebral body. A posterior spondylodesis was perform\\ned. Here another distraction injury. At surgery the rupture of the supraspinous ligament was confirmed (red and black arrows)\\nAdditional Cases:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Case 1 Scroll through the images.

The following subjects will be discussed: MRI protocol \\nSystematic approach\\nSystematic approach:\\nWe use a checklist when evaluating an MRI of the Ankle: When you have evaluated all these structures, combine your findings and try to make a specific diagnosis.\\nBones:\\nBone marrow edema:\\nStart your exam with fatsat images of the bones to screen for edema. Bone marrow edema is only an indication that there is something abnormal in the bone or connected structures. Th\\nis patient has bone marrow edema on the posterior side of the distal tibia. On the axial image, the edema is localised around the insertion site of the posterior syndesmosis. This i\\ns edema due to a ligamentous avulsion injury. Here two patients with bone marrow edema. The patient on the left has bone marrow edema in the medial malleolus. The patient on the rig\\nht has edema in the medial talus. Both patients have had an eversion injury, with stretching of the deltoid ligament. The bone marrow edema in these patients is due to avulsion inju\\nry on the insertion sites of the deltoid ligament. This patient has bone marrow edema in both the medial malleolus and the medial talus. The lateral ligaments also show edema and th\\nickening. The bone marrow edema is likely due to impaction of talus and medial malleolus secondary to inversion injury.\\nStress fractures:\\nStress fractures of the calcaneus are a frequently unrecognized source of heel pain. This patient has edema in the calcaneus as a result of a stress fracture. This injury usually re\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='sults from overuse, especially in runners. When the fracture is not seen on the T2W fatsat-images, look at the non-fatsat T2W or the T1W- images for a hypointense fracture line. Som\\netimes the fracture line is not seen on MR. In those cases you may consider a CT-scan which can be more sensitive. This patient has multiple stress fractures of the calcaneus. In th\\nis patient there is very subtle edema in the distal fibula. No fracture line is visible. There is subtle thickening of the cortex and some infiltration of the subperiosteum. When th\\nere is edema like in this case and no visible fracture line, you may consider CT. Do not mention the edema without having ruled out a fracture line on MR or CT. Stress fractures are\\n easy to miss on MR alone and this could lead to a wrong diagnosis like for instance osteomyelitis. In this case there is a lot of edema in the navicular bone. The axial image nicel\\ny depicts the stress fracture.\\nOCD:\\nOCD is an abbreviation which can stand for either Osteochondritis Dissecans or Osteochondral Defect. Osteochondritis dissecans is used when the patient is young and the cause is not\\n exactly known, yet most probably due to repetitive microtrauma. Osteochondral defect is mainly used when a patient is older or when a particular trauma is thought to be the cause o\\nf the defect. Both describe a joint defect which involves the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. When a small defect in the chondral plate is present, the intr\\naarticular fluid will erode the subchondral bone, which will result in bone marrow edema. This process can evolve into cyst formation. Finally, when fluid flows underneath the defec\\nt, the OCD can become unstable and may result in a corpus liberum. Here three patients with various stages of OCD.\\nOs Trigonum:\\nIn the foot and ankle many accessory ossicles can be seen. The most common ossicle is the os trigonum, which is a prominent unfused apophysis of the lateral tubercle of the talus. T\\nhe os trigonum is present in the normal population in about 5-15%. Compression of the os trigonum and surrounding soft tissues between the tibia and the calcaneus during plantar fle\\nxion can be a cause of posterior impingement. This is especially seen in ballet dancers. The term Stieda process is used, when the lateral tubercle is very prominent. This can also \\nlead to posterior impingement. Here another patient with an os trigonum. On the fatsat images edema is present in the os trigonum and surrounding soft tissue. This is an example of \\nposterior impingement due to a symptomatic os trigonum. Here an example of an os trigonum with rather subtle edema. This case is shown to demonstrate the great variety of ossicles a\\nnd tubercles on the posterior side of the talus. This patient has an unfused prominent lateral tubercle with a fibrous connection to the talus, therefore it is a partly fused os tri\\ngonum. On the axial image more unfused prominent tubercles on both the medial and lateral side of the lateral tubercle are seen.\\nJoints:\\nEffusion:\\nOnce you have studied the bones, scan the joints for effusion. The left image shows a normal fluid accumulation in the tibiotalar joint, talocalcaneal joint en retrocalcaneal bursa.\\n The right image shows massive joint effusion as a reaction to degenerative osteochondral defects in the tibiotalar joint. The effusion can run alongside the flexor hallucis longus \\ntendon (FHL), since this tendon sheath is continuous with the joint. Two examples of diffuse joint effusion in the tibiotalar joint. There is also some joint effusion in the talocal\\ncaneal joint.\\nCapsular thickening:\\nThe ankle joint is lined by the joint capsule. When the capsule is thickened, it may cause impingement or synovitis, which can be seen in the image in the middle. The capsule thicke\\nning can be posttraumatic or postoperative. On the right a patient who developed postoperative fibrosis after resection of a Haglund exostosis. There is fibrosis along the posterior\\n calcaneus and the posterior joint capsule. In this patient there is only a small effusion in the ankle joint. On the non fatsat images there is subtle thickening of the capsule, wi\\nth reactive changes in the surrounding soft tissue. This patient had anterior ankle pain due to impingement by the thickened capsule. Here another example of thickening of the capsu\\nle. On the fatsat images, you may think that there is only some edema in the subcutaneous fatty tissue. On the non fatsat images however, there is obvious thickened fibrotic tissue \\non the anterior side. Capsular thickenig and soft tissue abnormalities are usually better seen on non-fatsat images. In this case there is fibrous thickening of the capsule (arrow).\\n This patient has secundary degenerative changes in the joint with subchondral edema and cyst formation. It is a result of repetitive impaction of the fibrotic tissue on the bone du\\nring dorsal flexion.\\nLigaments:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nAnatomy in axial plane:\\nScroll through the image stack for the ligamentous anatomy in the axial plane. You can click on the image to enlarge. The syndesmoses are best seen on axial images: The syndesmoses \\nare usually involved in exorotation injuries like:\\nAnterior syndesmosis:\\nIn A - a normal anterior syndesmosis is seen as a thin low intensity band. In B - the anterior syndesmosis is thickened with edema, indicating partial tearing or grade 2 injury. In \\nC - the anterior syndesmosis is thickened and there probably is a focal discontinuity (arrow) and that is the reason why this was called a grade 3 injury (full thickness tear). Isol\\nated injury of the anterior syndesmosis can be seen in low grade exorotation injuries. In this patient there is a full thickness tear of the anterior syndesmosis (yellow arrow). The\\nre is also a fracture of the malleolus tertius (blue arrow). More proximal, edema is seen around the membrana interossei. This patient had a Weber C fracture, which is a grade 4 pro\\nnation exorotation injury in the Lauge-Hansen classification.\\nPosterior syndesmosis:\\nAcute injury presents as edema and thickening, while an old injury presents with thickening and low signal intensity due to scar formation. In A there is edema and thickening around\\n the anterior and posterior syndesmosis (arrow), indicative of acute grade 2 injuries. In B there is edema and thickening of the posterior syndesmosis, which is an acute grade 2 inj\\nury. The anterior syndesmosis is also thickened but shows low signal. This is scar formation as a result of prior injury. In C there is scar tissue as a result of previous injury, w\\nhich again can be a cause of posterior impingement.\\nATFL:\\nThere are three ligaments on the lateral side: The ATFL runs from the lateral malleolus anteriorly to the lateral border of the talus. It has a transverse orientation and is best se\\nen on axial images. This is the most commonly injured ligament of the ankle and it is also the first to be injured on the lateral side. This means that when the CFL or the PTFL are \\ninjured, it is very likely that the ATFL is injured aswell.

Usually this is best appreciated on fatsat images. The patient in\\n the middle has thickening and architecture distortion representing a partial tear (grade 2). The patient on the right has a full thickness tear (grade 3). Bright rim sign This sign\\n presents as a fine linear band of high signal intensity which is the result of a small avulsion of cortical bone in a grade 3 full thickness tear. Here an example of a grade 3 ATFL\\n tear with a bright rim sign (arrow). It is thought that it is caused by a chemical shift artifact when subcortical fatty marrow is exposed to joint fluid.\\nCFL:\\nThe Calcaneofibular ligament runs from the distal fibula to the lateral side of the calcaneus and is best appreciated on coronal images. The CFL passes two joints, the talocrural jo\\nint and the talocalcaneal joint. Isolated injury of the CFL is uncommon. Most of the time the ATFL is injured as well.\\nPTFL:\\nThe Posterotalofibular ligament courses posterior to the lateral tubercle on the posterior aspect of the talus. Isolated injury is very rare. When it is injured, there has to be inj\\nury to the other lateral ligaments. Here a normal PTFL and a grade 2 tear. Notice that there is also a grade 2 tear of the ATFL. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nDeltoid ligament:\\nThe deltoid or medial ligament is more difficult to evaluate, since seven components have been described. Some components are always present, while others are variable and not alway\\ns seen on a standard MR. The deltoid ligament is best evaluated in the coronal plane. The deep layer connects the inferior border of the medial malleolus to the medial side of the t\\nalus. The fibers are interposed with fatty tissue, giving it a striped pattern on MR. The superficial layer of the deltoid ligament is connected to the navicular bone anteriorly and\\n the calcaneus posteriorly. At the insertion on the medial malleolus, it blends with the periosteum of the medial malleolus and the flexor retinaculum. Caudally, it is connected to \\nthe Spring ligament, which is the superomedial part of the calcaneonavicular ligament. This ligament serves as a hammock for the talus. The Spring ligament is oriented obliquely and\\n has a close relation with the deltoid ligament and the posterior tibial tendon. Surgical repair of the spring ligament is increasingly being recognized as an important management c\\nomponent of the adult-acquired flatfoot. These images show injury to the deep deltoid ligament. It is difficult to differentiate between grade 1 and 2 injuries, because the edema wi\\nll blur the normal striped pattern. The image on the right shows fiber discontinuity making it a full thickness or grade 3 tear. First look at the images. Then continue reading. The\\n findings are: On these images we can recognize the close relationship between the deltoid ligament and the periosteum of the medial malleolus and the flexor retinaculum. On the ima\\nge in the middle there is a deltoid ligament injury with separation of the periosteum or \"periosteal stripping\". In addition, the flexor retinaculum is thickened. On the image on th\\ne right there is thickening of the deltoid ligament with a low signal intensity as a result of chronic injury. Note that the periosteum and flexor retinaculum are also thickened. Th\\nickening of the periosteum is a common finding and indicates injury of the deltoid ligament in the past.\\nPlantar fascia:\\nThe plantar fascia is a thick aponeurosis which supports the arch on the plantar side of the foot. It runs from the tuberosity of the calcaneus to the heads of the metatarsal bones.\\n Plantar fasciitis, the most common cause of heel pain in the athlete, is a low-grade inflammation involving the plantar aponeurosis and the perifascial structures. MR can show edem\\na around the insertion of the plantar fascia on the calcaneus and spurring. When the patient is treated, the edema will vanish, but the spurring may still be present. Spurring as se\\nen on a X-ray therefore can be seen in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.\\nTendons:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nAnatomy in the axial plane:\\nThe tendons can be divided into four compartments: Tendinopathy is a collective term to describe different tendon disorders like tendinosis, tendinitis and mucoid degeneration. The \\npathogenesis of these disorders is different, but the clinical presentation and imaging features are not always distinctive. Therefore it is best just to describe a tendon abnormali\\nty as tendinopathy without trying to further specifying the abnormality. MR findings in tendinopathy are: Most tendons in the ankle joint have a tenosynovial layer. A small amount o\\nf fluid around the tendon therefore can be normal. The amount of fluid should not exceed the volume of the tendon itself. The achilles tendon does not have a tenosynovial layer but \\na paratenon. Fluid around the Achilles tendon is always abnormal.\\nPosterior tibial tendon:\\nThe posterior tibial tendon is the most commonly injured tendon. Tendinopathy is seen as abnormal swelling of the tendon, but you have to realize, that the normal posterior tibial t\\nendon can measure twice the size of the flexor digitorum tendon. Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction is more common in women and in people older than 40 years of age. It results in \\npain and swelling on the medial aspect of the ankle and an acquired flatfoot deformity. Posterior tibial tendon injury in young patients is mainly due to trauma or overuse. When the\\n posterior tibial tendon is injured, be sure to check the spring ligmanent, since they together maintain the arch of the foot on the medial side. In flat foot deformity both the ten\\ndon and the spring ligament can be injured. The images show tendinopathy of the PTT, aswell as injury to the spring ligament.\\nAchilles tendon:\\nThe Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the human body. The two most common injuries are tendinopathy and rupture. Achilles tendinopathy is most likely due to a s\\neries of microtears that weaken the tendon and cause swelling of the tendon (image on the right). On sagital images the achilles tendon should be a straight line without any fluid a\\nround it and no focal thickening. A transverse diameter of 8 mm is the cut off. Three fat sat axial images of the achilles tendon. Normal achilles tendon. Its border is concave, it \\nis within 7mm, no paratenon fluid is seen.\\n* Middle Normal achilles tendon. Note that the other tendons all contain fluid, but the achilles paratenon shows no fluid at all.\\n* Right Fluid alongside the paratenon, i.e. paratenonitis and achilles tendinopathy. Normally, a small amount of fluid is seen in the retrocalcanear bursa. Too much fluid is indicat\\nive of bursitis. Thickening of the Achilles is seen with paratenonitis. The Haglund syndrome consists of the triad of: This image shows fibrotic tissue anterior to the Achilles tend\\non (yellow arrow) after resection of a Haglund exostosis. This was the cause of continuing impingement. This image shows an extreme case of insertion tendinopathy of the Achilles te\\nndon. Another example of Achilles tendinopathy. Rupture of the Achilles tendon usually occurs in the part of the tendon situated within 6 centimeters of the insertion to the calcane\\nus. This part is prone to rupture because the blood flow in this area is poor, which also can impair its ability to heal. The image shows an old rupture.\\nPeroneal tendons:\\nThe peroneus brevis tendon is injury-prone, because it is positioned inbetween the fibula and peroneus longus tendon. As the foot undergoes dorsiflexion, the peroneus brevis tendon \\nis repeatedly compressed between the peroneus longus tendon and the lateral malleolus, predisposing to tear. Once a small tear is initiated, it will results in a cashew nut deformit\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"y. The peroneus longus tendon migrates forward into the peroneus brevis tendon tear, thereby preventing healing (figure). In the middle and right we see two examples of cashew nut d\\neformity, indicative of partial split rupture. This can be challenging, because the actual tear cannot be seen, only the architectural deformation. Split tears are associated with i\\nnversion injuries, most likely due to greater force on these tendons after ligamentous injury. Split tears of the peroneus longus are less common. They are associated with a promine\\nnt calcaneal tubercle. Anterior The extensor tendons are rarely injured. Tom Hates Dick is a useful mnemonic.\\nAccessory muscles:\\nAccessory muscles are frequently seen around the ankle joint. Since they have a normal signal intensity, they are easily missed. However when you compare the findings with the norma\\nl patient on the left, you will detect the big accessory soleus muscle. Some examples of accessory muscles. They are usually asymptomatic, but can be a cause of impingement in speci\\nfic patient groups (dancers, athletes). Accessory FHL or FDL are associated with tarsal tunnel syndrome. The patient on the right has a hypertrophic plantaris muscle. This can be a \\ncause of Achilles tendinopathy.\\nMRI protocol:\\nStandard axial, coronal and sagittal planes are used in the ankle both on 1.5T and in 3T. In addition to the standard planes, a oblique scan is sometimes included oriented perpendic\\nular to the peroneus and tibialis posterior tendons. Small tears or subtle tendinopathy are better visualized on these views. The orientation of the tendons along the medial and lat\\neral malleolus can cause the 'magic angle artifact' to occur. The tendons will show relatively hyperintense signal at 55* to B0), simulating pathology like tendinopathy or partial t\\nears. This artifact is visible on short TE images (f.e. PD). On long TE images (like T2) this artifact does also occur but less pronounced. by Kiley D. Perrich et al.

In this article we present a pictorial essay of neck masses in children and provide a diagnostic appro\\nach based on the location of the lesion and whether it is cystic or solid. Ultrasound is the imaging method of choice and in many cases a definite diagnosis is possible, especially \\nif the lesion is cystic. MRI is of value in large lesions, to determine whether the lesion infiltrates into deep spaces. CT is sometimes applied in acutely ill patients with infecti\\nons to assess whether an abscess is present. In suspected malignant lymphoma ultrasound can demonstrate which node is most accessible to image guided biopsy or excision, while PET/C\\nT is used for staging.\\nIntroduction:\\nDiagnostic approach:\\nIn a neck lesion in a child, ultrasound can usually determine whether a lesion is cystic or solid. Often more than one lymph node is enlarged. Try to differentiate between reactive \\nnodes, lymphadenitis due to TB or cat-scratch disease and malignant lymphoma.\\n* Solid - not a lymph nodeIf a solid lesion is not a lymph node look for a possible site of origin, like the salivary gland, the thyroid gland or the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sub\\ncutaneous solid lesions sometimes have a typical appearance, like pilomatrixomas, lipomas or hemangiomas. In many cases however a solid lesion will be non-specific and a diagnosis c\\nan only be made through biopsy or excision. Click on image to enlarge\\nLocation of cystic lesions:\\nOnce you have decided that the lesion is cystic its location will often point to its nature (figure). Midline lesions Midline lesions are either thyroglossal duct cysts, dermoid cys\\nts or ranulas. Older children can be asked to protrude their tongue. A thyroglossal duct cyst will move upward with the hyoid bone. Ranulas have a typical location in the floor of t\\nhe mouth. Off-midline lesions Off-midline lesions can be branchial cleft cysts or lymphangiomas. Branchial cleft cysts often contain debris. Anteriorly located lymphangiomas are oft\\nen multicystic. In the posterior neck they are often single.\\nCystic lesions:\\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. In neck lesions we first try to figure out whether a lesion is cystic or solid. In clear cystic lesions this is straightforward.\\n It can however be a problem if the cyst has been inflamed or when a cyst has bled, since children often present with a preexistent lesion that has bled. Try to elicit swirling of t\\nhe contents by compressive movements of the probe or by changing the position of the child and look for acoustic enhancement. The video shows a swelling, that appeared overnight in \\na 13-year-old girl. A hypo-echoic lesion is seen superficial to the carotid artery and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. No movement of the lesions content was seen when pinge\\nd with the probe. When the girl was asked to sit upright the contents swirled.\\nThyroglossal duct cyst:\\nThyroglossal duct cysts are common lesions in children. The thyroglossal duct runs from the base of tongue at the foramen caecum to the thyroid gland. The embryonic thyroid gland tr\\navels through the duct to reach its final normal position. Normally, the thyroglossal duct then involutes, but when the duct persists, a thyroglossal duct cyst can develop anywhere \\nalong this tract (figure). Thyroglossal duct cysts move upward if the tongue is protruded or during swallowing (see next movie). Ultrasound is usually sufficient to make the diagnos\\nis. Always look for the presence of a normal thyroid gland and make an image of it. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. This videoclip demonstrates the upward movem\\nent of the thyroglossal duct cyst together with the hyoid bone during swallowing. Thyroglossal duct cyst Thyroglossal duct cysts can be anechoic or hypo-echoic with internal echoes,\\n due to infection, hemorrhage, or proteinaceous content. The majority of thyroglossal duct cysts is located within 2 cm of the midline. Here a tranverse image of a hypoechoic thyrog\\nlossal duct cyst with some internal echoes located in the midline. Thyroglossal duct cyst Here a tranverse image of an anechoic thyroglossal duct cyst just left of the midline. Typi\\ncal hyper-echoic dermoid cyst in the suprasternal notch.\\nDermoid cyst:\\nDermoid cysts are inclusion cysts, that contain epithelium and skin adnexa like hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands. 7% of dermoid cysts occur in the head and neck reg\\nion, especially around the orbit and in the midline of the neck, with a predilection for the suprasternal notch. Here a typical homogeneous hyper-echoic oval lesion, representing a \\ndermoid cyst, which was located in its favorite location, the suprasternal notch. Dermoid cyst In the neck dermoid cysts are generally homogeneously hyperechoic, although they can b\\ne inhomogeneous. The differentiation from a thyroglossal duct cyst can be difficult if the dermoid cyst is located near the hyoid bone. The content of thyroglossal duct cysts is usu\\nally hypo-echoic and may contain internal echoes, while dermoid cysts generally have a more homogeneous hyper-echoic content. Here an unusual inhomogeneous appearance of a dermoid c\\nyst in front of the thyroid gland (figure). Orbital dermoid cyst The most common location of a dermoid cyst in the head-neck region is around the orbit, typically at the upper outer\\n corner. On ultrasound they are anechoic and one should look for the presence of a bony lining. If the integrity of the bony lining is uncertain, a CT or MRI is necessary to determi\\nne possible intracranial extension. Here a typical orbital dermoid cyst. It was firm on palpation and located at the lateral border of the orbit. On ultrasound it is anechoic with r\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n",

Cysts at the level of the thyroid gland can be remnants of the third or fourth branchial cleft. Incomplete obliterati\\non results in either a cyst (75%), a sinus or a fistula (25%). Cysts present as painless masses, sometimes appearing suddenly after internal hemorrhage. They are located along the a\\nnterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lateral to the common carotid artery, and if more cranially between the internal and external carotid artery. Sometimes a beak sign\\n may be seen as a curved rim of the lesion pointing medially between the internal and external carotid. Typical ultrasound appearance of a branchial cleft cyst with echogenic debris\\n. On ultrasound they often contains internal echoes caused by debris, which consists of cholesterol crystals. The cyst is usually compressible, which results in movement of the cont\\nent. This may not be the case in a cyst with a fresh internal hemorrhage. They can inflame and present with an empyema. Here another branchial cyst with a typical location superfici\\nal to the carotid artery bifurcation. Branchial sinuses Branchial sinuses are blind ending tracts, presenting anterior of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Branchial second arch fistu\\nlas end in the tonsillar fossa, as can be demonstrated with a contrast fistulogram or MRI. With ultrasound a tract can often be seen to travel upwards, but it is usually not possibl\\ne to depict the proximal ending. Here a two-year-old boy with a dirty spot in the right lower neck. A small tract could be seen to extend inwards. At operation a second branchial fi\\nstula was excised. Here a ten-year-old girl with a pit in the right neck, anterior of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. On US a long cystic lesion can be seen which can be traced up t\\no the right submandibular region. At operation, the fistula extended towards the right tonsillar fossa and was excised.\\nLymphangioma:\\nLymphangiomas are cystic lesions, caused by maldevelopment of the lymph channels. The majority occur in young children, with 90% in the head and neck region. In the posterior neck a\\n lymphangioma usually has one or more larger cysts. In the anterior neck a lymphangioma can consist of innumerable small cysts, and may infiltrate deeply into the neck or mediastinu\\nm. This is also called a hygroma colli. The sonographic appearance depends on the size and number of cysts. Larger cysts are mostly anechoic or may contain some debris. A microcysti\\nc lymphangioma can be hyper-echoic due to the high number of closely related reflecting walls. Here an ultrasound of a typical lymphangioma. MRI was performed because the extension \\nof the lesion was not clear. Here the T2-weighted image of the same patient. On T1-weighted images the content has a variable signal intensity, depending on its protein or blood con\\ntent. It generally has a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Contrast enhanced T1 can show enhancement of the wall. Here an ultrasound image of a six-year-old girl with a s\\nudden swelling in the left neck. There were several small anechoic cysts and one large cyst containing internal echoes, which were probably the result of a bleeding in a preexistent\\n lymphangioma. A 3-year-old boy presented suddenly with a supraclavicular mass. Ultrasound showed a lesion with echogenic debris. A hemorrhage in a preexisting lymphangioma was susp\\nected. Continue with the MRI. The T1-weighted image shows a slightly hyperintense lesion with a fluid-fluid level (arrow). After gadolineum administration there is enhancement of th\\ne cyst wall. The lesion subsided with conservative therapy. Ranula\\nRanula:\\nA ranula is a fluid filled cyst originating from the sublingual salivary gland. It can extend into the floor of the mouth and be visible on inspection of the oral cavity. It can als\\no extend through or over the mylohyoid muscle and is then called a \"plunging ranula\" and present as a submental or submandibular mass. Here an image of a sixteen-year-old boy with a\\n firm swelling under the tongue on the left side. Ultrasound showed an anechoic mass continuous with the sublingual salivary gland. Sorry, your browser doesn\\'t support embedded vide\\nos.\\nJugular ectasia:\\nIn some children a swelling can appear in the lower neck during straining. This is often caused by dilatation of the internal jugular vein as can easily be demonstrated by ultrasoun\\nd that will show the variations in caliber of the vein. An example is shown on the video of a seven-year-old boy, initially suspected of a laryngocele.\\nSolid lesions - Lymph nodes:\\nThis image shows a commonly used classification for the location of lymph nodes. Submental and submandibular nodes\\n* Level 2 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, above the level of the hyoid bone\\n* Level 3 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, between the hyoid bone and cricoid cartilage\\n* Level 4 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, below the cricoid cartilage\\n* Level 5 Posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the clavicles\\n* Level 6 Anterior to the thyroid gland Normal lymph nodes are always visible with ultrasound in children. A normal lymph node: The normal jugulodigastric node which is located belo\\nw the mandibular angle can have a short axis of 15 mm. Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck are very common in children. In most cases these are reactive nodes as a reaction to a nearby\\n infection. Less commonly it is due to a primary infection of the lymph nodes itself, which is called lymphadenitis. Usually the terms reactive lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis are\\n used synonymously. Although ultrasound cannot always reliably distinguish lymphadenitis from a malignant lymphoma, the following table can be helpful to decide whether an excision \\nbiopsy should be done or that a \"wait and scan\" policy can be adopted. Supraclavicular lymph nodes should always be considered to be malignant until proven otherwise.\\nReactive lymph nodes:\\nReactive lymph nodes are a reaction to nearby inflammation. They are slightly enlarged and more hypoechoic than normal with a broader echogenic center. Here a six-year-old boy with \\nweight loss, fatigue and lymphadenopathy. On ultrasound a string of enlarged lymph nodes with preservation of a echogenic hilum was seen. Excision biopsy showed reactive lymph nodes\\n. Here a two-year-old girl with a palpable swelling in the left neck since a few weeks. On ultrasound the lymph nodes are enlarged with preservation of the echogenic hilus and norma\\nl perfusion. It was decided to wait and see and the nodes slowly shrunk.\\nBacterial or viral lymphadenitis:\\nA bacterial or viral lymphadenitis is an infection of the node itself. Bacterial lymphadenitis is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or B-hemolytic Streptococcus. The nodes, whic\\nh are frequently located in the submandibular region, are painful and the skin is warm and red. Bacterial lymphadenitis has an acute onset and is usually unilateral. The ultrasound \\nimage is of a one-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck for three weeks. A partly liquefied lymphnode is seen with infiltration of the surrounding subcutaneous fat. The swelling \\ndisappeared on antibiotic treatment. Abscess formation is clinically difficult to detect, and ultrasound is also not reliable. Signs of liquefaction are areas with a detectable wall\\n and more hypoechoic center or areas with mobile, moving echoreflections. According to the literature there are 30% false-positive ánd false-negative results. Here a one-year-old bo\\ny with a swelling in the right neck for one week. Ultrasound shows an enlarged lymph node with areas of liquefaction. It was incised and drained, after which the infection subsided.\\nCat-scratch disease:\\nCat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae. The infection is the result of a scratch or bite of a cat. It is the most common cause of chronic axillary lymphadenopathy. The\\n symptoms are often mild and lymph node swelling can be prolonged. The clinical diagnosis can be difficult and PCR results are insensitive. On ultrasound the affected nodes are roun\\nd, heterogeneously hypoechoic, hypervascular, and with some surrounding inflammation. The nodes are a bit tender but not painful. They can be difficult to distinguish from malignant\\n nodes. Here an ultrasund image of a sixteen-year-old girl, who was treated for recurrence of acute lymphatic leukaemia. Six months after the last treatment, she developed a swellin\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"g in the left shoulder region. A hypoechoic node without any internal structure was seen. It was excised. The final diagnosis was, surprisingly, Bartonella henselae. Sorry, your bro\\nwser doesn't support embedded videos. Cat-scratch disease 2 Here a video of a fifteen-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck. There are multiple lymph nodes with surrounding infil\\ntrated tissue. Continue with next video. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. After a week suppuration was seen. Aspirated pus was positive for Bartonella henselae. \\nThe boy was successfully treated with antibiotics. Two-year-old boy with a progressive swelling in the neck. No effect of antibiotics. An atypical Mycobacterium infection (avium) wa\\ns confirmed. The anechoic parts (arrow) in the node are often seen in atypical Mycobacteria infection.\\nMycobacteria:\\nInfection with atypical Mycobacteria generally occurs in patients between one and five years of age. There are few clinical symptoms, most often only a palpable mass. The enlarged l\\nymph nodes are usually unilateral and in the pre-auricular or submandibular area. There is often a pronounced skin discoloration. Tuberculosis (TB) and atypical Mycobacteria frequen\\ntly present with a single enlarged node and some smaller satellite lesions. There is central necrosis, thickening of the overlying skin, surrounding inflammation and after a while a\\n confluent mass. Fistulas may be present. Calcifications are seen more commonly in TB infections than in atypical Mycobacterial infections, especially after treatment. Continue with\\n next image... Three months later the swelling is still present. The deeper lymphnode has liquefied. After another four months a lymph node had undergone liquefaction and discharged\\n in the surrounding tissue. Here an ultrasound image of a 6-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck. Fine calcifications are seen in the lymph node. The Mantoux and Qferon test wer\\ne positive, but cultures for tuberculosis were negative. The patient was treated with tuberculostatics with good result.\\nMalignant lymphoma:\\nMalignant lymphoma presents with painless lymphadenopathy. In Hodgkin lymphoma the cervical nodes are most commonly involved, while in non-Hodgkin lymphoma the nodes of the Waldeyer\\n ring are often involved. On ultrasound the affected nodes are round, homogeneously hypoechoic and the normal echogenic hilum is absent. The diagnosis is made by ultrasound-guided b\\niopsy or excision. PET/CT will demonstrate the extension of the disease. The images are of a fourteen-year-old boy with a painless swelling in the left neck. The ultrasound shows se\\nveral enlarged hypoechoic lymhnodes, that lack an hyper-echoic hilum. Here another fourteen-year-old boy with a painless swelling in the left neck. Ultrasound showed several enlarge\\nd lymhnodes. Continue with the MR and PET/CT... A coronal STIR image shows the pathologic lymph node masses similar to the PET-CT. The diagnosis was Hodgkin's lymphoma.\\nSolid lesions - not lymph nodes:\\nThe most common cause of a solid lesion in the neck is an enlarged lymph node as we just discussed. Other solid lesions in the neck are far less common. They are listed in the table\\n. In many cases the imaging findings in a solid lesion will be non-specific and a diagnosis can only be made through biopsy or excision.\\nThyroid lesions:\\nCongenital anomalies The most common anomalie is a partial or complete agenesis of the gland. In partial agenesis the gland is ectopic and located anywhere between the base of the t\\nongue and the thyroid cartilage. Mostly near or in the tongue, a lingual thyroid. Here an image of a newborn with an abnormal thyroid test. No thyroid gland is visible in the neck, \\nneither in its usual position nor higher up in the neck. Thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules are common. They can be single or multiple. Some are purely cystic but most are solid. On ul\\ntrasound they are isoechoic with the normal gland. In a goiter a multitude of solid nodules are seen. If there is concern about a possible malignancy fine needle aspiration can be d\\none. Preferably a technician of the cytology department is present to make a quick assessment of the retrieved cells to ascertain that thyroid cells are aspirated, and not only bloo\\nd. This is an ultrasound image of a six-year-old girl with a small cyst with a septum in the right thyroid lobe. It remained unchanged over a year. Hashimoto's thyroiditis: An enlar\\nged thyroid gland with a diffuse inhomogeneous structure and hyperemia is seen in a ten-year-old girl Thyroiditis The most common forms of thyroiditis are Hashimoto's thyroiditis an\\nd Graves disease. Both Hashimoto's thyreoiditis and Graves disease can present as an enlarged and hyperemic thyroid. Hashimoto's thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is an\\n auto-immune disease. It presents with hypothyroidism. Although primarily a disease of the middle-aged it can present in children. On ultrasound the gland is diffusely enlarged and \\ninhomogeneous. On color doppler the blood flow is often normal but can be increased like in Graves' disease. In a later stage the gland shrinks. Graves disease In Graves disease the\\n thyroid gland is also enlarged and shows an increased perfusion. On color Doppler it has been described as an inferno in red and blue. Here an image of a 16-year-old girl with hype\\nrthreoidism. A diffusely enlarged thyroid gland is seen with hyperemia. The final diagnosis was Graves disease. She was treated with I-131. Ultrasound image of the thymus in a two-m\\nonths-old boy.\\nThymus:\\nThe thymus is located in the upper mediastinum and can be visualized with a suprasternal scan plane. With increasing age its echogenicity increases and becomes more granular. Ultras\\nound is ideal to demonstrate the thymus as a cause of a widened upper mediastinum in infants. Sometimes the thymus causes a swelling in the suprasternal notch on straining. Such a h\\nerniating thymus can be demostrated with ultrasound. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. The thymus is located in the upper mediastinum and can be visualized with a\\n suprasternal scan plane. Ultrasound image of the thymus in an eight-year-old boy. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Here a video of a six-month-old boy with a ma\\nss which was sometimes visible in the suprasternal notch. While crying the thymus was seen to herniate in front of the trachea. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\\nEctopic thymus:\\nEctopic thymic tissue may occur anywhere along the path of descent through the thymopharyngeal duct. When it presents as a neck mass, it can be mistaken for a tumor. The ectopic par\\nt of the thymus has the same echo characteristics as the normal thymus. The video shows an ectopic thymic remnant, which was an incidental finding in the neck, detected on a MRI of \\nthe brain in a 2-year-old boy. The ectopic thymus has the ultrasound characteristics as the normal gland. Here images of a six-month old boy with a vocal cord paralysis. The MRI exa\\nmination shows a mass between the parotid and submandibular gland (yellow arrow). The signal characteristics are equal to the thymus (green arrow). Ultrasound confirmed an ectopic t\\nhymic remnant (yellow arrow), with identical sonographic characteristics as the orthotopic thymus (green arrow). Left: orthotopic thymus; right: ectopic thymus LEFT: normal sternocl\\neidomastoid muscle. RIGHT: Hyperechoic mass in sternocleidomastoid muscle.\\nFibromatosis colli:\\nFibromatosis collis is a swelling of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in a newborn. It is probably caused by pressure necrosis of the muscle during delivery. Contrary to common belief\\n it is not caused by hemorrhage. 50% of affected babies are born in breech. The swelling becomes apparent one to three weeks after birth. Sometimes a torticollis is noted. The swell\\ning will usually regress spontaneously within a few months. On ultrasound an enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is seen. It can affect the whole muscle or part of it. The\\n sternal head is always affected, and often the cleidal head as well. It can be hypo-, iso- or hyperechoic. Longitudinal images of the swelling will demonstrate its muscular origin.\\n Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Here a video of a two-month-old boy with a torticollis. A mass is seen within the enlarged sternocleidomastoid muscle. The diag\\nnosis is fibromatosis collis Hemangioma\\nVascular anomalies:\\nVascular anomalies are classified into proliferative vascular tumors and vascular malformations. This classification is important as the treatment is different. Some vascular tumors\\n will regress spontaneously or after administration of beta-blockers. Vascular malformations however need excision, sclerosing, or embolisation, if treatment is requested. The class\\nifications of these lesions is constantly changing and beyond the scope of this article. A recent article on vascular anomalies provides a new classification (2). Hemangioma Hemangi\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"omas are benign vascular neoplasms. They are the most common tumors of infancy. 60% of hemangiomas are seen in the head-neck regio. They usually appear in the first weeks after birt\\nh, show rapid growth, followed by spontaneous involution. Here we see images of a highly vascular lesion in the left submandibular region, which was present at birth. Three months l\\nater it had decreased in size. Infantile hemangioma A soft swelling was present on the side of the head in a six-week-old boy. It was small at birth and showed rapid growth. This is\\n typical for an infantile hemangioma. Venous malformation Venous malformation A six-month-old boy presented with a swelling in the left neck at birth. Several ultrasound examination\\ns could not differentiate between a hemangioma or a venous malformation. At six months of age, the ultrasound showed a lesion, which was mostly composed of vessels which increased i\\nn size on straining. On color Doppler the lesion showed increased flow while crying. The final diagnosis on imaging and on clinical examination was a venous malformation. Firm tumor\\n in the right temporal area of a 2-year-old boy. Ultrasound shows an echogenic lesion with a well demarcated wall and slight posterior shadowing, characteristic for a pilomatrixoma.\\nPilomatrixoma:\\nA pilomatrixoma or epithelial inclusion cyst of Malherbe is a benign skin lesion associated with hairfollicles. It presents as a firm, mobile, painless swelling. Sometimes a blue di\\nscoloration is present. They vary in size from a few millimetres to 3 centimetres. The majority occurs in the head and neck region. On ultrasound a pilomatrixoma presents as an oval\\n tumor lcated between the cutis and subcutis. It is hyperechoic, sometimes with calcification and acoustic shadowing. The wall is often hypoechoic and on color Doppler tiny vessels \\ncan be seen in the wall. These images are of a firm mass in the neck of a 17-year-old girl. A cytologic sampling was inconclusive. Ultrasound shows a typical pilomatrixoma, confirme\\nd at pathology after excision. Some perfusion in the wall of the pilomatrixoma is seen. Large pilomatrixoma on the upper arm of a 12-year-old girl.\\nSalivary glands:\\nEnlargement of the salivary glands can be diffuse or focal. Diffuse swelling mostly affects the parotid glands. If it is bilateral it can be caused by autoimmune diseases (like Sjög\\nren's disease) or infections (HIV). On ultrasound many small hypoechoic lesions are present. Unilateral swelling can be caused by a bacterial parotitis. Hemangioma is the most commo\\nn parotid gland tumor of childhood, which involute in the course of a few months.\\nTeratoma:\\nTeratomas of the neck are rare in children. Teratomas are composed of all three germ layers. They often present at birth. On ultrasound they are composed of solid and cystic parts a\\nnd often contain calcifications. They can have a close connection to the thyroid gland. If the extension is unclear MRI can be done. Here we see a midline tumor in the anterior neck\\n of a three-day-old boy. Calcifications and solid and cystic parts are seen. Pathology was compatible with a mature teratoma.\\nParaganglioma:\\nHere images of a 17-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck, thought to represent a branchial cleft cyst. An echogenic solid mass was seen with moderate perfusion on color doppler \\nexamination. No specific diagnosis could be made. The final pathologic diagnosis was a paraganglioma, a very uncommon finding in children.\\nNeurofibroma:\\nHere a large neurofibroma in the subcutaneous tissue in the neck of a 10-year-old boy with a known neurofibromatosis.\\nNeuroblastoma:\\nNeuroblastoma usually presents as an abdominal mass in young children. In the neck it accounts for 1-5% of neuroblastomas. On ultrasound a heterogeneously echogenic mass is seen, of\\nten with some calcifications (1). Here a ten-month-old girl with a lump in the neck. Ultrasound shows a inhomogeneous mass with some calcifications. There were also three enlarged l\\nymph nodes with calcifications. Imaging could not make a definitive diagnosis.

This review focusses on all the no\\nn-meniscal pathology of the knee. See the article entitled Knee MRI - meniscal pathology for the pathology of the meniscus. Interactive cases are presented in the menubar. by David \\nRubin and Robin Smithuis\\nLigaments:\\nMR-signs of ligament tear\\nAnterior Cruciate Ligament:\\nThe ACL has interesting anatomy. It is an intra-articular structure, but it is extra-synovial. The synovium folds over the ligament. So at arthroscopy they look through the synovium\\n. Sometimes when there is a tear ,the synovium layer is intact and only a hemorrhagic ACL is seen. The ACL is composed of 3-5 layers of fibers. Between the fibers there can be fat o\\nr synovium or sometimes a little bit of fluid. This explains why the ACL is not black on PD-images. Do not look at the ACL on PD-images because this may give a false impression of p\\nathology. Only look at the ACL on T2W-images and even on these images the ACL does not have to be entirely black. Criteria for the normal ACL are: So on MR the primary signs of a te\\nar are: discontinuity on T2, abnormal orientation or non-visualisation. Many secondary signs of tears have been described, but these are not helpfull, since we have to rely on direc\\nt visualisation of the ligament. Only bone bruises can be a helpfull secondary sign. Notice that on coronal and axial images fibers of the ACL are right next to the bone of the inte\\nrcondylar notch (arrows). There should never be any fluid between these ACL-fibers and the bone of the lateral condyle ('empty notch sign'). Also notice that the PCL is also compose\\nd of many fibers. LEFT: Acute ACL-tear. ACL fibers too flat compared to condylar roof.RIGHT: Discontinuity of fibers. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (2). The case on the left shows a li\\ngament that's too flat and we see disrupted fibers so there is abnormal orientation and discontinuity. Based on these images we cannot differentiate between complete tear, high grad\\ne partial tear or partial tear. MRI does not accurately differentiate between partial or complete ACL tear. But yes we can differentiate between high grade or low grade injury. A hi\\ngh grade injury is 'not able to see 50% of the fibers'. So if the othopaedic surgeons operate on a high grade injury, they will either find a totally torn ACL or a high grade partia\\nl tear, that needs to be repaired. On the other hand if most of the fibers appear to be intact on MR indicating a low grade ACL tear, they will find an intact or partially torn ACL,\\n that is stable and doesn't need any treatment. LEFT: ACL-tear with bone bruises on lateral side. RIGHT: Anterior condyle hits the posterior part of the tibia. ACL torn due to stret\\nching. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (3). Bone bruises appear in a very typical location indicating the dislocation, that was the cause of the ACL-tear. Segond fracture indicating ACL-\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"tear Anterior Cruciate Ligament (4) On X-rays an important indirect sign of an ACL-tear is a Segond fracture. Difficult to see on MR, but much more easy to see on radiographs. A Seg\\nond fracture is an avulsion fracture at the attachment of the lateral collateral band due to internal rotation and varus stress. In 75-100% there will also be a tear of the ACL. The\\n unhappy triad or O'Donoghues syndrome is a different combination of injuries. The unhappy triad injury commonly occurs in contact sports such as football when the knee is hit from \\nthe outside. This causes an injury to three knee structures: Torn ACL. ACL fibers are too flat (yellow arrow) compared to intercondylar roof (Blumensaat's line). Anterior Cruciate L\\nigament (5) Case on the left shows a torn ACL. Fibers have an abnormal orientation (too flat). Yet it is difficult to see if these are attached to the femur. The acute angulation in\\n the ligament is due to fact that the ACL and PCL have scarred together (see below). LEFT: ACL-fibers have a normal orientation but do not connect to femurcondyle. RIGHT: Empty notc\\nh sign: fluid against the interior part of the lateral condyle Sometimes it is easier to see whether these fibers are attached in the coronal plane. Against the interior part of the\\n lateral condyle there never should be fluid. If this is the case it is called the 'empty notch sign' indicating that the ACL is torn from it's attachment to the femur. In the axial\\n plane there is an empty notch sign (yellow arrows) where there should be ACL attached to the condyle. At a lower level (going right) the torn ACL is scarred to the PCL (green arrow\\ns) Also in the axial plane there should be ligament next to the condyle. At a lower level we see the torn ACL attached to the posterior cruciate ligament. They have scarred together\\n. This is a very common appearance of a chronic ACL tear. This scarring leads to the acute angulation of the ligament. Even though the ACL is connected to the PCL it is not strong e\\nnough and still needs reconstruction. ACL Mucoid degeneration. This patient had an operation for another reason and the surgeons called it normal because it looks normal. Anterior C\\nruciate Ligament (6) Case on the left shows a non-visualisation of the ACL on a PD-image. But the lesson is 'do not look at ligaments on a PD-image'. If you want to judge the ACL-li\\ngament look at the T2W-images. The T2W-images show fibers going all the way from the tibia to the femur with a normal orientation. So the ACL is intact. This is a case of mucoid deg\\neneration. Normally between the ACL-fibers there can be synovium or fat. In normal aging that can change into gelatinous material. This has no effect on the strenght of the ACL. ACL\\n Mucoid degeneration with cyst-formation (intra-osseus ganglion). Mucoid material is squeezed from between the ACL-fibers into the bone. At arthroscopy ACL and bone looked normal. A\\nnterior Cruciate Ligament (7) Another case of ACL Mucoid degeneration. Often this is associated with cyst-formation in the bone. You could call it ganglion cyst, but you could also \\ncall it normal because it has no clinical meaning. This is part of normal aging. ACL ganglion cyst Anterior Cruciate Ligament (8) Case on the left shows cyst seperate from ACL unlik\\ne mucoid degenaration. This is a ganglion cyst. Probably also a form of degeneration. The difference with Mucoid degeneration is that these cysts can be symptomatic. Sometimes these\\n cysts will drained under ultrasound guidance. Be sure to use a very large needle, because it is very thick material. Acute PCL-tear: In the coronal and axial plane most of the fibe\\nrs are gone so it's a high grade tear.\\nPosterior Cruciate Ligament:\\nWe use the same criteria for all the other ligaments in the body. The case on the left shows a high grade PCL tear. MCL from medial epicondyle (yellow arrow) to below the inferomedi\\nal geniculate vessels (red arrow) about 7 centimetres below the joint space.\\nMedial collateral ligament:\\nThe superficial medial collateral ligament (MCL) extends from the medial epicondyle to insert not just near the joint but 7 cm below the joint space. At that point there are three l\\nandmarks: the inferomedial geniculate artery and paired veins (figure). The deep part of the MCL, even when it is normal, you may not be able to see. It is closely applied to the me\\ndial meniscus and the superficial MCL. Grade 1 MCL Sprain Medial collateral ligament (2) The case on the left shows a Grade I sprain of the medial collateral ligament. Grade II MCL \\nSprain Medial collateral ligament (3) The case on the left shows a Grade II sprain of the medial collateral ligament. Superficial MCL-tear (yellow arrow) and deep MCL tear (orange a\\nrrow). Medial collateral ligament (4) The case on the left shows a superficial MCL that is torn from it's attachment on the tibia. Remember it should be attached 7 cm below the join\\nt line. Deep MCL is also torn the ligament is absent. Posterolateral corner anatomy from medial to lateral on sagittal images. Fibular collateral ligament (green) and Biceps femoris\\n tendon (yellow) form a letter V and insert as conjoined tendon on fibular head.\\nPosterolateral Corner injury:\\nNormal anatomy Posterolateral corner contains seven or eight structures. Only three of them are important to us because they are visible on MR and because the surgeon might want to \\nfix them. These structures are: Fibular collateral ligament Biceps femoris muscle and tendon. Popliteal tendon The fibular collateral ligament together with the tendon of the biceps\\n femoris form the letter V on sagittal images. They inserts on the fibulahead as the conjoined tendon. LEFT: bone bruise anteromedial. RIGHT: biceps femoris tendon is not attached t\\no the fibula. Posterolateral corner injury (2) On the left a football player, who was hit in the front part of the knee. The image on the far left shows a bone bruise anteromedially\\n. So you suspect ligamentous injury on the contralateral side, which is the posterolateral corner. The next image shows a normal popliteus tendon but biceps femoris tendon is not at\\ntached to the fibula. LEFT: distal rupture of fibular collateral ligament.RIGHT: biceps femoris tendon and collateral ligament do not attach. On the left more images of the same pat\\nient located more anteriorly. The fibular collateral ligament has a normal proximal attachment but is not attached to the fibula. On a sagittal plane there is a gap between biceps f\\nemoris tendon and collateral ligament on one side and the fibular head on the other. These findings indicate a conjoined tendon rupture. LEFT: cruciate lig.rupture (orange), med col\\nl lig rupture (green), proximal rupture of the fibular collateral ligament (blue).RIGHT: no attachment of popliteus tendon (red arrows) Posterolateral corner injury (3) On the left \\nPD-fatsat images after severe injury. There are bone bruises and many ligaments are ruptured. There is a posterolateral corner injury with proximal rupture of the fibular collateral\\n ligament. There is also a rupture of the popliteus tendon because it is not attached proximally.\\nCysts, Bursae and Recesses:\\nLEFT: popliteal cyst originating between semimembranosus tendon (red arrow) and gastrocnemius muscle and tendon (green arrow).RIGHT: ruptured popliteal cyst with fluid tracking down\\n the muscles. There are about 12 named bursae and recesses in the knee. Some very common and others uncommon. These are synovial lined structures. The most common recess is the popl\\niteal or Baker's cyst. The origin is between the semimembranosus and gastrocnemius tendon. Prepatellar bursitis\\nPrepatellar bursitis:\\nOn the left the typical imaging findings of prepatellar bursitis. Deep infrapatellar bursitis\\nDeep infrapatellar bursitis:\\nAn uncommon form of bursitis is the deep infrapatellar bursitis. Sometimes associated with Osgood-Schlatter. Medial collateral ligament bursitis located between the deep MCL (yellow\\n arrow) and the superficial MCL (green arrow). These bursae are all named by the structures next to them. So a bursitis of the bursa between the deep MCL and the superficial MCL is \\ncalled a medial collateral ligament bursitis. Iliotibial Band Friction syndrome: no fat between iliotibial band (yellow arrow) and the lateral condyle. Cysts, Bursae and Recesses (2\\n) Adventitial bursae are bursae, that are formed in places where normally there is no bursa> The bursa is formed due to abnormal friction. Iliotibial Band Friction syndrome A common\\n place for abnormal friction is between the iliotibial band and the lateral condyle in speedwalkers, bicyclists and sometimes runners. When a bursa is formed in this location it is \\ncalled the 'Iliotibial Band Friction syndrome'. On the left a speedwalker with lateral knee pain.

Patellar tendon (blue arrow) and quadriceps tendon have a sharp posterior demarcation. Normal \\nExtensor mechanism The extensor mechanism of the knee is composed of the quadriceps muscle and tendon, the patella and the patellar tendon. The quadriceps tendon is made of four ten\\ndons but comes in three layers on sagittal images. It has a broad attachment all the way from the front of the patella almost to the back. The tendons of the quadriceps aswell as th\\ne patellar tendon are homogeneous in signal but don't have to be black on PD-images. They have a sharp posterior demarcation. There should be no focal thickness. Partial quadriceps \\ntendon tear: T2W-images.LEFT: Abnormal attachment of tendon.RIGHT: Most of tendon is retracted (red arrow) deep part (vastus intermedius) is still intact. Quadriceps tendon tear The\\n case on the left shows an abnormal quadriceps attachment. There is only one layer and the attachment does not go from the front of the patella to nearly the back. In such a case ex\\ntra images higher up have to be made after repositioning of the coil to see what's going on up there. The missing part of the torn quadriceps tendon is retracted. The deep part is s\\ntill intact LEFT: Torn tendon with pre-existing tendinopathy (red arrow). RIGHT: Intact vastus intermedius tendon. Same patient, axial images. The torn quadriceps tendon is very thi\\nck indicating tendinopathy. Normal tendons do not tear, so always look for signs of pre-existing tendinopathy. Anywhere in the body, if you see a tendon that looks torn, but there i\\ns no pre-existing tendinopathy, think hard, if you really have the right diagnosis. An image below this level shows normal vastus intermedius muscle and tendon. LEFT: Partial quadri\\nceps tear. Only rectus femoris tendon is torn (blue arrow).

In children we have a different situation. They don't develop tendinopathy. The case on the left shows images of a girl who had pain beneath the p\\natella after doing gymnastics. Although the X-ray is normal there accually is a fracture through the cartilage part of the lower pole. On MR it looks just like the jumper's knee abo\\nve. Only on coronal images the dark fractureline within the bright cartilage is visible. Usually these fractures are sutured. When these lesions are unrecognized they heal with ossi\\nfication just below the patella.\\nPatellar dislocation:\\nNormal anatomy The patellar cartilage is the thickest in the body. It should have smooth contours. The most important part of the medial retinaculum is the medial patellofemoral lig\\nament which inserts all the way posteriorly just in front of the MCL. LEFT: Bone bruise lateral condyle (yellow circle). Normal MCL (green arrow) but missing patellar femoral ligame\\nnt anterior to it.RIGHT: Medial patellar femoral ligament thorn from femoral attachment. Case on the left is a female soccerplayer who twisted her knee. Four MR-images from caudal t\\no cranial demonstrate all the imaging features of a patellar dislocation with rupture of the medial patellar femoral ligament . The patella was dislocated and the medial facet has b\\numped onto the lateral condyle. The patella has spontaneously reduced. LEFT: Bone bruise medial patella (green arrow).RIGHT: Cartilage fracture. Bone bruise may be complicated by ca\\nrtilage fracture. Patellar dislocation (2) Patellar dislocation is a common condition, but clinically often unrecognized because the patella after the dislocation comes back in it's\\n normal position. The patient comes with a swollen painfull knee which could be anything from ACL-, MCL- or meniscal tear to a fracture. So the MRI-findings are important in recogni\\nzing this condition. Patients who have loose bodies or continuing dislocation may undergo operation with retinaculum repair.\\nBone and Cartilage:\\nNormal and abnormal bone marrow:\\nIn adults the bone marrow is largely composed of fat. Normal islands of red marrow may produce confusing images. Red bone marrow can be pronounced in young women, cigarette smoking,\\n high altitude, hemoglobinopathy or for no reason at all. As long as the criteria on the left are fullfilled it is normal. Normal red marrow on the left. Restricted to the metaphysi\\ns and not into the epiphysis. Comes in islands. On T1 brighter than muscle. Patient with leukemia and abnormal bone marrow Abnormal Bone Marrow Case on the left shows abnormal bone \\nmarrow. On T1W the signal intensity is lower than muscle. On T2W-images the signal is very bright. The abnormal signal comes into the epiphysis. Abnormal bone marrow. There is abnor\\nmal signal intensity in the form of circles in metaphysis and epiphysis. Another case with abnormal marrow. In this case the marrow is too dark on T1 and T2 due to iron deposition i\\nn the marrow after many blood transfusions in a patient with hemosiderosis. Avascular Necrosis: fluid underneath the cartilage just like a crescent sign on a X-ray. Cartilage is nor\\nmal.\\nAvascular Necrosis:\\nThe most common marrow abnormality is Avascular Necrosis (AVN). Some people will say 'AVN, Osteochondrosis Dissecans and Stress fracture all look the same'. There is however a disti\\nnct difference. AVN has the following features: Focal abnormality is subchondral and originates in the bone. Normal cartilage (until it collapses). Wedge shaped marrow edema due to \\nbone infarction. Wedge-shaped bone infarction in AVN The wedge-shaped pattern of bone marrow edema is just the same as any other infarction in the body i.e. liver infarction or kidn\\ney-infarction.\\nInsufficiency fracture:\\nOn the left a different entity, but the patient had the same symptoms. Acute onset of medial pain. There is diffuse marrow edema on T2W-image. On T1W-image the focal abnormality is \\nnot directly subchondral. The abnormality on the T1 is more inside the edema. On the T1W-image a dark line is visible indicating a insufficiency fracture. This patient will get bett\\ner with no weight bearing. On the left another patient with knee pain after trauma. There is some effusion but otherwise the x-rays are normal. Tibiaplateau fracture. This also is a\\n osteochondral fracture as the fracture line extends all the way through the cartilage to the joint surface. In the same patient the MRI shows an obvious tibiaplateau fracture. The \\npoint is that any patient who is unable to bear weight in the hip, knee or ankle with normal X-rays needs another study. Unstable Osteochondritis Dissecans\\nOsteochondritis Dissecans:\\nThe diagnosis Osteochondritis Dissecans is usually made on X-rays. The question for MRI is whether it is stable or unstable. The case on the left is unstable for two reasons: small \\ncysts at the base of the lesion (red arrow) even more important is fluid at the base of the lesion (blue arrow) Notice that this layer of fluid is different from AVN where the fluid\\n is between the cartilage and the bone. Unstable Osteochondritis Dissecans. The only helpfull sign for the diagnosis unstable OD is the fluid (yellow arrow) not the edema nor the br\\neak in the osteochondral surface (green arrow). Not helpfull for the discussion stable versus unstable OD are bone marrow edema (could be stable or unstable) break in the osteochond\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 59}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='ral surface. So the case on the left is unstable because there is fluid at the base of the lesion. The case on the left shows a OD with bone marrow edema and a break in the osteocho\\nndral surface. But since there is no fluid we cannot tell if this is stable or unstable. At operation the OD was found to be stable In those cases where you cannot tell whether the \\nlesion is stable or unstable MR-arthrogram is helpfull. We look for Gadolineum tracking around the osteochondral lesion.\\nNone:\\nNone:\\nNone:\\nPulmonary Fibrosis:\\nA stepwise approach to fibrosis on HRCT:\\nOnno Mets, Lilian Meijboom and Robin Smithuis\\nRadiology department of the Amsterdam University Medical Center and Alrijne hospital Leiderdorp:\\nPublicationdate 1-7-2021 In this article we will discuss lung diseases with a reticular pattern and provide a guidance for radiologists to evaluate the most common diseases and thei\\nr patterns. \\nA stepwise approach is presented to identify the key features in fibrotic lung disease and to make it easier to reach a differential diagnosis. Images can be enlarged by clicking on\\n them. We would like to thank Nestor L. Müller for his comments on the\\nmanuscript draft.\\nLung anatomy:\\nLung anatomy showing secondary lobules and the axial and peripheral interstitium. The anatomy of reticular lung disease is all about the pulmonary interstitium, which is a continuum\\n that comprises both a peripheral and axial component (fig). The peripheral interstitium supports the distal secondary lobules and involves the subpleural and perifissural areas, wh\\nereas the axial interstitium supports the bronchovascular structures from the hilum towards the periphery. The interstitium also contains the lung lymphatics. Under normal circumsta\\nnces the interstitium itself is below the resolution of CT.\\nThickening of the interstitium is the underlying mechanism of a reticular pattern. The Fleischner glossary of terms [1] defines reticulation as “a collection of innumerable small li\\nnear opacities that, by summation, produces an appearance resembling a net”.\\nStepwise Approach:\\nThe\\nfirst step is to determine whether reticulation really represents fibrosis. The\\nnext step is to determine if it is definite, probable or indeterminate UIP\\npattern, or an alternative pattern. If\\nit is definite or probable UIP, one needs to realize that not all UIP equals\\nidiopathic lung fibrosis, as UIP with/without honeycombing can also be seen in\\nfibrotic sarcoid, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and end stage connective\\ntissue disease related-ILD (CTD-ILD).\\nStep 1 - Is it really fibrosis?:\\nClick to enlarge Fibrosis causes traction on surrounding structures and will lead to: Hence, these are the first features to look for when assessing whether the reticulation represe\\nnts lung fibrosis or not. The images show fibrotic lung disease with distortion of the secondary lobule, volume loss and traction bronchiectasis (green is normal, yellow is abnormal\\n). Pulmonary edema (A), Lymphangitic carcinomatosa (B), EGPA (C). Not\\nall reticulation is fibrosis, as the pulmonary interstitium can be thickened by\\nother pathology. Most\\ncommonly this is: The\\nimages show examples of non-fibrotic reticulation due to interstitial\\nthickening in pulmonary edema (A), lymphangitic carcinomatosis (B), and\\neosinophilic infiltration in eosinophilic granulomatis with polyangitis [EGPA,\\nformer Churg-Strauss syndrome] (C).\\nILA -interstitial lung abnormalities:\\nIncidental mild interstitial changes – in patients clinically not suspected of ILD – have been named ‘interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA)’. These indeterminate and minor changes m\\nay represent an early stage of fibrotic interstitial lung disease, but may also just represent some post-infectious scarring or mild smoking- or age-related interstitial changes. A \\ncut-off of 5% lung involvement has been suggested as a discriminator for significant disease [2], however, accurate visual assessment is very difficult. Follow-up may show whether o\\nr not it is a relevant incidental finding, which is optional and depending on patient characteristics.\\nStep 2 – UIP pattern:\\nA\\nUIP pattern is based on the disease gradient, distribution of the fibrosis and\\nabsence of another dominant HRCT pattern. Another\\nHRCT pattern like ground-glass, lung cysts, centrilobular or perilymphatic\\nnodules and consolidation should be absent, since these are associated with\\nother underlying disease and point away from a UIP/IPF diagnosis. First the fibrosis has to show a gradient towards the lung bases, with the lower lobes and costophrenic angles more\\n extensively involved than the mid and upper lung zones. The fibrosis may be somewhat more anterior in the mid/upper lung zones, which has been named the ‘propeller sign’, after the\\n twist that is present in a propeller blade. The images show a basal and subpleural dominant pattern in A versus an apical and central dominant fibrotic disease in B. Subpleural dom\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='inant (A), subpleural sparing (B), and peribronchial dominant (C) patterns of fibrosis. Second, the fibrosis has to be subpleural dominant. This means that the disease targets the p\\neripheral interstitium and involves the lung directly beneath the pleura.\\nIt should not spare the subpleural lung tissue, nor should it centre around the bronchovascular bundle (ie. predominantly involve the axial interstitium).\\nUIP classification:\\nThere are specific imaging guidelines for UIP/IPF evaluation - issued by both a collaboration of worldwide Thoracic Societies (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT) as well as by the Fleischner Society\\n [3,4]. \\nThe bottom line of both guidelines is that HRCT imaging should reach a conclusion of either: In a patient with basal and subpleural dominant fibrosis, without inconsistent ancillary\\n features, the presence or absence of honeycombing determines whether to assign a definite or probable UIP pattern. \\nHowever, honeycombing assessment may suffer from substantial interobserver variability, even among experts [5]. \\nHoneycombing on CT imaging is defined as “subpleural oriented clustered cystic air spaces, typically on the order of 3-10 mm”. \\nNote is made that it is different from the honeycombing seen on histopathology, which is defined as “destroyed and fibrotic lung tissue containing numerous cystic airspaces with thi\\nck fibrous walls, with complete loss of acinar architecture” [1].\\nAlthough both represent established and severe fibrosis, they are seen at significantly different levels of magnification. Definite UIP (A) and probable UIP (B). In A there is honey\\ncombing combined with basal and subpleural dominant fibrosis indicating a definite UIP pattern. In B there is a probable UIP pattern without honeycombing. The ongoing process of hon\\neycombing formation. There is a spectrum ranging from normal lung tissue (A), through distortion of the secondary lobule with traction bronchiolectasis (B), to end stage cyst format\\nion (C). Honeycombing\\nis the result of progressive fibrosis with architectural distortion and is at\\nthe end of the scale from normal lung tissue, through distortion of the\\nsecondary lobule with traction bronchiolectasis, to end stage cyst\\nformation. Although\\nthe presence of honeycombing defines the difference between a probable and\\ndefinite UIP pattern, honeycombing is not pathognomonic for idiopathic pulmonary\\nfibrosis (IPF) as it is just a feature of severe fibrosis. Honeycombing\\nmay also be present in the fibrotic (end-)stages of sarcoidosis, NSIP and\\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis. In short, a UIP pattern does not equal IPF. But,\\nin the correct clinical setting ina patient clinically suspected of idiopathic\\npulmonary fibrosis (IPF) a UIP pattern will seal the case (ie. diagnosis of\\nUIP/IPF), eliminating the need for further invasive diagnostics like cryo- or\\nsurgical lung biopsy.\\nStep 3 - Alternative Patterns:\\n- Axial and non-basal distribution:\\nAxial and non-basal distribution When\\nthe interstitial disease is not mainly subpleural but rather predominantly\\nperibronchial, the two main considerations are fibrotic chronic hypersensitivity\\npneumonitis (HP) and sarcoidosis. Apical\\ndominance is often seen in sarcoidosis, but only in a minority of cases of\\nchronic HP. Typical fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis showing diffuse non-basal dominant (A), peribronchial orientated ground-glass and mild fibrotic changes with mosaicism (A a\\nnd B), and expiratory air trapping (C).\\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis:\\nTypical\\nfibrotic chronic HP is characterized by peribronchial fibrosis with various\\ndegrees of ground-glass and marked mosaic attenuation due to sparing of\\nsecondary lobules. Expiratory\\nair trapping due to small airways obstruction is a hallmark finding. Centrilobular\\nground-glass nodules may be present, but are more often and dominantly seen in\\nthe subacute (non-fibrotic) stages of the disease. The\\nfibrosis may show a random or diffuse distribution, or a mid- or upper lung\\npredominance with relative sparing of the bases. Fibrotic sarcoidosis with peribronchovascular and apical dominant disease\\nSarcoidosis:\\nSarcoidosis\\nis the great mimicker. The\\nfibrosis in sarcoidosis typically shows peribronchovascular and mid to upper\\nlung zone predominance with architectural distortion and central traction bronchiectasis,\\na varying amount of reticulation and, occasionally, even honeycombing. While\\nsarcoidosis initially typically manifests with bilateral hilar and mediastinal\\nlymphadenopathy, in the late fibrotic stage of the disease the nodes are usually\\nnormal in size and calcified. The\\nimages show typical fibrotic sarcoidosis with peribronchovascular and apical\\ndominant disease, showing (confluent) nodularity, reticulation and mild ground-glass, as well as extensive traction bronchiectasis.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='- Ground-glass pattern and Consolidation:\\nGround-glass Although some ground-glass may be seen in areas of reticulation – a finding that does not exclude the diagnosis of probable UIP pattern - dominant ground glass componen\\nt suggests an alternative diagnosis. Ground-glass may point to a wide range of diseases, including connective tissue disease (CTD) related ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, as well\\n as smoking-related and drug-related ILD.\\nGround-glass is often a feature of non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. Pure ground-glass without fibrotic changes is the hallmark feature of cellular NSIP, separated\\n from fibrotic NSIP pattern in which there is reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion due to fibrosis. NSIP is typically basal dominant with marked groun\\nd-glass, reticulation and traction bronchiolectasis. Subpleural sparing of the dorsal regions of the lower lobes is present in (only) approximately 40% of cases and may be a helpful\\n feature in making the diagnosis. Consolidations Consolidations are not part of a probable UIP pattern. Small focal areas of fibrosis may be seen in UIP, however, more significant c\\nonsolidation in HRCT imaging is often due to organizing pneumonia component and suggests a diagnosis other than UIP/IPF.\\nActive pulmonary infection or malignancy should always be considered.\\nConnective tissue disease related ILD:\\nThe table shows the imaging patterns in connective tissue disease related interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD), where font size correlates to imaging pattern frequency. CTD-ILD can r\\nesult in many different patterns.\\nWithin the overall heterogeneous group, disease manifestation with NSIP pattern as well as other components such as arcade-like consolidations due to OP (organizing pneumonia) or cy\\nsts due to LIP (lymphoid interstitial pneumonia) may hint toward a specific diagnosis (see Table). NSIP in Sjögren’s disease\\nNSIP:\\nClassic\\nfibrotic NSIP pattern in Sjögren’s disease with\\nfibrotic changes and dominant ground-glass in a basal dominant pattern that\\nextends somewhat more centrally. Subpleural\\nsparing is not a dominant feature in this case. ibrotic NSIP in anti-synthetase syndrome The images show a combination of basal dominant groundglass and traction bronchiectasis, com\\nbined with limited perilobular arcade-like consolidations due to co-existing organizing pneumonia (OP). The final diagnosis was fibrotic NSIP in anti-synthetase syndrome. Anti-synth\\netase syndrome is an immune-mediated multisystem disorder that can include (among others) interstitial lung disease, myositis and/or polyarthritis, skin changes and Raynaud’s phenom\\nenon. UIP pattern in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\nRheumatoid Arthritis:\\nSevere fibrotic changes in a subpleural and basal dominant orientation, with extensive honeycombing, consistent with a UIP pattern due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatoid arthr\\nitis can show multicompartment involvement and result in airways disease, pleural disease and interstitial lung disease, most commonly with a UIP pattern.\\nSmoking-related ILD:\\nSmoking-related interstitial lung disease is a difficult subgroup which typically shows profound emphysema with milder superimposed fibrotic changes, more diffuse or apical dominant\\n abnormalities, less severe basal volume loss and more ground-glass when compared to (probable) UIP pattern. However, smoking-related changes of the lung often coincides with other \\ninterstitial lung disease as a substantial number of ILD patients are (former) smokers. Smokers rarely suffer from chronic HP, while it is an individual risk factor for UIP/IPF.\\nSmoking-related interstitial fibrosis (SRIF) and combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) are regularly used terms, however, as radiological patterns not strictly defined.\\nDrug-induced ILD:\\nDrug-induced interstitial lung disease is a difficult subgroup with often non-specific imaging features.\\nIt should always be considered in every differential diagnosis, especially in cases showing a non-UIP pattern.\\nClassically, drug-induced ILD is associated with dominant ground-glass and/or organizing pneumonia consolidation pattern, more than frank fibrosis. Methotrexate, Amiodarone and Nitr\\nofurantoin are well-known examples of pneumotoxic drugs, although a near endless list has been recognized.\\nCompared to the past decades, the increasing use of immunotherapy will likely lead us to encountering drug-induced pneumonitis patterns more often.\\nSee www.pneumotox.com for more information on pneumotoxic drugs and their reported associated imaging patterns.\\nRadiologically non-classifiable disease:\\nNot uncommonly HRCT findings do not conform to one of the well known radiological patterns. \\nThis may be due to limited and nonspecific interstitial changes, or due to a combination of features that are truly indeterminate. \\nFor example, there may be subpleural dominant reticulation and traction bronchiectasis, but without a clear gradient or questionable groundglass component and no other ancillary fin\\ndings to suggest a specific diagnosis. It is often felt to be an act of weakness to not conclude on an imaging pattern, however, it is stressed that “radiologically non-classifiable\\n disease” is also a valid conclusion of the HRCT report. \\nIn fact, it is much better than “possibly UIP, differential NSIP or HP”.\\nMultidisciplinary approach:\\nDiagnosing a classic disease based on typical imaging findings is not that common. \\nInstead, it is more common to have a differential diagnosis as imaging features may be nonspecific. \\nIn a multidisciplinary team imaging findings can be correlated to clinical information, pulmonary function test, lab results, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsy findings to reac\\nh a consensus diagnosis and treatment plan.\\nClinical information:\\nDuring\\nthe evaluation of an ILD patient clinical information is gathered (table) Despite\\nthat for example over 200 agents have been associated with chronic\\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis, yield of occupational and environmental exposure\\nanalysis is unfortunately often limited.\\nPulmonary Function Tests:\\nA basic understanding of pulmonary function test mechanics is helpful. \\nThere are three major components in lung function testing: Index parameters in static lung volume assessment are: Typically, lung volumes are decreased in restrictive lung disease (\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"eg. lung fibrosis, neuromuscular disease) and increased in obstructive lung disease (eg. COPD, asthma). DLCO measures the capacity for carbon monoxide gas exchange, and is a surroga\\nte marker for the ability of oxygen to be delivered to the blood. \\nDLCO is directly proportional to the alveolar-capillary membrane surface area and inversely proportional to alveolar-capillary membrane thickness. \\nTypically, DLCO is decreased in diseases that either lower the membrane surface area (eg. emphysema, thromboembolic disease) or thicken the membrane over which diffusion takes place\\n (eg. lung fibrosis). The classic PFT pattern in lung fibrosis is restrictive, showing relatively normal spirometry with decreased lung volumes and DLCO.\\nHowever, a mixed pattern can be seen if patients who have both restrictive and obstructive disease components. \\nFor example, advanced stages of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis or sarcoidosis may show both small airway disease and lung fibrosis simultaneously. \\nAlso, summative contributions of emphysema and fibrosis in ‘combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema’ (CPFE) may lead to ‘pseudo-normalisation’ of spirometry and lung volumes, whil\\ne clinical symptoms and DLCO are usually profoundly abnormal.\\nLaboratory analysis:\\nThe search for inflammatory markers and auto-antibodies are part of standard ILD evaluation. \\nIt is important to realize that the presence of an auto-antibody does not equal a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease. \\nRather, a positive serology helps to support a diagnosis if accompanied by appropriate clinical signs and symptoms. Common biomarkers are:\\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL):\\nImmunologic BAL is a diagnostic procedure to retrieve respiratory secretions.\\nThere is limited value of BAL results in UIP/IPF diagnosis, other than exclusion of other underlying aetiologies.\\nPathology:\\nIf there is still no diagnosis after clinical evaluation, CT imaging and additional diagnostic tests, the MDT may decide that a lung biopsy is needed. \\nThis is however highly dependent on the patient’s wishes, co-morbidities and the available treatment options, as the procedure carries a relative high risk of complications and mort\\nality. Most often a video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) surgical lung biopsy is performed, in which typically three samples are taken from each lobe of the right lung. \\nA more recent option is an endoscopic cryobiopsy, however, yield is often suboptimal compared to surgical biopsies. The final diagnosis of IPF is based on the findings on HRCT in co\\nmbination with the histopathology (table).\\nTreatment and follow-up:\\nILD patients are most often followed with PFT and HRCT imaging to assess for disease progression. \\nDepending on the final diagnosis, medical therapy may be available. \\nA dichotomous split of therapeutic options is anti-fibrotic medication (in primarily fibrotic lung disease such as IPF) vs. immunosuppressive therapy (in immune-mediated fibrotic lu\\nng disease such as chronic HP or CTD-related ILD). Medication may be combined with termination of exposure to antigens or pneumotoxic drug, smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitati\\non, etc. A lung transplantation may be the ultimate endeavour, if available.\\nEsophagus II: Strictures, Acute syndromes, Neoplasms and Vascular impressions.:\\nTerrence C.

Corrosive ingestion\\n Corrosive ingestion can result in multiple strictures.\\nAcute esophageal syndromes:\\nIn the table on the left are etiologies of an acute esophageal syndrome.\\nBoerhaave syndrome:\\nBoerhaave syndrome is rupture of the esophageal wall. It is most often caused by excessive vomiting in eating disorders such as bulimia although it may rarely occur in extremely for\\nceful coughing or other situations, such as obstruction by food. Boerhaave syndrome is a transmural or full-thickness perforation of the esophagus, distinct from Mallory-Weiss syndr\\nome, a nontransmural esophageal tear also associated with vomiting. These syndromes are distinct from iatrogenic perforation, which accounts for 85-90% of cases of esophageal ruptur\\ne, typically as a complication of an endoscopic procedure, feeding tube, or unrelated surgery. This image is of a patient with Boerhaave syndrome. Chest radiographs show pneumomedia\\nstinum (arrows). Esophagram with extravasated water soluble contrast material in left hemithorax (asterisk) Perforation is almost always on the left side of distal esophagus. Radiog\\nraphs show mediastinal gas, effusion, and later pneumothorax. Esophagram is used to confirm leak, first with water-soluble contrast, then barium if no leak is demonstrated. Boerhaav\\ne's syndrome On the left a patient with Boerhaave syndrome. The barium study shows extraluminal gas (arrow) without contrast extravasation. CT shows extraluminal gas (arrows). Rent \\nof distal left esophagus confirmed at surgery. CT can show small amounts of extraluminal gas or extravasation not visible on radiographs or esophagram.\\nMallory-Weiss tear:\\nA Mallory-Weiss tear results from prolonged and forceful vomiting, coughing or convulsions. Typically the mucous membrane at the junction of the esophagus and the stomach develops l\\nacerations which bleed, evident by bright red blood in vomitus, or bloody stools. It may occur as a result of excessive alcohol ingestion. This is an acute condition which usually r\\nesolves within 10 days without special treatment.

Esophageal leiomyoma\\nLeiomyomas:\\nLeiomyomas are the most common benign esophageal neoplasm and are often large yet nonobstructive. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are least common in the esophagus. On the le\\nft an asymptomatic patient with a leiomyoma. On the chest film an abnormal opacity is seen behind the heart (arrow). The barium study demonstrates a lobulated mass (arrow) that does\\n not obstruct despite its large size. Esophageal leiomyoma Mucosal lesions are indicated by mucosal irregularities. Submucosal intramural lesions produce smooth filling defects, and\\n in profile, the margins often form close to a right angle with the esophageal wall. Extrinsic lesions tend to form longer obtuse angles if not fixed to the esophageal wall, and the\\nir epicenter may be outside the esophagus. In practice, the location of a lesion may be difficult to determine. On radiograph, tumor (arrows) protrudes into azygoesophageal recess. \\nOn esophagram, the inferior margin of this intramural lesion forms close to a right angle (arrow) with esophageal wall. Calcified esophageal leiomyoma A calcified esophageal mass is\\n almost always a leiomyoma. On the left a patient with a calcified esophageal lesion (arrows) protrudes into azygoesophageal recess on radiograph. Lesion (arrow) on CT and surgical \\nspecimen radiograph showing calcification. On the left a patient with granular cell myoblastomas, an uncommon benign tumor. These two lesions (arrows) are nonspecific in appearance,\\n but the proximal lesion does demonstrate overhanging and right angle margins indicating mural location. Pedunculated fibrovascular polyps\\nFibrovascular polyp:\\nPedunculated fibrovascular polyps are rare lesions, that are difficult to diagnose on esophagrams. Their movement during the examination produces an inconstant position. Their shape\\n may be suggestive as in this patient. The stalk is often difficult to identify.\\nDuplication:\\nOn the left a patient with an esophageal duplication. The findings on the barium study are non-specific. Lesion (arrows) is visible behind the heart on radiograph. Esophageal narrow\\ning (arrows) is caused by duplication. A foregut duplication cyst is a congenital cyst. In the case on the left it displaces hypopharynx and opacified esophagus (arrow) posteriorly \\nand trachea and larynx (asterisk) anteriorly.\\nMalignant neoplasms:\\nHere a list of malignant esophageal masses. Early and small esophageal carcinoma are not synonymous. Early esophageal carcinoma is limited to the mucosa, submucosa with no lymph nod\\ne metastases. Most are small ( Small esophageal carcinoma is defined by the size of the lesion, a diameter So an early carcinoma may be small, but a small carcinoma may be invasive \\nor metastatic and thus not an early carcinoma. This image is of a patient with an early esophageal carcinoma. Lesion is not visible on single contrast esophagram. Air-contrast esoph\\nagram shows surface irregularity (arrows) indicating a mucosal lesion. This was both a small lesion and a pathologically early squamous carcinoma. LEFT: Small polypoid carcinoma. RI\\nGHT: Large polypoid lesion. Advanced carcinoma has many gross appearances: On the left two cases of polypoid carcinoma. Esophageal carcinoma with ulcerations (arrows) and sharp righ\\nt angle junction with esophageal wall (arrowheads) This image is of a patient with an infiltrative ulcerated carcinoma. This lesion has an abrupt transition forming an acute angle a\\nnd overhanging edge. This indicates mural involvement and is different than obtuse angles usually produced by extrinsic lesions that are not fixed to the esophagus. Varicoid carcino\\nma These images are of a patient with a varicoid carcinoma. Unchanging appearance of filling defects indicate tumor rather than varices. Note sharp upper margin of lesion and ulcera\\ntion (arrows) LEFT: Varicoid carcinoma. RIGHT: Superficial spreading carcinoma. To the far left an image of a patient with a varicoid carcinoma. Long lobulations simulate varices bu\\nt did not vary during fluoroscopy. Note large irregular folds and soft tissue mass (arrow) of gastric fundus Next to it an image of a patient with a superficial spreading carcinoma.\\n Extensive superficial spread involves distal esophagus. This appearance can be seen with both early and advanced lesions. LEFT: Long irregular distal stricture due to carcinomaRIGH\\nT: Distal narrowing is not tapered and more proximal than achalasia. Irregularity (arrow) at narrowed site is subtle but persistent On the far left a patient with a carcinoma with s\\ntricture. An irregular, asymmetric stricture is highly suggestive of carcinoma. Smoothly tapered, symmetric strictures are characteristic of a benign etiology, but malignant strictu\\nres can have similar characteristics and mimic benign lesions. Next to it a patient with a carcinoma with stricture resembling achalasia. Distal esophageal malignancy may closely re\\nsemble achalasia. If esophageal motility is normal, achalasia can be excluded. If abnormal, however, subtle imaging features; asymmetric, irregular, abrupt, or high narrowing, mucos\\nal abnormality, or fixed abnormality suggest diagnosis. On the left another case of pseudoachalasia. Distal narrowing simulates achalasia, but narrowing is eccentric, shoulders are \\nasymmetric (arrows), and the mucosa is irregular at the tip of narrowing. CT shows gastric fundus thickening (arrows) due to adenocarcinoma. Tracheoesophageal stripe Width of the ju\\nxtaposed posterior tracheal and anterior esophageal walls > 5 mm on a lateral chest radiograph is suspicious for pathology, most often esophageal carcinoma or achalasia.

The incidence of cancer in Barrett's however is controversial. Who, how, and when individuals s\\nhould be screened is unresolved. Adenocarcinoma was 10% of esophageal malignancies in 1960s. Since 1960s, incidence increasing in USA greater than any other carcinoma. Incidence now\\n approaching or exceeding squamous carcinoma in Caucasian men in the USA and Europe. On the left a patient with an ulcerated (arrow) plaque like adenocarcinoma in a Barrett's esopha\\ngus. Primary gastric fundus adenocarcinoma can invade the esophagus, but means of differentiating invasion from a primary esophageal tumor are a subject of debate. On the left a pat\\nient with a gastric fundus adenocarcinoma. The barium study demonstrates marked irregular thickening of distal esophagus and folds at gastroesophageal junction. CT shows thickened i\\nrregular lesser curvature wall (arrows) near gastroesophageal junction. Spindle cell carcinoma Spindle cell carcinomas are rare neoplasms, also called carcinosarcomas. They are ofte\\nn bulky but nonobstructive as in the case on the left. Leiomyosarcomas and rare primary melanomas of the esophagus also tend to be bulky but do not cause significant obstruction.

ImagesT2W\\nimage shows a focal region of hyperintensity in the left peripheral zone of the\\nprostate. \\nThis area corresponds to a hypointense area in DCE images (images\\nprior to  enhancement). \\nRestricted\\ndiffusion is present. \\nThis corresponds to a proteinaceous cyst.\\nProstate volume and PSA density:\\nProstate volume determines the feasibility of external radiation therapy, which can be performed up to a volume of 55cc. Please note that this limit is only valid for conventional e\\nxtern radiation. For proton radiation this limit don't exist. PSA density-values of ≥ 0,20 contribute towards the suspicion of a clinically significant prostate malignancy. In this \\ncase the measurements of the prostate are 36 x 50 x 60mm (AP x LR x CC). This results in a volume of 0,52 x (3,6 x 5,0 x 6,0) = 56,2 cc. The PSA level in this patient was 5. The PSA\\n density is 5 : 56,2 = 0,09. This is a low PSA density and this patient probably has no clinically significant malignancy. Ellipsoid formulation:\\nMaximum AP and longitudinal diameters on a mid-sagittal T2W image and maximum transverse diameter on an axial T2W image multiplied by 0.52.\\nMR-protocol:\\nIn PI-RADS v2.1 the recommended sequences and settings are:\\nSpasmolytic agents:\\nSpasmolytic agents can be considered prior to examination to reduce movements of the small and large bowel. Air and feces within the rectum can impair diffusion assessment. The imag\\nes are of a patient who did not receive any preparation prior to the MR-exam. The presence of air and stool in the rectum induces discrete linear artifactual distortion in the regio\\nn of the prostate, restricting the diagnostic accuracy of both the DWI and ADC series. Here an example of a patient who did receive a minimal preparation enema administered a few ho\\nurs prior to the exam. This resulted in an evacuated rectum. Although an enema may induce rectal peristalsis, no artifacts were observed in this patient.\\nT1W:\\nT1W-images determine the presence of post-biopsy hemorrhage.\\nThis patient had systematic TRUS-guided biopsies 3 weeks earlier ImagesHigh signal\\nintensity on T1W image in the right peripheral zone, with little signal\\nreduction on T2W images, and no restricted diffusion on DWI / ADC (yellow\\narrow).\\nFurthermore, a suspicious lesion was\\nidentified right anteriorly in the transition zone with low signal intensity on\\nT2W and ADC and high signal intensity on DWI (black arrow). This lesion showed a Gleason score\\n4+3 following MRI-targeted biopsy.

MRI is a powerful tool: it\\n is able to detect cancer not visible on conventional imaging, it can be used as a problem-solving instrument, and it can be applied to screen high-risk patients. Breast MRI is also\\n better at monitoring the response to chemotherapy than other imaging modalities used today. It can change the treatment plan in 15-30% of patients with breast cancer. We will discu\\nss the interpretation of breast MRI by looking at: Specific breast lesions Introduction\\nIntroduction:\\nEnhancing lesions are divided into three main categories: focus/foci, masses, and areas of non-mass enhancement (1). Just as in mammography and ultrasound, we look at its shape, its\\n margins and its internal characteristics: this includes its T1- and T2-characteristics as well its enhancement pattern.\\n* Non-masslike enhancement\\n are areas of enhancement without a detectable three-dimensional mass. Features of non-mass enhancement include its distribution, its internal enhancement pattern, and whether the e\\nnhancement is symmetric or asymmetric.\\nFocus and foci:\\nOne of the things we run into are 'little bright objects'. These foci are enhancing areas of less than 5mm in diameter and are too small to characterize. They have persistent type 1\\n curves. These lesions are typically stable on follow-up and are considered to be a part of the normal\\nbackground enhancement pattern in the breast.\\nMasses:\\nEnhancing mass with an irregular shape, which proved to be an angiosarcoma\\nMorphology:\\nShape A mass can be round, oval, lobulated, or irregular. Lobulated masses have undulating contours. Irregular masses have an uneven shape that cannot be characterized as round, ova\\nl, or lobulated. If a mass is irregularly shaped, it has a 32% chance of being malignant. The image on the left shows a large, irregular mass, which proved to be an angiosarcoma. Th\\ne image on the far left is a juvenile fibroadenoma - it is oval in shape and has smooth margins, i.e. typically benign. The non-enhancing septations are not seen in this case. The i\\nmage on the right is another example of a fibroadenoma: a lobulated mass with non-enhancing septations. Epidermal inclusion cyst with smooth margins Margin Margins can be described \\nas smooth, irregular, or spiculated . Spiculated margins are frequently a feature of malignant breast lesions and radial\\nscars. If a mass has spiculated margins, it has an 80% chance of being malignant. On the left is an image showing a large, round mass with smooth margins, which turned out to be an \\nepidermal inclusion cyst. Invasive ductal carcinoma with spiculated margins The image on the far left shows a spiculated mass, i.e. 80% chance of being malignant. . Next to it the c\\norresponding gross pathologic specimen. You can see the spiculations invading the surrounding tissue in both. Just like on mammography, this lesion is has a high likelihood of malig\\nnancy and would be labelled BIRADS 5. The image on the far left shows an irregularly shaped mass with irregular margins, which was an invasive ductal carcinoma. The image on the rig\\nht shows a similarly irregularly shaped and irregularly marginated lesion, this time an adenoid cystic carcinoma. LEFT: Fibroadenoma with non-enhancing septations. RIGHT: Invasive c\\narcinoma with enhancing septations The image on the left is a classic benign fibroadenoma. It is a lobulated mass with non-enhancing septations. On this image the margins are a bit \\nirregular here and there, which may be a reason to biopsy this lesion anyway. The image on the right is a classic carcinoma. It is an irregularly shaped mass with irregular margins \\nand enhancing internal septations (the enhancement is not well seen on this image). Fat-containing hamartoma with central high signal on T1WI (arrow)\\nT1-T2 characteristics:\\nHigh signal on T1 The pre-contrast T1, non fat-suppressed sequence can show the presence of fat in a lesion. Central high signal on a T1-weighted image can be seen in intramammary l\\nymph nodes or fat necrosis. Fat is also seen in hamartomas. The image on the left shows an example of a fat-containing hamartoma in the breast. Breast lesions containing fat are ben\\nign unless they are rapidly growing. Rapidly growing lesions should be biopsied. High signal on T2-fatsat In T2 fat-suppressed images we are looking for water. Lesions that are brig\\nht on T2 include cysts, lymph nodes and fat necrosis. These are all benign lesions. Unfortunately there is one malignant lesion that has a high signal intensity on T2 fat-suppressed\\n weighted images. This is the colloid carcinoma. It is the exception to the rule that all things with bright signal on T2 fat-suppressed images are benign. On the image on the left \\nthere are multiple rounded areas in both breasts. These are multiple cysts. Fibroadenoma (left) and a colloid carcinoma (right). Both are bright on T2WI. The image on the far left s\\nhows a round lesion with bright signal on T2. This is a a fibroadenoma. On the right is an example of a colloid carcinoma in a breast with dense, glandular tissue. It is the excepti\\non to the rule that all things with bright signal on T2 fat-suppressed images are benign. Moderate and low signal on T2-fatsat The T2 fat-suppressed sequences are for detecting lesi\\nons with high signal, not moderate or low signal. Moderate and low signal intensities can be caused by cancer.\\nEnhancement pattern of a mass:\\nMass enhancement occurs in six main patterns: Homogeneous enhancement The image on the left shows a homogeneously enhancing lesion. This proved to be an invasive ductal carcinoma. I\\nnvasive lobular carcinoma with heterogenous enhancement Heterogenous enhancement On the left, the image shows an irregularly shaped mass with spiculations and a heterogeneous intern\\nal enhancement pattern, which proved to be an invasive lobular carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma with rim enhancement Rim enhancement The image on the left shows rim enhancement \\nof a lesion invading the surrounding tissue in a case of invasive ductal carcinoma. Type 1 curve with slow rise and a continued rise with tim\\nTemporal Resolution - Kinetic Analysis (Curves):\\nFirst we look at the initial upslope of the curve during the first one to two minutes. This is either slow, medium or rapid. Then there is the delayed portion - two minutes or more \\nafter the injection of contrast. This part of the curve shows either an increase, plateau or washout. The kinetic analysis takes about six minutes of repetitive scanning in total an\\nd can lead to three types of curve. Type 1 On the image on the left is a type 1 curve. There is a slow rise and a continued rise with time. A lesion with a type 1 curve has a chance\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 71}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\" of 6% of being malignant. Type 3 curve with rapid initial rise, followed by washout in the delayed phase Type 3 The type 3 curve shows a rapid initial rise, followed by a drop-off \\nwith time (washout) in the delayed phase. A lesion with this type of curve is malignant in 29-77%. This is the red on the CAD (Computer Aided Detection). Type 2 Then there is the ty\\npe 2 curve, which is in the middle: a slow or rapid initial rise\\nfollowed by a plateau in the delayed phase, which is allowed a variance of 10% up or down. The chance of a lesion with a type 2 curve being malignant lies somewhere between\\nthe 6% of the type 1 curve and the 29-77% of the type 3 curve. Many physicians will biopsy lesions with type 2 curves. For non-mass enhancement, kinetics are not very useful. If the\\nre is clumped enhancement in a breast it must be biopsied, even though there are no areas with a type 3 curve. CAD with a large area of type 3 enhancement\\nCAD:\\nComputer Aided Detection is a purely kinetic evaluation. It does not evaluate the anatomy or pathology of the images. CAD looks at the curves and peak enhancements for the contrast \\n(automated kinetics). It also has some very nice features, including motion registration during subtraction, which can correct for a patient's movement during the exam - something n\\not all MRI scanners can do. It can do multiplanar reconstruction and subtraction very well and very quickly – it also has a good measurement package. The CAD shows a large area of r\\ned superimposed on the breast lesion in the image on the left. In CAD, red is bad: it means type 3 washout, and probably cancer. The images on the left show a large, abnormally enha\\nncing area in the left breast. The CAD has detected some very small areas with type 3 washout (in red). When you look at CAD images, take note of the worst (red) areas. This was a l\\narge invasive ductal carcinoma.\\nNon-mass enhancement:\\nDistribution:\\nNon-mass enhancement is enhancement without three-dimensional characteristics. It is important because it occurs in a significant number of cancers. You need to look at its distribu\\ntion, its enhancement pattern and its symmetry or asymmetry. The table on the left summarizes the terms used to describe the distribution of non-mass enhancement in the breast. Foca\\nl refers to non-mass enhancement in less than 25% of a quadrant of the breast. Ductal involvement is enhancement in a ductal distribution, and is cancer in 60% of cases. Linear enha\\nncement is similar to ductal enhancement, but does not have a ductal orientation. This finding means cancer in 31% of cases. Segmental enhancement refers to multiple ducts and has a\\n 78% chance of being cancer. Regional enhancement is not ductal or segmental but larger than focal and is cancer in 21%. Diffuse non-mass enhancement is typically benign. Focal DCIS\\n The image on the left shows focal non-mass enhancement. This proved to be a focal DCIS. The image on the left shows linear non-mass enhancement. This proved to be stromal fibrosis.\\n The image on the left shows a mass as well as areas of linear non-mass enhancement. This proved to be linear DCIS with an invasive ductal carcinoma. LEFT: segmental DCIS RIGHT: reg\\nional DCIS On the left examples of segmental and regional non-mass enhancement in DCIS. The image on the far left shows a mass with associated ductal enhancement coming from the mas\\ns,\\nwhich corresponds to anterior and posterior expansion of the tumor in this case of DCIS. The image next to it shows an example of linear non-mass enhancement in a different orientat\\nion to that of the ducts in stromal fibrosis. LEFT: Heterogeneous enhancement in invasive ductal carcinomaRIGHT: Punctate enhancement in a hamartoma with fibrocystic change (arrows)\\nInternal Enhancement Pattern - Nonmass:\\nNon-mass enhancement can be termed homogeneous and heterogeneous, just as mass enhancement can. As mentioned earlier, punctate enhancement is usually benign, but it can occur focall\\ny. In that case there is a 25% chance of cancer. Clumped enhancement is the most important non-mass enhancing pattern to recognize. It has a 60% chance of cancer (typically DCIS). F\\nor non-mass enhancement, kinetics are not very useful. If there is clumped enhancement in a breast it must be biopsied, even if there are no areas with a type 3 curve. On the far le\\nft heterogeneous enhancement in an invasive ductal carcinoma. The image next to it shows punctate enhancement in a hamartoma with fibrocystic change (arrows). Clumped enhancement in\\n DCIS Clumped enhancement Clumped enhancement is the most important non-mass enhancing pattern to recognize. It has a 60% chance of cancer (typically DCIS). On the left two examples\\n of clumped enhancement in DCIS.\\nAssociated findings:\\nCarcinoma with extensive thickening of the skin Associated findings can be: The image on the left shows a relatively small carcinoma in the right breast, with extensive thickening o\\nf the skin. Inflammatory carcinoma with thickening of the skin The image on the left shows a large inflammatory carcinoma with diffuse thickening of the skin. Enhancing large lymph \\nnode (arrow) in a patient with breast cancer The image on the left shows a large enhancing lymph node on the right.\\nSpecific breast tumors:\\nCysts:\\nCysts have a high signal on T2 fat-suppressed images. After the injection of gadolinium, they will show up as filling defects, sometimes with rim enhancement. Classic fibroadenoma\\nFibroadenoma:\\nFibroadenomas are the most common benign breast lesions after cysts.\\nIn order to be certain a lesion is a fibroadenoma, certain criteria must be met: A fibroadenoma must have benign spatial characteristics. This means it can not have a spiculated or \\nmicrolobulated border. On the left an example of a classic fibroadenoma: a round, smoothly marginated lesion\\nwith some black or gray areas on the inside, which are the non-enhancing septations. This lesion has a type 1 curve. Fibroadenoma with nonenhancing septations On the far left is ano\\nther example of a fibroadenoma with clear non-enhancing septations.\\nThese septations are also visible on the gross pathology. Two examples of a hamartoma with dark areas of fat on a fat suppressed T1WI with Gd.\\nFat containing lesions:\\nThe pre-contrast T1, non fat-suppressed sequence can show the presence of fat in a lesion. High signal on a T1-weighted image can be seen in intramammary lymph nodes, fat necrosis a\\nnd hamartomas. These areas will be dark on fat suppressed images. On the left two classic examples of hamartomas. These lesions have fat-containing areas which are suppressed on the\\nse images after the administration of intravenous gadolinium.\\nDCIS:\\nKinetics are usually not useful in DCIS, especially not in cases when low-grade. Many cases of DCIS show no washout and usually there is slow initial enhancement. The distribution o\\nf the enhancement however is important. DCIS typically shows clumped, ductal, linear or segmental non-mass enhancement. On the left a patient with areas of non-mass enhancement in b\\noth breasts (DCIS). There is a small enhancing mass medially in the left breast, which was a small invasive carcinoma. DCIS and IDC The image on the left shows an enhancing mass in \\nthe left breast. This proved to be an invasive carcinoma. Lateral to it is an area of ductal non-mass enhancement, which proved to be DCIS. DCIS bilaterally On the left another case\\n with diffuse, bilateral DCIS. DCIS bilaterally Another case of DCIS, located laterally in both breasts. The cases on the left are more difficult to diagnose .

With fibrous or cartilaginous coalition, the bones are in close proximity, bo\\nth have irregular surfaces, and the anteromedial calcaneus is abnormally widened or flattened. \\nOn lateral radiographs, elongation of the anterior dorsal calcaneus may simulate an anteater’s nose. \\nHypoplasia of the talus is sometimes observed in calcaneonavicular coalition. On the CT we see a coalition between the calcaneus and the os naviculare. The CT shows sclerosis and su\\nbchondral cysts as a sign of ‘friction’ due to the neoarticulation. The MRI shows bone marrow edema as a sign of a symptomatic coalition. Go back to the cases...\\ncase 3 - distortion:\\nThis is another case of a fracture of the posterior malleolus. Again we have to look at the algoritm for ankle fractures... A fracture of the posterior malleolus is seen in a Weber \\nB or a Weber C fracture. In this case we have already seen an oblique fracture of the lateral malleolus, which means that we are dealing with a Weber b fracture.\\nNow we only need to determine which stage it is.\\nThe most common stage 2 is stable, but stage 3 and 4 are unstable. In this case we already in stage 3 and we wanna look for signs of stage 4.\\nA painful soft tissue swelling at examination would already indicate stage 4, but in this case there is more. Maybe you want to go back to the radiograph before you continue reading\\n... In this case we are looking for a stage 4. Now you notice the soft tissue swelling on the medial side (arrow).\\nThe most important finding however is the irregularity and radiolucency of the upper part of the medial malleolus.\\nIf you use your imagination, you can identify a fracure line here, which you would not have seen if you did not use the algoritm. Go back to the cases...\\ncase 4 - distortion:\\nThe only thing that we notice is soft tissue swelling especially on the medial side. Continue with the ankle injury algoritm... Injury to the medial collateral bands can be seen in \\nWeber B fracture stage 4.\\nHowever there are no signs of a WeberB fracture. The other possibility is that there is a Weber C fracture with a high fibula fracture, that is not visible on the x-rays of the ankl\\ne.\\nThe medial band rupture is stage 1 and the injury may stop there or continue to stage 2,3 or even 4.\\nWe need additional x-rays of the entire lower leg to find out which stage we are dealing with. Continue with the x-rays of the lower leg... A high fibula fracture is seen (Maisonneu\\nve).\\nUsually the patient will only feel pain at the level of the ankle since ligament ruptures are very painful and not notice the fibula fracture. Go back to the cases...\\ncase 5 - chronic pain:\\nThe findings are: The subtalar joint consists of the anterior, middle, and posterior facets. Talocalcaneal fusion most commonly involves the middle facet at the level of the sustent\\naculum tali. Talocalcaneal coalitions may be difficult to visualize on the standard radiographic views of the foot because of the complex orientation of the subtalar joint. A number\\n of secondary radiographic signs of talocalcaneal coalition have been described, including: A talar beak occurs because of impaired subtalar joint motion, which results in the navic\\nular overriding the talus. Periosteal elevation occurs at the insertion of the talonavicular ligament, and, ultimately, a cycle of osseous repair results in formation of the talar b\\neak. The “C sign,” is a C-shaped line on the lateral view, that outlines the medial talar dome and posteroinferior sustentaculum. The C sign results from bone bridging between the t\\nalar dome and sustentaculum, as well as the prominent inferior outline of the sustentaculum.\\nAs the x-ray beam strikes the posteroinferior outline of the abnormal sustentaculum tangentially over a long distance, an uninterrupted “C” results. The C sign may be observed in bo\\nth osseous and nonosseous coalitions. ImagesOn the T1W-image there is a bony coalition and ankylosis of the talus with the calcaneus. Go back to the cases...\\nAnkle:\\ncase 2 - distortion:\\nIn this case the most obvious finding is a fracture of the posterior malleolus.\\nThis should urge you to look for other findings, since an isolated fracture of the posterior malleolus is extremely uncommon and probably does not exists. You need to look at the al\\ngoritm for ankle fractures.. Algoritm for ankle fractures In the algoritm a fracture of the posterior malleolus is either: This means that we have to look for other signs.\\nSince there is no sign of a Weber B fracture, this must be a Weber C fracture. Are there any other signs that are in favor of a Weber C fracure? Yes there is.\\nNow we recognize the soft tissue swelling on the medial side and a small avulsion, which is stage 1 of this injury. We now can predict a high fibula fracture, which was confirmed by\\n a radiograph of the whole lower leg. Go back to the cases...\\ncase 5 - distortion:\\nThere is a subtle fracture visible on the Morrison's and the lateral view.\\nThis is a large tertius fracture. \\nThere is no sign of a Weber B type of fibula fracture. The combination of this fracture and the soft tissue swelling on the medial side indicate that we are dealing with a Weber C t\\nype of injury (or pronation exorotation injury according to Lauge-Hansen). The medial collateral band injury is stage 1 and the tertius fracture is stage 4.\\nThis means that this is an unstable fracture.\\nThere must be a high fibula fracture.

              " Document(page_content=\"What to do with incidentally found lesions in the liver?:\\nMaarten van Leeuwen, Joost Nederend and Robin Smithuis\\nRadiology department of the University Medical Centre of Utrecht, the Leiden University and the Rijnland hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2007-05-12 This review is based on a presentation given by Maarten van Leeuwen for the Dutch Radiology Society and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Joost N\\nederend and Robin Smithuis. With the increasing use of multidetector CT small hepatic lesions are frequently depicted. In many cases the pathological nature of these incidentally fo\\nund liver lesions or incidentalomas is not known. This results in a diagnostic problem, which is initiated by radiology so radiologists should take responsibility in correctly categ\\norizing these lesions as to their clinical significance. In this article we will discuss the management of two different type of incidentally found liver lesions: Hypervascular lesi\\nons. TSTC (too small to characterize lesions)\\nTSTC (too small to characterize lesions):\\nContrast enhanced CT (portal phase) showing multiple small hypodense lesions. First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. We see multiple hypodense lesions. We cannot\\n diagnose them with certainty as: For this type of lesions which, due to their small size and atypical imaging features, cannot be confidently categorized, the term TSTC (to small t\\no characterize) lesions has been coined.\\nTSTCs in patients without a known malignancy:\\nJones (1992) studied 1500 patients who had an abdominal CT examination (1). He found:\\nTSTCs in patients with a primary malignancy:\\nSchwartz (1999) studied 2978 patient with a known malignancy (2). He found TSTCs in 12% of patients with a known malignancy. In 88% of patients the lesions were benign and in 12% th\\ney proved to be metastases (1.4% of all patients). The percentage of malignancy depended much on the known primary tumor. Most metastases were found in patients with breast cancer. \\nThis is in accordance with the observation that breast metastases usually present as multiple small lesions, while liver metastases of colorectal cancer and lymphoma usually present\\n as a solitary or a few larger masses. Probability of a lesion being benign using size and edge as characterization Robinson (2003) studied various characteristics of TSTCs and thei\\nr correlation with malignancy (3). The lesions where classified by their behavior on follow up CT, as either stable or unstable. Image features of stable (benign) lesions where smal\\nl size and sharp edge. Heterogeneity and soft tissue attenuation were associated with unstable behavior, but only seen in a small minority of cases.\\nTSTCs in breastcarcinoma:\\nKrakora (2004) studied the prognostic importance of small hypoattenuating hepatic lesions seen at initial CT in patients with breast cancer, who did not have definite hepatic metast\\nases at initial examination (4). One or more small hypoattenuating hepatic lesions (TSTCs ) were seen in 54 of 153 patients (35%). During a median follow-up of 584 days definite hep\\natic metastases developed in 43 of 153 patients (28%). No difference was found in the chance for development of liver metastases in patients with or without TSTCs at initial CT. Kra\\nkora concluded that in patients with breast cancer, who do not have definite hepatic metastases at presentation, there is no evidence that small hypoattenuating hepatic lesions seen\\n at initial CT contribute to an increased risk of subsequently developing hepatic metastases.\\nConclusion:\\nIn a patient without a known malignancy these small hypodense lesions, as a rule, should be considered as benign. In a patient with a known malignancy a single TSTC lesion can also \\nbe assumed to be benign. Even multiple TSTCs in these patients are mostly benign, especially when they are small, sharply defined and hypodens. In these latter cases you should not \\nbe too defensive! Don't dictate 'we can't rule out metastases'. In patients with breastcancer and no known livermetastases at presentation, these TSTC lesions have no positive predi\\nctive value for the development of livermetastases in the long term.\\nIncidental hypervascular lesions:\\nIncidental hypervascular lesions are also very common findings in liver imaging. It is important to differentiate between 'touch' and 'don't touch' lesions. Benign 'don't touch' hyp\\nervascular tumors include hemangioma, FNH and small adenomas. 'Touch' lesions include large adenomas (more then 5 cm) and malignant tumors like Hepatocelular carcinoma (HCC), Fibrol\\namellar carcinoma (FLHCC) and metastases. These enhancing, solid lesions should be differentiated from vascular lesions\\n, like hepatic aneurysm,\\naortaportal shunt or pseudoaneurysm.\\nIncidence of hypervascular lesions:\\nKarhunen (1986) found at autopsy an incidence of 20 % hemangioma, 3% FNH and 1% adenoma (5). A study in 1989 by the AFIP showed a FNH : adenoma ratio of 8:1 in a series of 9000 auto\\npsies (6). Typical hemangioma with nodular peripheral enhancement. Enhancement in Hemangioma A hemangioma is a slowly perfused vascular space. So the timing and amount of enhancemen\\nt will\\nfollow, but lag behind the arterial system. Hemangiomas less than 1 cm frequently demonstrate\\nimmediate homogenous enhancement, isodense to the aorta. Hemangiomas larger than 1cm generally show slow\\ncentripetal spread of nodular enhancement, slowly decreasing in density. On the left a typical hemangioma. Enhancement in arterial phase is almost isodense to the aorta, and, as con\\ntrast diffuses toward the center of the lesion, the level of enhancement lowers slowly, and in the late phase is still hyperdense compared to the vascular spaces. 'Capillary blush' \\nin FNH. Notice early enhancement, but not as bright as in hemangioma. In venous and delayed phase the enhancement is almost isodense to the liver. Enhancement in 'capillary blush' T\\nhe typical, slowly perfused vascular space enhancement of a hemangioma has\\nto be differentiated from the 'capillary blush' due to an abundant capillary network\\nwhich characterizes FNH, adenoma, HCC and\\nhypervascular metastases. As capillaries are surrounded by tissue the overall enhancement will be less\\ndense compared to the\\nenhancement of the vascular spaces in\\nhemangioma. Hence, in capillary blush, the enhancement occurs slightly later compared to the aorta and is less dense than the aorta. Typical hemangioma on dynamic MR\\nHemangioma:\\nHemangiomas on dynamic MR will show the same\\nenhancement characteristics as on contrast-enhanced CT. The advantage of MR over CT is its higher sensitivity to contrast as will be shown in the next case. Aspecific hypovascular l\\nesion on CT On the left an atypical, apparently hypovascular lesion on CT, possibly metastasis. MR depicts enhancement better than CT Same case on dynamic MR.

In the portal venous phase and in the equilibrium phase it has the same enhancement as the aorta. So all app\\nearances are consistent with a hemangioma, a benign, non-solid\\nvascular lesion. Once we have excluded hemangiomas, our\\nmain goal is to determine whether a hypervascular lesion is a\\nFNH, which is the most prevalent hypervascular\\nsolid lesion, or whether it is a lesion\\nwhich needs further management like adenoma,\\nHCC, FLHCC or hypervascular metastases. For this purpose we have to look for morphologic features\\nlike inhomogeneity and presence of capsule, scar,\\ncalcification or fat. Two FNHs with late enhancing central scar\\nFocal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH):\\nOn the left two adjacent hypervascular lesions with\\nhomogeneous enhancement in arterial phase and hypodense\\ncentral scars in arterial and venous phase, which\\nenhance in the equilibrium phase. This is characteristic of FNH. Notice that the small FNH, which is\\nanterior and right to the bigger one, has the same enhancement pattern. FNH is considered a non-neoplastic, hyperplastic\\nresponse to a congenital vascular malformation. Histologically, FNH is not a tumor and\\nconsists of benign-appearing hepatocytes\\noccurring in a liver that is otherwise normal (i.e. no\\ncirrhosis). At late arterial phase, FNH typically presents\\nwith a bright homogeneous enhancement, but less intense than the aorta with\\na hypodense central scar. Smaller (\\nThe radiating hypodense fibrous bands or\\nsepta, arising from the scar, are not infrequent and\\nquite characteristic. At portal phase, FNH is often iso-attenuating\\nto the normal liver and may be difficult to\\ndeliniate.

Typical FNH on MR Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (2) On the left a typical FNH on MR. Slightly hypointense on T1WI and slightly\\nhyperintense on T2WI. The scar is somewhat hyperintense\\non T2. The enhancement is as we\\nexpect with 'capillary blush' with a scar that\\nenhances late in the equilibrium phase. Atypical FNH with non-enhancing central scar Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (3) On the left a lesion, that has all the\\ncharacteristics of FNH except for lack of late\\nenhancement of the central scar. In addition, it is slightly hypodense to normal parenchyma in\\nthe portal and equilibrium phase. However, all other characteristics are present\\nlike lobular enhancement, central scar and no\\ncapsule, and therefore we characterize this lesion as FNH. Hemangioma and FNH on ultrasound and dynamic MR. Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (4) The ultrasound image on the left shows two \\nlesions. The small one (blue arrow) is characteristic of a\\nhemangioma, while the larger one (green arrow) is non\\nspecific on US. On T2WI the hemangioma shows the typical\\nhomogeneous hyperintensity . The larger lesion is somewhat hypointense on T1 and somewhat hyperintense on T2. The enhancement is almost homogeneous with\\nsmall septae that do not enhance in the arterial\\nphase and do show late enhancement (yellow arrows). On T2WI the hemangioma shows the typical\\nhomogeneous hyperintensity . The larger lesion is somewhat hypointense on T1 and somewhat hyperintense on T2. The enhancement is almost homogeneous with\\nsmall septae that do not enhance in the arterial\\nphase, and do show late enhancement (yellow arrows). We also characterize this lesion as FNH. Small FNH Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (5) On the left another FNH on MR. The lesion is al\\nmost isointense to liver on T1WI and T2WI, but shows more contrast to the liver on a T1W-MPRGRE (gradient-echo). The enhancement in the arterial phase is lobulated with nonenhancing\\n septation and in the equilibrium phase the lesion is not different from normal liver parenchyma. Notice that the lesion has a small scar. Small FNHs often do not have a central sca\\nr on imaging and even not on pathologic examination. Incidental hypervascular lesion on a CTA for pulmonary emboli Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (6) Another FNH on the left, in order to\\n get really familiar with these common lesions. On a CTA for pulmonary emboli a small hypervascular lesion is seen in the liver. Further evaluation was done with MR. On T1WI the les\\nion is not seen and on T2WI it is only slightly hyperintense. In the arterial phase there is homogeneous enhancement and in the venous phase the lesion is not seen. Provided that th\\nis patient does not have liver cirrhosis, this is probably a benign lesion, probably FNH. As the appearance was not pathognomonic for FNH, a follow up examination was done and the l\\nesion had not changed, making the\\ndiagnosis FNH most likely. When does it stop, this comfortable feeling, that something is a FNH? It stops when there are too many features that do not belong to a FNH. Like the case\\n on the left. Decide for yourself which findings are compatible with the diagnosis typical FNH and which are not. The lesion on the left does have a central scar\\nlike FNH , but on the T1WI the lesion is inhomogeneous and not sharply defined. On T2WI the scar has a low signal intensity.

This particula\\nr form of HCC may mimick FNH on imaging. In contrast to HCC, the prognosis is reasonable. Like FNH, FLHCC also is a hypervascular, lobulated mass with a central scar\\n. Both FNH and FLHCC appear in normal liver, unlike\\nHCC that is most frequently seen in a cirrhotic liver. In distinction to FNH, FLHCC is inhomogeneous,\\nlarge (> 5 cm), frequently has calcifications (>70%), a\\nblunt central scar and usually there is\\nlymphadenopathy. Calcifications in FNH are so uncommon that it\\nshould make you consider another diagnosis like\\nFLHCC. Pathologic specimen of FLHCC and FNH (Courtesy Dr. Baron) Fibrolamellar HCC (2) On the left a pathologic specimen of FLHCC and FNH. At first glance they look very similar. Ho\\nwever when you look carefully you will notice the more lamellar and heterogeneous structure of FLHCC compared to the homogeneous appearance of FNH. Left-lobe fibrolamellar HCC.

In a series of 31 cases of FLHCC, Ichikawa et al (7) found the following: Adenomas in arterial, portal venous and equilibrium ph\\nase\\nAdenoma:\\nAn adenoma is regularly characterized by bleeding, fat or peliosis. Although we cannot see peliosis itself, it can result in a hyperintense lesion on T1WI. On the left two incidenta\\nlomas. Decide for yourself why these are not FNH lesions. In the arterial phase there are two\\nhypervascular lesions, somewhat less\\ndense than we would expect in FNH. Both lesions demonstrate a halo of a capsule,\\nwhich should not be apparent in FNH. Unlike in FNH, the enhancement is\\ninhomogeneous and in the portovenous and\\nequilibrium phase the lesions are not isodens to\\nthe liver. Adenoma with hemorrhage Adenoma (2) Regularly adenomas present with bleeding. On the left images of a woman who presented with acute abdominal pain. On US a livermass was\\n seen and free fluid surrounding the liver. This is a typical presentation of an adenoma. On portal phase CT, the lesion is hypointense with haemorrhage adjacent to the lesion, exte\\nnding subcapsularly. Adenoma: non-specific features on CT Adenoma (3) On the left an US image of an incidentally found lesion in a 50 y old female. Work up was done with CT, but onl\\ny non-specific features were found without signs of hypervascularity. . Continue with next images. Adenoma: capillary blush in arterial phase and signal loss in out of phase image i\\nndicating the presence of fat. In contrast to the CT, there clearly is\\nenhancement in the arterial phase on MR, again demonstrating that MR\\ndepicts enhancement better than CT. The enhancement is due to a capillary blush, most intense in the arterial phase with apparent wash-out in portal and equilibrium phase, due to gr\\neater enhancement of the surrounding parenchyma. In the 'out of phase' image there is signal loss\\nindicating that the lesion contains fat,\\nwhich is very suggestive for adenoma. A HCC may also contain fat, but in this case\\nthere is no cirrhosis and the entire\\nlesion shows signal loss,\\nwhich we would not expect in HCC. HCC: hypervascular lesion in a cirrhotic liver\\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):\\nConcerning the diagnosis of HCC, there is\\none thing to remember: 'Every hypervascular lesion in a cirrhotic liver is\\nHCC until proven otherwise'\\n'. On the left we see a cirrhotic liver with irregular\\nmargins (arrows), suggesting that the hypervascular lesion is a HCC.

David Yousem is currently the Dire\\nctor of Neuroradiology and Professor of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is also the editor of the book 'Neuroradiology: the Requisites'. In this article a systematic app\\nroach to orbital pathology is presented based on division of the orbit into the following compartments: Extraconal space Anatomic Considerations\\nAnatomic Considerations:\\nThe first thing you do when you see a lesion in the orbit, is to decide whether it is an ocular lesion or a non-ocular lesion, i.e. is it involving the globe or involving the struct\\nures outside the globe. If it is a non-ocular lesion, the next question is whether the lesion is located within the intraconal space, i.e. within the space bounded by the cone forme\\nd by the extraocular muscles, or whether it is located within the conal or extraconal space? Once you have decided where the lesion is located, consider the differential diagnostic \\npossibilities using the mnemonic VITAMIN C and D. We will first describe the anatomic spaces of the orbit and summarize the pathology within these spaces, even if some of these path\\nologies are not visible radiologically. Then we will discuss the radiological findings in certain orbital diseases. Ocular space The eye has the following well defined anatomic spac\\nes: Anterior chamber When we move from anterior to posterior the first area is the anterior chamber. It is bounded by the cornea anteriorly and the lens and iris posteriorly. Specif\\nic pathologies within the anterior chamber are: Posterior chamber This is a very small area posterior to the iris, which we cannot discern on imaging. Specific pathologies in this a\\nrea are: glaucoma, uveitis and ciliary melanoma. Vitreous body The larger area posterior to the lens is the vitreous body. Specific pathologies within the vitreous body are: The vit\\nreous body is surrounded by the membranes of the retina, the choroid and the sclera. Retina pathology: Choroid pathology: Sclera pathology: The intraconal space is marked by arrows \\nand is located within the muscle cone It contains the optic nerve, vessels and cranial nerves III, IV and VI. Intraconal space The ocular muscles within the orbit form a muscle-cone\\n. These ocular muscles are connected via the annulus of Zin, which is a fibrous connective tissue sheet and together they form the conal space. It separates the intraconal from the \\nextraconal space. Intra-orbital pathology which is non-ocular is either in the intraconal, conal or extraconal space. Intraconal space pathology: Conal space The conal space is form\\ned by the ocular muscles and an envelope of fascia. Conal space pathology: Extraconal space The extraconal space is the area outside the muscle cone. Extraconal space pathology: Orb\\nital appendages The lacrimal gland is located superolaterally in the orbit. Diseases of the lacrimal gland can be divided into granulomatous, glandular and developmental (see Table)\\n. Secretions go medially across the globe and are collected in the punctum and then go into the lacrimal sac. From the lacrimal sac secretions travel inferiorly to the nasal lacrima\\nl duct, which drains under the inferior terminate into the nose. In children congenital obstructions of the valves in the lacrimal duct can lead to cystic areas medially in the orbi\\nt also known as dacryocystoceles. In adults obstruction is more often due to strictures from ethmoid sinusitis or stones blocking the nasolacrimal duct. This will result in epiphera\\n or increased tearing. Drainage can be improved with balloon dilatation.\\nOcular pathology:\\nRetinoblastoma: axial FLAIR (left) and coronal enhanced T1WI (right)\\nCalcifications:\\nIn adults the most common intraorbital calcifications occur at the tendinous insertion of the ocular muscles. Other common calcifications are at the optic nerve head within the eye,\\n also called 'optic disc drusen'. These are usually asymptomatic, but when the ophtomologist inspects the eye, there is the impression of papilledema, i.e. pseudo-papilledema.

On the left an image of an adolescent with bilateral retinoblastoma.\\nRetinoblastoma:\\nAs you can see in the table on the left, retinoblastoma is a one of the more common tumor in the first year of life. The other tumors in this age group are neuroblastoma, Wilm's tum\\nor, leukemia and teratoma. All bilateral cases are hereditary and result from a deficient tumor suppression gene on chromosome 13. The diseases that are listed in the differential d\\niagnosis are all uncommon. Bilateral retinoblastoma On the left images are of a 13 month old female with bilateral lesions as a result of bilateral retinoblastoma. Small retinoblast\\nomas are treated with different kinds of therapy (cryoablation, laser photocoagulation, chemothermotherapy, brachytherapy, plaque radiotherapy) in order to save the eye and avoid en\\nucleation. If the patent is treated with radiation, there is a 30% chance of a second malignancy within the radiation field, due to the radiation but also due to the deficient tumor\\n suppression gene. Outside the radiation field there is an 8% chance of malignancy. In order of frequency: Osteosarcoma > other sarcoma > melanoma > carcinoma. Retinoblastoma with c\\nalcification These patients are also at risk for pineal tumors and parasellar PNETs. The pineal gland is considered as the third eye and the third testicle. Meaning, you can develop\\n retinoblastoma in the pineal gland, i.e. trilateral retinoblastoma, but also germinoma. Always examine the brain in these patients and remember that at the age of 0-4 years, which \\nis the peak age for retinoblastoma, the pineal gland does not calcify, so any calcification in this region is suspicious of retinoblastoma. On the left images are of another patient\\n with retinoblastoma. This tumor presents as a large calcification. When a retinoblastoma occupies more than half of the globe, as in this case, the eye has to be enucleated. Leukoc\\noria Usually, when a light shines through the iris, the retina appears red to the observer. In leukocoria (white pupil) the retina abnormally appears white. Retinablastoma is usuall\\ny detected through leukocoria as it occurs in two third of patients with retinoblastoma. These children are usually too young to present with visual complaints. There are many cause\\ns of leukocoria as listed in the table on the left. Melanoma\\nMelanoma:\\nOn the left images of an adult with an ocular mass. The most common intraocular lesion in an adult is melanoma (as in this case).\\nNumber two is metastases and others like hemangioma, leiomyoma and osteoma are uncommon. Persistent hyperplastic primary vitrous\\nPersistent hyperplastic primary vitrous (PHPV):\\nOn the left another cause of leukocoria. This is persistent hyperplastic primary vitrous (PHPV). There is a persistent hyaloid canal when the hyaloid artery does not integrate. On t\\nhe images we see a persistent canal that goes from the optic nerve to the lens. There is also retinal detachment (occurs in 30-55%) and notice the microphtalmia. PHPV is the second \\nmost common cause of leukocoria. These patients also develop glaucoma and cataract.\\nCoats' disease:\\nCoats' disease is a rare eye disorder of unknown cause, leading to full or partial blindness, characterized by abnormal development of blood vessels behind the retina. Traumatic cat\\naract\\nGlobe rupture:\\nOn the left images of a patient who presented in the ER with post-traumatic orbital swelling. This patient has globe rupture and specifically rupture of the anterior chamber. As rad\\niologists we are used to looking at the vitreous body if we think of globe rupture, but that is not enough. Notice that the depth of the anterior chamber is decreased. There is incr\\neased density anteriorly as a result of hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber). Also notice that the lens on the right side is blurred and slightly less dense. This is called a tra\\numatic cataract. Maybe you would have expected the lens to be more dense, but that is usually not the case. Globe rupture On the left CT images of a patient who had a left eye traum\\na. Study the images for 5 findings and then continue reading. The findings are : Globe rupture is seen most commonly at the anterior chamber. The termination of the retina is called\\n the ora serrata (arrows)\\nRetinal and choroidal detachment:\\nBlood can be located in the following locations: Retinal detachment can be distinguished from choroidal detachment, because the retinal epithelium ends at the ora serrata (figure). \\nEvidently a retinal detachment will not go beneath this point. Retinal detachment with haemorrhage is seen mostly in adults with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. In young infants\\n it can be seen as part of a shaken baby syndrome. In choroidal detachment recent intraocular surgery is the most common association followed by trauma. Retinal detachment On the fa\\nr left a CT of a choroidal detachment going beyond ten and two o'clock (with the lens at twlve o'clock) and evidently more anteriorly to the ora serrata. It looks as if the detachme\\nnt ends at the optic nerve but, if you look carefully, the choroidal detachment actually crosses the optic nerve. That would be very unusual for a retinal detachment, but is sometim\\nes seen in choroidal detachment. On the right a T1WI of a retinal detachment. It ends at the optic nerve and at the ora serrata. Choroidal detachment On the left an image of another\\n case of choroidal detachment. Bilateral colobomas\\nColoboma:\\nColoboma is a congenital malformation in which part of the eye does not form due to failure of fusion of an embryonic structure called the intraocular fissure. Often there is microp\\nhtalmia and the eye protrudes inferiorly. In 10% there are other CNS anomalies. On the left images of a patient with bilateral colobomas. Colobomas Coloboma can be part of the CHARG\\nE syndrome: Coloboma can also be part of the COACH syndrome: On the left images of a patient with a small coloboma at the entrance of the optic nerve. Agenesis of the corpus callosu\\nm with lipoma The patient on the left had a coloboma and also agenesis of the corpus callosum with an associated midline lipoma.\\nIntraconal pathology:\\nNeuromyelitis optica\\nDevic's syndrome:\\nDevic's syndrome is also known neuromyelitis optica. Let's first look at the images and then discuss it in more detail. On the left image there is a normal optic nerve on the right \\nside. Notice that the optic nerve is white matter tract. It has the same signal intensity as the white matter in the brain. On the contralateral side there is high signal intensity \\nin the optic nerve. This is therefore extra-ocular intraconal disease and we will be thinking of neoplastic versus demyelinating diseases. Continue with the next image. Neuromyeliti\\ns optica On the left a FLAIR image with fat-sat. Notice the abnormal signal intensity and the fact that the optic nerve is not enlarged, which argues against the possibility of a tu\\nmor. Devic's syndrome Images of the cervical spinal cord show a long segment of non-space occupying disease. Based on these images the differential diagnosis is MS and Devic's syndr\\nome (also caled neuromyelitis optica). Since MS is far more common, this would be the most likely diagnosis, but this happened to be Devic's syndrome. Some consider Devic's syndrome\\n as a form of MS, but Devic's syndrome differs from MS: Multiple sclerosis\\nMS:\\nOn the left images of a different patient, who also has optic neuritis. There is high signal in the optic nerve and in the brain there are multiple lesions as a result of MS. These \\nlesions did not occur at the same time, so there is dissemination in time and in place, which is specific for MS. Meningioma\\nMeningioma:\\nOn the left images of another patient with extra-ocular intraconal disease.

              " Document(page_content=\" the fact that the title of this paragraph is meningioma). The optic nerves are normal, but there is abnormal mass-like enhancement of the optic nerve sheath on the left. So this is\\n probably a neoplasm and of the neoplasms meningioma is by far the most common optic nerve sheath tumor. Meningiomas present with visual disturbances early in the course of the dise\\nase as a result of ischemic neuropathy due to venous obstruction. Clinically this presents as a pale disk. Abnormal enhancement of the optic nerve sheath On the left a table with th\\ne differential diagnosis of abnormal enhancement of the optic nerve sheath, also called \\noptic nerve tram track sign. Meningioma of nerve sheath is a result of subdural growth leading to progressive visual loss, papilledema, optic atrophy. There is a strong association \\nwith NF-2. The pale disk is due to venous outflow impairment. Calcifications are seen in 20-50%. Seeding into the subarachnoid space is another cause of abnormal ennhancement of the\\n optic sheath due to the fact, that the sheet of the optic nerve communicates with the intracranial compartment of the subarachnoid space). Optic glioma. CT and MR T1WI\\nOptic nerve glioma:\\nFirst look at the images on the left. Which side is abnormal and what is the most likely diagnosis? There is sphenoid wing hypoplasia on the right and on the left the optic nerve ne\\nar the chiasma is enlarged (visible on the MR). So the diagnosis is neurofibromatosis type I with sphenoid wing hypoplasia and an optic pathway glioma. Optic glioma in NF1 The term \\noptic nerve glioma is a misnomer. Actually the tumor can present anywhere along the optic tract from the occipital region to the chiasm and the optic nerve. The term glioma is also \\nrather non-specific. These tumors are juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas WHO type 1, which is the most benign form of astrocytoma. They make up 4% of all orbital tumors. More than 50% \\nof patients who have an optic nerve glioma have NF1, but in NF1 only about 10% have optic nerve glioma. They are less commonly cystic in NF than in non-NF. The mean age at diagnosis\\n is 4-5 years and only 20% of these patients have visual symptoms, because the glioma does not affect the optic nerve early and because these small children do not complain of visio\\nn problems. On the left another case with a more typical example of optic nerve glioma also in a patient with NF1. LEFT: multiple iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules) RIGHT: axillary fre\\nckling (small brown spots) and caf? au lait spots The criteria for the diagnosis of NF1 are met in an individual if 2 or more of the following signs are found:\\nConal pathology:\\nThyroid eye disease\\nThyroid eye disease:\\nTake a look at the images on the left, describe them and come up with a differential diagnosis and again disregard the title of this paragraph. The diagnosis is thyroid eye disease \\nand the differential diagnosis is pseudotumor of the orbit. In a moment we will discuss how to differentiate these two diseases. In the past the term Grave's ophtalmopathy was used.\\n This however suggested that the patient is hyperthyroid. Nowadays we know that patients that are treated for Graves disease can be euthyroid or even hypothyroid and still develop t\\nhyroid eye disease and therefore nowadays we use the term thyroid eye disease. The great danger of thyroid eye disease is compressive optic neuropathy either due to direct compressi\\non by the muscles or ischemic by compression of the vessels. The key feature to look for is the orbital apex. If you do not see any fat around the orbital apex, there is a great cha\\nnce of compression. These patients are treated with decompression through an endoscopic procedure in which the medial wall of the orbit i.e. the lamina papyracea is crushed. Pseudot\\numor of the orbit\\nPseudotumor:\\nTake a look at the images on the left. This is a case of pseudotumor. Pseudotumor is idiopathic inflammation of the orbit. It can affect every part of the orbit: muscles, tendons, f\\nat, optic nerve, nerve sheet, lacrimal gland etc. Thyroid eye disease versus pseudotumor The key distinction between pseudotumor and thyroid eye disease is the fact that in pseudotu\\nmor not only the muscles, but also the tendons are involved. These patients feel pain when they are moving their eyes as the tendons get irritated. On the image on the far left noti\\nce the tapering of the swollen muscle at the point of the tendinous insertion in a patient with thyroid eye disease. Next to it the images of the patient with pseudotumor. Notice th\\nat the swelling includes to the tendinus insertion.\\nExtraconal pathology:\\nPeriorbital abscess\\nPeriorbital abscess:\\nOn the left nonenhanced CT-images of a patient with a evident periosteal or periorbital abscess as a result of a complicated ethmoid sinusitis. The teaching point to make is the fol\\nlowing:\\nDo not wait for peripheral enhancement to call it an abscess! In every other location you wait for nice rim enhancement to call it an abscess and if not you say it is a phlegmone. T\\nhe treatment is the treatment of the sinusitis. Periorbital abscess Here MR-images of an eleven year old boy, who experienced some irritation of his right eye the night before and w\\noke up with a proptosis. The enhanced T1W-images with fatsat nicely demonstrate a periorbital abscess which causes the proptosis. Notice the ethmoid sinusitis. The other teaching po\\nint to make is the following:\\nIn children be very careful about extension outside the sinuses! Any change outside the sinus should be called an abscess. In children the periorbita is far more fenestrated and dis\\nease will easily spread. So be aggressive in calling small abnormalities an abscess. Periorbital abscess can lead to venous thrombosis of the superior and inferior ophtalmic vein. I\\nn certain fungal sinusitis (e.g.aspergillosis) you can even get cavernous sinus thrombosis and cavernous-carotid fistula Orbital cellulitis\\nOrbital and periorbital cellulitis:\\nOn the left images of a patient who presented in the ER with a 'red hot eye' and proptosis. Now the difference between orbital and periorbital cellulitis is an important one and is \\nbased on an anatomic structure, which is called the orbital septum. If a patient comes in the ER with a red hot eye and the inflammation includes the orbital septum and everything s\\nuperficial to it, the diagnosis is periorbital cellulitis and the patient is treated with oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis. In the case on the left however the structures pos\\nterior to the septum are also involved. This patient has an orbital cellulitis and will have to stay in the hospital to receive antibiotics intravenously. Fibrous dysplasia of the s\\nphenoid wing\\nSphenoid wing lesions:\\nOn the left a CT image of a patient with proptosis due to a sphenoid wing lesion. There are four sphenoid wing lesions that can cause proptosis: Meningioma with hyperostosis of sphe\\nnoid wing and proptosis These images are of a patient who had a slowly progressive proptosis. On the T2W-image the hyperostosis of the right sphenoid wing is seen, which corresponds\\n to the CT-image. Notice the small extra-axial lesion (arrow). This is a meningioma. On the coronal T1W-image post Gadolineum you can see the enhancement of the meningioma. When a m\\nenigioma grows like this along the neurocranium, it is also called a meningioma en plaque.\\nLacrimal gland lesions:\\nLacrimal gland lesions are listed in the table on the left.\\nInflammatory conditions are by far the most common lesions of the lacrimal gland (i.e. Sj?gren's, TB, fungus, pseudotumor).\\nThese conditions do not cause masses. The most common mass of the lacrimal gland is lymphoma followed by pleomorphic adenoma.\\nEpithelial tumors including adenoid cystic tumors are uncommon.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 80}),\n",

The Blood-Brain Barrier can be damaged by various diseases like: Understanding the patterns of enhancement in CNS disease will improv\\ne image assessment and differential diagnosis.\\nIn this article eleven patterns will be discussed with many examples. We want to honour James Smirniotopoulos, who teached us thinking in patterns, not just enhancement. \\nHis article in 2007 in Radiographics and his animated lectures inspired us writing this article.\\nHe was so kind to review this article.\\nIntroduction:\\nPattern approach:\\nIn this table the most common patterns of enhancement in CNS diseases are illustrated.\\nThe first three are extra-axial (diffuse and focal dural and leptomeningeal), while the others are all intra-axial patterns. You can click on the links below to go directly to examp\\nles of a specific pattern.\\nNormal enhancement:\\nStructures in the brain, that do not have a blood-brain barrier or structures that are extra-axial will show normal enhancement. These structures are the dura, the pineal gland (1),\\n vessels (2), the pituitary stalk (3) and pituitary gland (4), the choroid plexus (5) and the area postrema (arrow). The area postrema is a highly vascular paired structure in the m\\nedulla oblongata in the brainstem and is located just inferoposterior of the floor of the fourth ventricule.\\nDiffuse Dural pattern:\\nThe diffuse dural pattern of enhancement is a common finding in MR examinations.\\nIt is most commonly seen in post-surgery and intracranial hypotension. Normal dural enhancement The dura mater is an extra-axial structure and therefore does\\nnot have a blood-brain barrier. In half of the population enhancement can be seen on a\\ncontrast-enhanced MRI as a thin, smooth and discontinuous layer as seen in\\nthese images.\\nIntracranial hypotension:\\nIntracranial hypotension is a condition in which there\\nis abnormally low pressure or volume within the skull due to a reduction in\\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\\nThe classical presentation is a persistent orthostatic\\nheadache. Intracranial hypotension can be caused by surgery, lumbar puncture, ventricular drains and “spontaneous”\\nCSF leakage. Spontaneous CSF leakage is seen in an\\nanterior dural tear (type 1), a leaking nerve root diverticulum (type 2) or a\\nCSF-venous fistula (type 3).

An atypical meningioma is grade 2 and an anaplastic\\nmeningioma is grade 3. The meningo-endothelial cells arise from the arachnoid cap cells, which\\nis the inner most layer of the dura. On CT a meningioma is relatively hyperdense and may contain\\ncalcium. \\nWhen they contain calcium, they usually grow very slowly. On MRI a meningioma is iso-intense to the grey matter on T1-\\nand T2W-images. There is vivid enhancement due to the fact that the\\nextra-axial dural capillairies do not have a blood-brain barrier.

As many\\nas 65% of all abuse cases are initially seen in the emergency room, the first\\nstep in correctly identifying abuse is therefore to train hospital staff\\nmembers to recognize abuse indicators. The wide\\nrange of findings, which can mimic other disease processes or normal variants, implies\\nthat the definitive diagnosis of child abuse can only be achieved though\\ninterdisciplinary collaboration.\\nSeveral\\nstudies have reported that 30-80 % of confirmed physical child abuse cases were\\nmissed on initial presentation and many infants sustained additional injury\\nbecause of the delay in diagnosis. The\\nradiologist can be the first to suggest the diagnosis on the basis of imaging studies\\nperformed for  a wide range of clinical\\nindications. Other roles for the radiologist are listed in the table.\\nThe\\nfuture safety of a physically abused child partially rests on the radiologist's\\nperformance of these roles.\\nCNS injury:\\nBilateral hypoechoic subdural fluid collections that outline the arachnoid membrane very well (arrows). The cloudy aspect of the fluid suggests it is hemorrhagic. The subdural hemat\\nomas barely show any vessels in contrast with the abundant subarachnoid vessels.\\nSubdural hematoma:\\nCNS injury related to non-accidental injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children.\\nSome state that eighty percent of deaths of children under 2 years of age result from non-accidental head trauma. A baby's neck muscles are very weak and its head is large and heavy\\n in proportion to the rest of its body.\\nThe infant brain is poorly myelinated and is surrounded by larger subarachnoid spaces than the brain in older children and adults. When a baby is shaken, the neck snaps back and for\\nth, much like in a whiplash injury, causing the brain to rotate and hit the front and back of the skull. This can damage the brain and cause it to bruise, bleed and swell. \\nImaging studies of the head may show subdural or subarachnoid bleeding, diffuse axonal injury and associated cerebral edema or older injuries such as subdural effusions. Sorry, your\\n browser doesn't support embedded videos. This is a video of a color doppler in another child with bilateral subdural hematomas. Notice again that the subdural hematomas show no ves\\nsels in contrast with the abundant subarachnoid vessels.

Mosby, 3rd edition, 2015, 23 – 52.\\nSpecificity of fractures:\\nWhen we\\nlook at pediatric radiographs at the emergency department, we have to realize,\\nthat the forces needed to break a bone in an infant or young child are significant.\\nAny\\nfracture in this age group indicates a traumatic event. The\\nlevels of specificity for child abuse given a fracture are listed in the table\\non the left. The\\nclassical metaphyseal corner or bucket handle fracture is virtually\\npathognomonic for abuse, although a differential diagnosis does exist. Rib\\nfractures are very common and highly specific for abuse in young children less\\nthan 2 year. \\nThe positive predictive value of posterior rib fractures with\\nrespect to child abuse have been reported to be 80% - 90%. Fractures\\nof the acromion, sternum and spinous processes are so rare in accidental conditions,\\nthat this gives them a high specificity for abuse. Typical corner fracture very specific for non accidental trauma\\nCorner fracture:\\nThe metaphyseal\\ncorner fracture, also dubbed by Kleinman as the classic metaphyseal lesion,  was first described by Caffey who noted these\\npeculiar fractures in children with subdural hematomas. They are often\\nbilateral and in the distal tibia seen more often at the medial side. When a\\nsmall piece of bone is avulsed due to shearing forces on the fragile growth\\nplate it is seen as the typical corner fracture. These fractures are most\\ncommon in the tibia, distal femora and proximal humeri. They are frequently\\nbilateral. These\\nfractures are often subtle, and the likelihood of detection is directly related\\nto the quality of the radiologic studies. It is\\nfor this reason that skeletal surveys in cases of suspected child abuse must be\\nperformed with utmost attention to the quality of the radiographs.\\nBucket handle fractures:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 92}),\n",

Images\\nBucket handle fracture in proximal tibia. The metaphyseal fracture fragment is seen as a disk or bucket handle.\\nRib fractures:\\nIn\\nviolent shaking the child is held very tightly around the chest and squeezed\\nwhile being shaken. This compresses\\nthe ribs front to back and tends to break them next to their attachment to\\nvertebrae and laterally where they are being literally almost folded in half. As a\\nresult of this specific trauma mechanism, lateral and posterior rib fractures\\nare highly specific for abuse. Cardiopulmonary\\nresuscitation is rarely, if ever, a cause of such fractures. Old posterior rib fractures very indicative of non accidental trauma. These rib fractures in abused children may be foun\\nd incidentally on chest X-rays performed for other reasons, such as evaluation for pneumonia.\\nRib fractures are highly specific for abuse. In a study in the Netherlands a total of 254 fractures were found in 56 cases of abusive head trauma. There was an extremely high incide\\nnce of rib fractures and metaphyseal fractures (ref). Rib fractures pose difficulties similar to those of metaphyseal injuries in that they are easily overlooked on radiographs.\\nIn the acute stage they are not evident on radiographs, as little displacement occurs.\\nThey are often identified on the repeated skeletal survey when the fractures are in the healing stage showing callus. Especially\\nfractures at the ventral ends of the ribs are challenging. Ultrasonography\\nis helpful in detecting dislocation at the ventral costo-chondral junction. Images\\nChild evaluated for soft tissue mass in costchondral region.

RIGHT: skull fracture in abused child\\nSkull fractures:\\nSkull\\nfractures are common child abuse injuries, but they are also common in\\naccidental trauma. Patterns\\nof skull fracture that suggest child abuse are: The\\ninfant's skull is rather resistant to trauma, so any fracture that is not\\nconsistent with the history should raise the question of non-accidental injury. Two infants with a femur fracture. Child abuse was suspected because of the age of the child and an i\\nnconsistent history given by the parents.\\nDiaphyseal fractures:\\nDiaphyseal\\nfractures are non-specific as they do occur in both accidental and\\nnon-accidental injury.\\nHowever\\nin these cases the age and developmental stage of the child and the clinical\\nhistory is very important. A fall\\nout of a bed will usually not produce a diaphyseal fracture.\\nIn order\\nto acquire a transverse diaphyseal fracture of the femur a considerable amount\\nof power has to be applied. Spiral\\nfractures are a result of twisting forces.\\nAlthough\\noften stated there is no evidence that a spiral fracture of the lower extremity\\nhas a higher specificity of abuse compared to oblique or transverse fractures. Diaphyseal femur fracture with a lot of callus is at least 2 weeks old.\\nFracture healing:\\nCallus\\nin diaphyseal fractures generally forms no earlier than 5 days after a\\nfracture, but will usually form by 14 days.\\nThus,\\nfractures without visible callus may be up to 14 days old, and fractures which\\ndemonstrate a little bit of callus are at least 5 days old. Large amounts of\\ncallus indicate at least 2 weeks old. These\\nsigns can be used to correlate with the history. For instance a child that fell\\nout of bed the day before cannot have a fracture with callus formation.

Illne\\nss severity can vary from mild to critical.\\nPCR-test:\\nThe PCR-test is very specific, but has a lower sensitivity of 65-95%, which means that the test can be negative even when the patient is infected.\\nAnother problem is, that you have to wait for the test results, which can take more than 24 hours, while CT results are available right away.\\nCommon laboratory findings in COVID-19 are a decreased lymphocyte count and an increased CRP and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level.\\nChest CT:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nGround glass:\\nGround glass (GGO) pattern is the most common finding in COVID-19 infections.\\nThey are usually multifocal, bilateral and peripheral, but in the early phase of the disease the GGO may present as a unifocal lesion, most commonly located in the inferior lobe of \\nthe right lung (6).

Visual assessment\\nThe severity on CT can be estimated by visual assessment.\\nThis is the easiest way to score the severity.\\nThe CT images show a 25% involvement by visual assessment. Severity score\\nAnother method is by scoring the percentages of each of the five lobes that is involved: 75% involvement. The total CT score is the sum of the individual lobar scores and can range \\nfrom 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement), when all the five lobes show more than 75% involvement.\\nSome say that the percentage of lung involvement can be calculated by multiplying the total score times 4.\\nThis however is not true.

Modern Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) systems are modular. This means that the femoral stem, head, acetabular shell and liner are separate pieces. Thi\\ns modularity allows for greater flexibility in customizing prosthesis sizing and fit. The acetabular part is usually a polyethylene liner with or without metal backing. Fixation is \\nwith cement, spikes, screws or cementless with porous coating for bone ingrowth. The femoral part is composed of a metal stem (chromium cobalt or titanium) and a femoral head of met\\nal or ceramic. Stem-fixation is also either with cement or cementless with porous coating for bone ingrowth. Most modern non-cemented THA have a femoral stem with only proximal coat\\ning, as this results in a better longterm outcome\\nthan fully coated (less loosening). Some of the non-cemented THA have femoral stems with additional hydroxyapatite coating\\nwhich further improve bone ingrowth. This coating is not visible on radiographs. LEFT: Hybrid THA with cemented femoral stem and noncemented acetabular cup.RIGHT: Bone ingrowth arth\\nroplasty. Density lateral to femoral stem in Gruens zone I is a bone graft. Hybrid total hip replacements are a combination of cement- and cementless fixation. As cemented acetabula\\nr components have a tendency to loosen over time, the combination of a cementless acetabular component with a cemented femoral component is sometimes used. Overall there is a tenden\\ncy to use preferably non-cemented THA, which have better longterm results. On the left we see a hybrid THA with bone-ingrowth acetabular cup and cemented femoral component and next \\nto it a non-cemented bone ingrowth THA.\\nInitial Evaluation:\\nThe initial films serve as a baseline study and are used as reference films for comparison with all future studies, since sequential radiography is the most valuable method for dete\\ncting complications. The initial postoperative films are obtained to look for possible dislocation or fracture and to see if the prosthesis is good positioned. LEFT: Revision THA wi\\nth a large femoral stem with periprosthetic fracture.RIGHT: Cement extrusion intrapelvic through acetabular defect. Dislocation Dislocation can occur as a late complication in prost\\nheses that are not well positioned, but it is most common in the immediate postoperative period (incidence 3%). Periprosthetic fractures Fractures may be seen postoperatively in pat\\nients with poor bone stock and long stem revision prostheses or\\nwhen the anatomy is abnormal as in hip dysplasia. or prior surgery. They are also more common in non-cemented femoral stems, as these have to fit exactly and can cause a fracture du\\nring insertion. The incidence of fractures ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 percent for cemented components and 3 to 18 percent for uncemented components. Most intraoperative fractures occur \\non the femoral side. Cement extrusion When the acetabulum is prepared for placement of the cup a perforation may occur. This defect is filled with bone chips, cement or bone transpl\\nant.\\nCement extrusion is usually asymptomatic.\\n Rare complications include bowel fistulas, encasement of neurovascular structures and bladder wall burn. Measurement of lateral acetabular inclination. Right trochanter minor is lo\\nwer in position than the left indicating leg length dicrepancy.Normal horizontal center of rotation (red line).\\nAlignment and Positioning:\\nAcetabular and femoral component positioning should mimic normal anatomy. The distance from center of the femoral head to teardrop (or other identifiable landmark) should be equal b\\nilaterally. This is called the horizontal center of rotation. Excessive lateral positioning of the acetabular component increases the risk for dislocation and may cause limping. The\\n transischial line is used as a reference to measure the lateral inclination of the acetabular cup (30-50?). This line is also used to measure any leg length discrepancy. Leg length\\n discrepancy up to 1 cm is well tolerated. A high positionened cup is better tolerated than a lateral positioned cup. Different anteversion of the acetabular cup in the same patient\\n due to different rotation on a cross table view (left) compared to a lateral view (right). The anteversion of the acetabular cup should be 5-25?. Exact measurement of this angle on\\n a cross-table or true lateral radiograph is not possible\\n, since the apparent degree of angulation on a radiograph is affected by pelvic or thigh rotation (figure). Measurement with CT is more accurate, but you still have to compensate fo\\nr pelvic angulation. LEFT: Femoral head with large collar. Dislocation due to increased lateral inclination of acetabular cupRIGHT: Different patient at risk for dislocation. High a\\nnd lateral position of a steep acetabular cup. Notice polyethylene wear due to increased forces on the superolateral side of the cup. The following conditions predispose to dislocat\\nion: Increased lateral inclination of the acetabular cup. Decreased or increased anteversion of the cup. Excessive lateral positioning of the acetabular cup Increased or decreased a\\nnteversion of the femoral stem. Due to increased forces on the superolateral margin of the cup, increased lateral inclination of the acetabular\\ncomponent also may increase the risk of polyethylene wear of the acetabular liner (see figure). Varus position of femoral stem leading to loosening and fracture. The preferred posit\\nion of the femoral component is with the stem centered in the femoral canal. The center of rotation of the femoral head should be at the level of the tip of the greater trochanter. \\nVarus position of the femoral stem predisposes to loosening and fracture.\\nNormal Findings at Follow up:\\nLEFT: Normal cement-metal interface (yellow arrow). However loosening at cement-bone interface (orange curved arrow).RIGHT: At follow up also loosening at cement-metal interface.\\nCemented THA:\\nNormal findings in cemented-THA are different from non-cemented prostheses as the native bone shows more reactive changes to non-cemented prostheses. In cemented THA ideally you wou\\nld not expect any lucencies at the bone-cement or cement-prosthesis interface, but even in stable cemented prostheses they do occur. A lucency at the metal-cement interface along th\\ne proximal lateral aspect of the femoral stem may be seen on the initial postoperative radiograph as a reflection of suboptimal metal-cement contact at the time of surgery. A stable\\n lucent zone is good, but if the lucency enlarges or develops at the metal-cement interface during follow up, then it is a sign of loosening (figure). Ideally there is only a 3-4mm \\nlayer of cement around the prosthesis. Abundant cement packing leads to loosening. Acetabular zones according to De Lee and CharnleyFemoral zones according to Gruen At the bone-ceme\\nnt interface a thin fibrous layer may form as responce to local necrosis of osseous tissue due to the heat of the cement-polymerization. It becomes stable by 2 years. On radiographs\\n this layer is seen as a lucent zone. Especially in acetabular zone I a 1-2 mm lucency is frequently seen at the bone-cement interface, this is a normal finding provided it is stabl\\ne. If also other zones are involved and the lucency widens, it is however a sign of loosening. In your report always indicate which zones are involved (figure). In the acetabulum yo\\nu have three zones marked I-III. It is quite common to see a radio lucent line in zone I, but you shouldn't see it in zone II and III. Similarly in the femur there are zones 1 - 7. \\nIt is very common to see radiolucency in zone 1, occasionally in zone 7, but it should not occur in the subtrochanteric region zones 2-6. Manipulated image showing normal reactions \\nto the some of the uncemented hip prostheses.\\nNon Cemented THA:\\nThe implantation of a bone ingrowth prosthesis results in altered stress distribution to the native bone, especially in the older models with non tapered and fully coated femoral st\\nems. Stress shielding proximally may result in proximal osteoporosis and calcar resorption. Stress loading distally may result in cortical thickening and bridging sclerosis at the t\\nip of the prosthesis ( called pedestal). In an effort to avoid these changes, most modern cementless prosthesis only have fixation proximally, so you usually will not find proximal \\nstress shielding. The distal part of the femoral prosthesis is not 'loaded', so there will be no distal stress loading.

This fibrous tissue presents a\\ns a lucent zone at the interface. Again it should be stable and well within a range of 1 -2 mm. The figure on the left sums all the findings in some of the non-cemented prostheses, \\nthat can be normal. You have to be familiar with the normal and abnormal changes in the types of prostheses, that are used by your orthopaedic surgeons. Normal lucent zone: Thin luc\\nent zones along the bone-metal interface due to fibrous tissue are therefore common (80%). They should be less than 2mm and accompanied by a sclerotic line parallel to it. If they s\\ntay stable for 2 years than fixation by a strong fibrous tissue has taken place. Progressive calcar resorption during folllow up. Stress shielding or bone resorption is seen in area\\ns that are relatively unstressed. The forces are transmitted through the relative stiff femoral stem and is seen as osteoporosis in the\\nproximal femur with thinning of the cortex and bone resorption of the femoral neck. This is seen medially as calcar resorption, as the calcar has lost it's function (figure). It is \\nalso called calcar round off.\\nComplications at Follow Up:\\nThere are many complications in THA. Radiographic follow up and comparison with the oldest films available is the most valuable method of detecting these complications. The most imp\\nortant complications are mechanical loosening, particle disease and infection. These complications however may have similar imaging findings and overlap exists. Illustration of the \\ntypical radiographic changes in Loosening (left) - Particle disease (middle) - Infection (right) Mechanical loosening presents as diffuse lucency. Particle disease presents as focal\\n lucency. Evidence of polyethylene wear, which appears as asymmetric positioning of the femoral head within the acetabular cup, often coexists with particle disease.\\n. Infection presents as irregular lucency with periosteal reaction, but may be difficult to differentiate from loosening and particle disease.In typical cases the imaging findings o\\nf loosening, particle disease and infection are straight forward (figure). Infection is often low grade and is difficult to detect with any imaging method. In more agressive cases t\\nhere will be irregular osteolysis, no sclerotic border, cortical bone resorption and a periosteal reaction. Progressive lucent zone around acetabular component in zone I and II. Ste\\neper position of the cup indicates migration. Subtle excentric positioning of the femoral head is indicative of polyethylene wear.\\nLoosening:\\nMechanical loosening remains the most common indication for revision. Patients are usually symptomatic, although asymptomatic radiographic changes may be seen. The most common radio\\ngraphic manifestation of loosening are: Lucent zone > 2 mm at interface (indicative) Component migration (diagnostic). A lucent zone of more than 2 mm at the bone-prosthesis interfa\\nce or at the bone-cement interface is very indicative of loosening. Especially if more zones are involved and if there is progression. A lucent zone Component migration is diagnosti\\nc for loosening. It is seen as tilting or cranial migration of the acetabular cup or as subsidence (>10mm) and varus tilting of the femoral stem. The case on the left shows progress\\nive subsidence, which is diagnostic for loosening, with subsequent break of the screws. Loosening (2) As migration can be very subtle, it requires carefull comparison with the initi\\nal postoperative films. Do not just compare to the prior examination. The case on the left shows migration of the acetabular cup, which is better appreciated if a reference point is\\n used (see next figure) Same case as above with white marks on the tear drop figure. Migration is shown more easily. Blue arrow indicates acetabular fracture. If we look at the same\\n radiographs and we use the tear drop figure as a landmark, the migration becomes more evident. Migration of the cup in cranial direction has resulted in a fracture in the acetabula\\nr wall (blue arrow). Migration of acetabular cup cranially with tilting and subsequent acetabular fracture Migration of acetabular components is never acceptable. It is seen as upwa\\nrd movement or tilting of the cup (figure) The case on the left is for several reasons not ideal : High and very lateral positioning of the cup. Too much lateral inclination. Abunda\\nnt cement packing. Screws are positioned too horizontally (too much stress). Lucency in zone II and III > 2 mm. Especially lucency in these zones is very indicative of loosening. Du\\nring follow up upward migration with increased tilting is seen causing the fixation screw to break. Eccentric position of femoral head within cup consistent with polyethylene wear.F\\nocal osteolysis with endosteal scalloping in proximal femur due to particle disease.\\nParticle Disease:\\nOriginally this was called cement disease or aggressive granulomatosus. It is a histiocytic response that occurs as a result of macrophage reaction to any of the components, that ar\\ne shed of the surface of the components of the arthroplasty. Nowadays it is mostly seen in non-cemented hips as a reaction to small polyethylene wear particles. Radiographically the\\nse aggressive granulomatous lesions present as focal radiolucencies around the prosthesis. The condition tends to occur between 1 and 5 years after surgery and is associated with sm\\nooth endosteal scalloping. The key feature is that it produces no secondary bone response. These characteristics help to distinguish small particle disease from infection, which oft\\nen has more aggressive features, although the distinction is not always possible. Although particle disease is a result of polyethylene wear, you will not always see evident finding\\ns of polyethyleen wear in the acetabular cup,\\nbut whenever you see an eccentric position of the femoral head within the cup, look for focal lucencies. Large focal defects may be seen while the prosthesis is still stable. Partic\\nle Disease is relentlessly progressive with loosening, fracture and destruction of bone. Sometimes revision of a stable THA is needed because more bone loss would make revision surg\\nery impossible. Subtle eccentric position of femoral head. Even more subtle focal osteolysis around screw in acetabulum. Particle Disease (2) The small wear-particles of the polyeth\\nylene liner are shed into the joint fluid and can be transported around the prosthesis through small channels even in stable hips. They have a tendency to be transported through scr\\new holes (figure). This is why surgeons are more and more reluctant to use screws for the fixation of acetabular cups. Another case on the left. Again there is focal osteolysis arou\\nnd screws after migration of wear particles through the screwholes. Eccentric position of femoral head within acetabular cup as a result of polyethylene wear. Creep is normal remoul\\nding and is superomedial. Wear is superolateral and pathologic\\nPolyethylene wear:\\nNormal loading of the polyethylene cup comes up the femoral shaft, along the femoral neck towards the lumbar spine. So it is normal to see slight thinning in the area of the weight \\nbearing as the plastic moulds itself. This remoulding of the cup is called creep. Abnormal loading leads to pressure more lateral, resulting in polyethylene wear on the supero-later\\nal side.\\nInfection:\\nRadiologic findings in patients with low grade infection may be unremarkable or may mimic loosening or small particle disease. With more aggressive organisms, progression can be rap\\nid, with bone destruction and sinus tract formation, resulting in radiological findings as listed in the table on the left. Uniform criteria for the diagnosis of infection associate\\nd with prostheses have not been established. In several studies infection was diagnosed if at least one of the following criteria was present: Same microorganism in two cultures of \\nsynovial fluid. Purulence of synovial fluid at the implant site Inflammation on pathological examination of periprosthetic tissue. Presence of a sinus tract communicating with the p\\nrosthesis. Irregular periprosthetic bone resorption with periosteal reaction typical for infection. On the left the typical radiographic findings of infection with irregular bone de\\nstruction and periosteal reaction. In many cases however the infection is really low grade and difficult to establish. Radionuclide bone scans are very sensitive for infection, but \\nnot specific as they may show findings similar to those occurring in loosening. Negative findings on a bone scan suggest that no infection exists. The role of dedicated radionuclide\\n techniques for infection such as gallium scanning or indium-labeled WBC or immunoglobulin G is not clear,\\nbut they tend to be a bit more specific compared to normal Technetium bone scan. Most researchers advocate fluoroscopic or sonographic guided joint aspiration to assess infection. S\\neveral samples should be taken to minimize confusion caused by skin contaminants. Infections up to one year after the insertion of the prosthesis are acquired during implantation. T\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 99}),\n",

Lateral dislocation of THA\\nDislocation:\\nAs discussed above, dislocation or subluxation of the components may occur because of patient factors including poor muscle tone or trauma or because of surgical factors such as a p\\nosterior (rather than lateral) surgical approach. Another factor is difficulty in achieving ideal angulation of the acetabular component. This is usually the result of severe degene\\nrative changes or dysplasia. Dislocation can be in posterior, anterior or lateral direction.

The case on the left is probably secondary to severe polyethylene wear\\nresulting in cup and cement fracture.

Destruction of polyethylene liner The case on the left shows severe wear and fracture of the polyethylene liner. The metal backing is still intact.

Classification of heterotopic ossification according to Brooker\\nHeterotopic Ossification:\\nThe classification of heterotopic ossification includes four grades based on an AP radiograph of the pelvis and hip. Grade I = islands of bone within soft tissues. Grade II = bone s\\npurs leaving > 1 cm between opposing bone surfaces. Grade III = bone spurs leaving < 1 cm between opposing bone surfaces. Grade IV = radiographic ankylosis of the hip. Various degre\\nes of heterotopic ossification Heterotopic Ossification occurs when primitive mesenchymal cells in the surrounding soft tissues are transformed into osteoblastic cells, that form ma\\nture lamellar bone. It typically occurs around the femoral neck and adjacent to the greater trochanter and occurs in 15-50% of patients. Many patients with radiographically low-grad\\ne heterotopic ossification are asymptomatic. If it becomes symptomatic, hip stiffness is the most common complaint and pain is rarely a problem.\\nArthrography:\\nAll the profits of the Radiology Assistant go to Medical Action Myanmar which is run by Dr. Nini Tun and Dr. Frank Smithuis sr, who is a professor at Oxford university and happens t\\no be the brother of Robin Smithuis.

Bosniak I and Bosniak II masses that are characterize\\nd as benign may be described as “cysts” and the term “cystic renal mass” should be applied to Bosniak IIF, III and IV lesions. Terms such as ‘complicated cyst’ or ‘complex cyst’ can\\n be confusing and should be avoided. Bosniak I Bosniak II Six types, all well-defined with thin (≤ 2 mm) smooth walls: Bosniak IIF Two types: Bosniak III One or more enhancing thick\\n (≥ 4 mm width) or enhancing irregular (displaying ≤ 3-mm obtusely margined convex protrusion[s]) walls or septa. Bosniak IV One or more enhancing nodules (≥ 4-mm convex protrusion \\nwith obtuse margins, or a convex protrusion of any size that has acute margins) This table summarizes the Bosniak 2019 classification.. Portal venous scan of a cyst with mean HU of \\n25 in the anterior right Kidney. According to the new Bosniak criteria all cyst with HU <30 are likely benign and can be classified as Bosniak II without any additional imaging\\nMalignancy rate:\\nBosniak I masses are universally considered to be benign, and although there are occasional case reports of malignancy being found in these lesions, this is thought to be due to inc\\norrect scan technique or incorrect image interpretation leading to incorrectly assigning a Bosniak I grade. Malignancy rates in Bosniak II lesions are <1% and may be as low a 0%. A \\ncaveat to this is in patients with Von Hippel Lindau syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and other RCC syndromes where benign appearing cystic masses may still harbor malignancy and\\n the application of the Bosniak system is not recommended. The incidence of malignancy in Bosniak IIF lesions is reported between 0-38% likely owing to differences in subjective gra\\nding of imaging features as well as strong selection bias whereby only the more worrisome lesions are resected. However, lesions in which there is progression of features from IIF t\\no category III or IV have a high rate of malignancy of 85%, comparable to lesions initially characterised as Bosniak IV. Bosniak III lesions are considered indeterminate with around\\n half being malignant. Current practice regarding resection or observation varies between institutions and depends heavily on lesion size, patient comorbidities and surgeon preferen\\nce. Bosniak IV lesions are found to be malignant in around 90% of cases and treatment is recommended in most cases if patient characteristics allow The system is used to predict the\\n likelihood of cancer, not the biologic behavior. \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

Solid renal tumor with small cystic or\\n necrotic components\\nWhen not to apply Bosniak:\\nThe Bosniak classification should not be applied to lesions with an infectious, inflammatory or vascular etiology. Lesions with a solid component of > 25% are likely necrotic solid \\nmasses. These necrotic solid masses, as opposed to cystic masses, have a less indolent behavior. \\nIt is therefore important not to confuse indolent cystic cancer with more aggressive forms. Lesions with abundant thick nodular calcifications on CT can mask enhancement. In these l\\nesions MRI with subtraction is advised to rule out enhancing soft tissue components. Hyperattenuating non-enhancing lesions larger than 3 cm and heterogeneous non-enhancing lesions \\non CT can also benefit from further evaluation with MRI to exclude enhancement before assigning a Bosniak category. case 1\\nCT of a solid lesion with smaller cystic/necrotic components. \\nAs more than 25% of the mass is composed of solid tissue this likely represents a necrotic mass in stead of a cystic lesion. \\nBosniak criteria should not be used.

Renal abscess case 3There is a non-en\\nhancing area in the left kidney on the T1W-image.\\nThis area has low values in the ADC map in keeping with diffusion restriction. This proved to be an abscess.\\nDefinitions:\\nSepta:\\nA septum is defined as a linear or curvilinear structure that connects two surfaces. Up to 3 septa are considered “few” and in keeping with a Bosniak II lesion.\\n4 or more septa are termed “many” and if enhancing are features of a 2F lesion (in the absence of more worrisome features) In the left diagram there are 2 septa connecting two surfa\\nces (Bosniak II), and in the right diagram there are 5 different septa, defined as Bosniak IIF.\\nEnhancement:\\nPrior versions of the Bosniak classification divided enhancement between “perceived” and measurable, and all masses in which an area of enhancement could be measured could only be c\\nategorised as Bosniak III or IV. However, there was no evidence base for the distinction between perceived and measurable enhancement increasing risk of malignancy In the 2019 class\\nification all enhancement is considered equal. \\nEnhancement can be unequivocally perceived when comparing non-contrast and contrast-enhanced images performed using the same acquisition technique or ‘measurable’ using conventional\\nly sized regions of interest” (not pixel values).\\nSpecifically an increase of ≥20 HU on contrast-enhanced CT, or ≥15% signal intensity on contrast enhanced MR.

On the T1W fatsat after contrast, these septa show obvi\\nous enhancement in comparison to the pre-contrast sequence. \\nA cyst with many, thin septa is categorized as a Bosniak IIF\\nSeptal and wall thickness:\\nAlthough there is still likely to be some inter observer variation in the measurement of enhancing septal and wall thickness, the new 2019 guidance provides values for thickness in \\neach Bosniak category, replacing the prior descriptive classification of “minimally thickened” or “thickened”. A cyst with smooth thin enhancing wall ≤ 2mm thickness without septa i\\ns considered a Bosniak I cyst. A smooth ≤ 2mm enhancing wall with 1-3 septa ≤ 2mm thickness is Bosniak II A smooth and minimally thickened wall or septa (3mm) is considered Bosniak \\nIIF Any smoothly thickened wall or septa ≥ 4mm is categorized as Bosniak III.\\nWall irregularity and Nodularity:\\nThe distinction between irregularity of enhancing wall or septa and a nodule relates to the angle formed with the associated wall or septum and the thickness. Enhancing areas which \\nform acute angles with a wall or septum are considered nodules and are always categorized as Bosniak IV features. Enhancing areas which form obtuse margins with the septal or mural \\nsurface are considered thickening if ≤3mm. An enhancing area with obtuse margins is considered a nodule if ≥4mm when measured perpendicular to the underlying surface. If an area of \\nobtuse angled thickening is present on both sides of a septum then the combined thickness on both sides of the septum should be measured, excluding the thickness of the underlying s\\neptum itself. This table summarizes the different measurements of the wall and septal thickness in the Bosniak classification.\\nBosniak I:\\nOn contrast CT Bosniak I cyst are well defined with a thin (≤2mm) smooth wall and contain homogenous, simple fluid (-9 – 20 HU) and no septa or calcifications.

Most incidental kidney lesions are detected on single phase portal venous stu\\ndies. If these lesions are homogeneous and have a HU of 21-30, malignancy is highly unlikely and Bosniak II can be applied. Masses that are evaluated with a renal specific contrast \\nprotocol and have a HU of > 20 and show no enhancement are also assigned Bosniak II. All thin walled cystic masses with enhancing septa and/or any type of calcification can now be c\\nategorized as Bosniak II, as long as the septa are few (1-3) and thin (≤ 2mm). Homogeneous masses with Houndsfield units of -9-20 or ≥70 on non-contrast CT, as well as lesions -too \\nsmall to characterize- but otherwise homogeneous and low-attenuating, can be placed in the Bosniak II category. Many masses are discovered incidentally on CT or MR examinations perf\\normed for other indications not using a dedicated renal imaging protocol.

Nodules are defined as focal enhancing convex protrusions of any size with acute angles to the septa or wall or a pr\\notrusion of over 4 mm with obtuse margins with the wall or septa. Cystic masses with soft tissue components > 25% are no longer cystic masses but necrotic solid masses and the Bosni\\nak criteria do no longer apply to these masses. case 1 The images show a complex large right renal cyst with T1 and T2 hyperintense internal fluid and T1 hyperintense debris, which \\nshows mild enhancement on the subtraction image.

It also is the site of origin of ductal carcinoma in situ (D\\nCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ, fibroadenoma and fibrocystic disease, like cysts, apocine metaplasia, adenosis and epitheliosis. Most calcifications in the breast form either withi\\nn the terminal ducts (intraductal calcifications) or within the acini (lobular calcifications). LEFT: Lobular calcifications: punctate, round or 'milk of calcium' RIGHT: Intraductal\\n calcifications: pleomorph and form casts in a linear or branching distribution. Lobular calcifications These calcifications fill the acini, which are often dilated. This results in\\n uniform, homogeneous and sharply outlined calcifications, that are often punctate or round. When the acini become very large, as in cystic hyperplasia, 'milk of calcium' may fill t\\nhese cavities. However when there is more fibrosis, as in sclerosing adenosis, the calcifications are usually smaller and less uniform. In these cases it can be difficult to differe\\nntiate them from intraductal calcifications. Lobular calcifications usually have a diffuse or scattered distribution, since most of the breast is involved in the process that forms \\nthe calcifications. Lobular calcifications are almost always benign. Intraductal calcifications These calcifications are calcified cellular debris or secretions within the intraduct\\nal lumen. The uneven calcification of the cellular debris explains the fragmentation and irregular contours of the calcifications. These calcifications are extremely variable in siz\\ne, density and form (i.e. pleomorphic from the Greek pleion 'more' and morphe 'form').\\n Sometimes they form a complete cast of the ductal lumen. This explains why they often have a fine linear or branching form and distribution. Intraductal calcifications are suspicio\\nus of malignancy and are classified as BI-RADS 4 or 5.\\nDiagnostic Approach:\\nThe diagnostic approach to breast calcifications is to analyze the morphology, distribution and sometimes change over time. The form or morphology of calcifications is the most impo\\nrtant factor in deciding whether calcifications are typically benign or not. If not, they are either suspicious (intermediate concern) or of a high probability of malignancy. Usuall\\ny biopsy in these cases is needed to determine the etiology of these calcifications.\\nMorphology:\\nThe form of calcifications is the most important factor in the differentiation between benign and malignant. If calcifications cannot be readily identified as typically benign or as\\n 'high probability of malignancy', they are termed of 'intermediate concern or suspicious'. If a specific etiology cannot be given, a description of the calcifications should includ\\ne their morphology and distribution using the descriptions given in the BI-RADS atlas (1).\\nDistribution:\\nIn the BI-RADS atlas the following descriptions are given for the distribution of calcifications (1) : Diffuse or scattered distribution is typically seen in benign entities. Even w\\nhen clusters of calcifications are scattered throughout the breast, this favors a benign entity. Regional distribution according to the BI-RADS atlas would favor a non-ductal distri\\nbution (i.e. benignity), while Segmental distribution would favor a ductal distribution (i.e. malignancy). Sometimes this differentiation can be made, but in many cases the differen\\ntiation between 'regional' and 'segmental' is problematic, because it is not clear on a mammogram or MRI where the bounderies of a segment (or a lobe) exactly are. Clustered calcifi\\ncations are both seen in benign and malignant disease and are of intermediate concern. When clusters are scattered througout the breast, this favors a benign entity. A single cluste\\nr of calcification favors a malignant entity. Linear distribution is typically seen when DCIS fills the entire duct and its branches with calcifications.\\nChange over time:\\nThere are conflicting data concerning the value of absence of change over time. It is said that the absence of interval change in microcalcifications that are probably benign on the\\n basis of morphologic criteria is a reassuring sign and an indication for continued mammographic follow-up (2). On the other hand in a retrospective study that included indeterminat\\ne and suspicious clusters of microcalcifications, stability could not be relied on as a reassuring sign of benignancy (3). In this group of patients with biopsy proven malignancy, 2\\n5% of patients had stable microcalcifications for 8-63 months. It seems that the morphology of calcifications is far more important than stability and stability can only be relied o\\nn if the calcifications have a probably benign form. In the same study it was shown that the odds for invasive carcinoma versus DCIS are statistically significantly higher among pat\\nients with increasing or new microcalcifications. The likelihood that carcinoma will be invasive increases significantly when a suspicious or indeterminate cluster of calcifications\\n is new or increasing. On the left a patient with a few heterogeneous coarse calcifications. They were classified as BIRADS 3 (probably benign with a likelihood of malignancy less t\\nhan 3%). At six month follow up they had increased in number and DCIS was found at biopsy.\\nBenign Calcifications:\\nSkin Calcifications - Tatoo sign:\\nMany calcifications can be classified as typically benign and need no follow up (i.e. BI-RADS 1 or 2). Many of these are skin calcifications. These are usually lucent-centered depos\\nits. Atypical forms may be confirmed by tangential views to be in the skin. Usually they are located along the inframammary fold parasternally and in the axilla and areola. When you\\n consider the possibility of dermal calcifications, always study the portion of the skin that is seen en face to look for similar calcifications (arrow). Tattoo sign in dermal calci\\nfications Tatoo sign Skin calcifications may simulate parenchymal breast calcifications and may look like malignant-type calcifications. The cluster calcifications on the left was p\\nresented for biopsy. During the vacuum assisted biopsy procedure it was not possible to biopsy these calcifications, because they were out of range. When you look at the oblique and\\n craniocaudal view, notice that the calcifications look exactly the same in configuration. This is called the tattoo sign . Spot views subsequently prooved that these were dermal ca\\nlcifications. Click to enlarge Here another example of the tatoo-sign. First notice that there are some calcifications that are clearly located within the skin (arrows). The cluster\\n calcifications on the MLO-view has the exact configuration as the cluster on the CC-view (next image). Click to enlarge On the CC-view the configuration of the microcalcifications \\nis exactly the same. If these calcifications were located in the centre of the breast they should have a different configuration, because the projection is different. Only when calc\\nifications are located within the skin their configuration stays the same.\\nTatoo sign video:\\nHere two cases of skin calcifications presenting as tatoo sign (courtesy Roel Mus).\\nVascular Calcifications:\\nThese are linear or form parallel tracks, that are usually clearly associated with blood vessels.

These benign calcifications form continuous rods that may occasionally be branching. They are different from malignant-type fine branching cal\\ncifications, because they are usually > 1 mm in diameter. They may have lucent centers if the calcium is in the wall of the duct. These calcifications follow a ductal distribution, \\nradiating toward the nipple and are usually bilateral. These secretory calcifications are most often seen in women older than 60 years. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate th\\nese from lineair calcifications as seen in DCIS.\\nRound and punctate calcifications:\\nRound calcifications are 0.5-1 mm in size and frequently form in the acini of the terminal duct lobular unit. When smaller than 0.5 mm, the term 'punctate' is used. Round and puncta\\nte calcifications can be seen in fibrocystic changes or adenosis, skin calcifications, skin talc and rarely in DCIS. Suspect DCIS when the calcifications are small, i.e. punctate , \\nand show some heterogeneity especially when in cluster, linear or segmental distribution. Round and punctate calcifications are classified as:\\nLucent-Centered:\\nThese are round or oval calcifications that range from under 1 mm to over a centimeter. They are the result of fat necrosis, calcified debris in ducts, and occasional fibroadenomas.\\nEggshell or Rim Calcifications:\\nThese are very thin benign calcifications that appear as calcium is deposited on the surface of a sphere. These deposits are usually under 1 mm in thickness when viewed on edge. Alt\\nhough fat necrosis can produce these thin deposits, calcifications in the wall of cysts are the most common 'rim' calcifications. On the left a sharply defined lesion. The low densi\\nty indicates the presence of fat. This is a typical oil cyst. On a follow up mamogram the wall has calcified resulting in eggshel calcifications.\\nMilk of Calcium:\\nThese are benign sedimented calcifications in macro- or microcysts. On craniocaudad views they appear as fuzzy, round or amorphous. Consider magnification spot film with horizontal \\nbeam when you think of the possibility of milk of calcium, because on a 90? lateral view they may appear as semilunar, crescent shaped tea cups. LEFT: cluster of pleiomorphic calcif\\nications on oblique viewRIGHT: milk of calcium (teacups) on lateral view with horizontal beam Many calcifications representing milk of calcium within microcysts however do not layer\\n on horizontal beam radiographs. The most important feature of these calcifications is the apparent change in shape of the calcific particles on different mammographic projections (\\ncraniocaudal versus oblique or 90? lateral). The images show a different shape on the oblique view compared to the mediolateral view. On the mediolateral view there is layering of t\\nhe calcium. Milk of calcium On the craniocaudal image the calcifications are round, fuzzy and ill-defined. On the mediolateral view the calcifications appear as semilunar, crescent \\nshaped tea cups. Click on the image for an enlarged view.\\nSuture calcifications:\\nThey represent calcium deposit on suture material. They are typically linear or tubular in appearance and knots are sometimes visible.\\nDystrophic calcifications:\\nThese are coarse irregular 'lava-shaped' calcifications. These calcifications are larger than 0.5 mm and often have a lucent center. They are seen in irradiated breast or following \\ntrauma. They develop 3-5 years after treatment in about 30% of women. These calcifications are also described as fat necrosis. It is important to differentiate them from a recurrent\\n malignancy. On the left more extensive dystrophic calcifications.\\nSuspicious Calcifications:\\nIf calcifications are not typically benign, they are either called 'Suspicious or of Intermediate Concern' or they are called 'High Probability of Malignancy'. We will first discuss\\n suspicious calcifications. These calcifications have either an amorphous or coarse heterogeneous form. Usually these calcifications are biopsied to determine their exact nature.\\nAmorphous calcifications:\\nAmorphous or indistinct calcifications are defined as 'without a clearly defined shape or form'. These calcifications are usually so small or hazy in appearance, that a more specifi\\nc morphologic classification cannot be determined. On the left amorphous and pleomorphic calcifications. Based on the morphology these calcifications were classified as BI-RADS 4. B\\niopsy revealed fibrocystic changes (FCC) Amorphous calcifications (2) Many benign and malignant breast diseases may present with amorphous calcifications (Table). About 20% of amorp\\nhous calcifications turn out to be malignant. Usually it is low grade DCIS. Amorphous calcifications (3) On the left amorphous calcifications within a denser area of the breast. Thi\\ns was classified as Bi-RADS 4 (3-95% chance of malignancy). Biopsy revealed DCIS with invasive ductal carcinoma.\\nCoarse Heterogeneous:\\nCoarse heterogeneous microcalcifications, formerly called coarse granular, are irregular, conspicuous calcifications that are generally larger than 0.5 mm. They are considered to be\\n of intermediate concern, along with amorphous microcalcifications. They have to be differentiated from fine pleomorphic microcalcifications, formerly called fine granular, that var\\ny in size and shape, are usually less than 0.5 mm in diameter and are considered to be of higher probability of malignancy, along with the fine linear microcalcifications (1). Coars\\ne heterogeneous microcalcifications tend to coalesce but are not the size of the larger irregular dystrophic calcifications. On the left coarse heterogeneous calcifications They wer\\ne classified as Bi-RADS 4. Biopsy revealed DCIS. Coarse heterogeneous calcifications in fibrous stroma The differential diagnosis of coarse heterogeneous calcifications includes: Mu\\nltiplicity and bilaterality of such calcifications favors a benign etiology. DCIS is considered when these calcifications have a clustered, linear or segmental distribution. On the \\nleft a patient in whom new calcifications were detected during follow up for breastcancer in the contralateral breast. There are coarse heterogeneous calcifications in a segmented d\\nistribution. These calcifications were classified as Bi-RADS 4. Biopsy showed calcifications within fibrous stroma. There was no sign of malignancy.\\nHigh Probability of Malignancy:\\nCalcifications with a higher probability of malignancy are: Magnified view: fine pleomorphic calcifications in a linear distribution. Biopsy: High grade DCIS\\nFine Pleomorphic:\\nThese calcifications vary in size and shapes and are usually. \\nThey are more conspicuous than the amorphic calcifications. There is a 25-40% risk of malignancy. On the left fine pleomorphic calcifications in a segmental and linear distribution.\\n These were classified as BI-RADS 4B. Biopsy revealed high grade DCIS.

This can help to keep patients wi\\nth a high suspicion of COVID-19 infection separate from patients with other diseases, especially when the PCR-test is false negative.

It is a preliminary\\n classification of likelyhood of COVID-19 infection as proposed by the COVID working group of the Dutch Radiological Society. The interpretation of the CT findings has to be combine\\nd with the clinical symptoms and the duration of the symptoms as a CT can be negative in the first few days of a mild infection.\\nHowever most patients that we see have complaints for a week or more. At the moment most patients that are admitted to the hospital either have a CORADS 5, which means that they hav\\ne a COVID-19 infection or they have a CORADS 1 or 2, which means no COVID-19 infection.\\nImaging Findings in suspected COVID-19:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\n_1 Crazy paving - ventilation:\\nHistory\\n64 year old male with fever and coughing for 2 weeks after a skiing holiday with his family.

Cad-Rads 1 category also includes the presenc\\ne of plaque with positive remodeling but no stenosis. Cad-Rads 4 category is divided into two subcategories: In patients with CAD-RADS 4A the next step can be ICA or functional asse\\nssment, i.e. CT-FFR, CTP, stress testing (exercise tolerance test, stress echocardiogram, SPECT, PET or cardiac MRI).\\nIn patients with Cad-Rads 4B ICA is recommended.

High-risk plaque features include: low-attenuation plaque, positive remodeling,\\nspotty calcification and napkin-ring sign. If two or more of these\\nfeatures are present modifier “HRP” should be added to the CAD-RADS category. There are three plaque types on coronary CTA: Calcified plaque is an atherosclerotic plaque in which th\\ne entire plaque appears as\\ncalcium density (>130 HU on non-enhanced CT). The previous terminology “hard plaque” is not recommended. Partially calcified plaque is an atherosclerotic lesion with 2\\ncomponents of which one is calcification. The previous term was “mixed plaque”, which is no longer recommended. Non-calcified plaque is a plaque without calcium content.

Stable plaques On histology, stable plaques are characterized by large calcifications,\\nfibrotic tissue and smaller lipid pools. High-risk plaques Conversely, unstable plaques can contain spotty calcifications, large-lipid\\npool (necrotic core), which is covered by a thin fibrous cap. These\\nplaques are sometimes referred to as thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA). \\nSome of\\nthese high-risk plaque features can be identified by CTA. Low-attenuation plaque (HU=14) with severe (70-99%) stenosis in the LAD.\\nLow-attenuation plaque:\\nLesions associated with plaque rupture frequently have a large lipid rich core. \\nLipid on CT appears as low attenuation. \\nPlaques with < 30 HU on CTA were found to be present significantly more often in patients with acute coronary syndrome (9).\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 111}),\n",

In \\npulsatile tinnitus, the auditory perception is repetitively synchronous to the patient’s heartbeat. All other auditory perceptions are considered non-pulsatile. Less than 10% of pat\\nients presenting with tinnitus have pulsatile tinnitus. In about 70% of the cases with pulsatile tinnitus, an underlying cause can be identified by adequate diagnostic work-up as sh\\nown on the flow chart. Left sided vestibular schwannoma.

              " Document(page_content='Non-pulsatile tinnitus:\\nNon-pulsatile tinnitus is almost always subjective.\\nDifferent underlying conditions relate to the development of non-pulsatile tinnitus, including cerumen impaction, middle ear infection, medications, noise-induced hearing loss, pres\\nbycusis or chronic bilateral hearing loss, hemorrhage, neurodegeneration, and spontaneous intracranial hypotension [2]. MRI is only recommended in patients with unilateral (non-puls\\natile) tinnitus with focal neurological abnormalities, or asymmetric hearing loss [4]. The main purpose of diagnostic imaging is to identify or rule out a lesion in the cerebellopon\\ntine angle cistern, (e.g. vestibular schwannoma). \\nLabyrinthine abnormalities can be identified on MRI supporting the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease [3].\\nPulsatile tinnitus:\\n+++ Most optimal, ++ good, + moderate, ± indirect signs, – not suitable, LCH Langerhans cell histiocytosis, ICA internal carotid artery, FMD fibromuscular dysplasia\\nPathology and imaging:\\nYou can click on the table for a large view. For screening for underlying pathology and for the evaluation of a possible soft tissue mass or intracranial pathology, initial evaluati\\non with MRI and MR angiography (MRA) is recommended with reported high diagnostic accuracy. For the evaluation of osseous pathology of the temporal bone, a limited scanning range of\\n thin-sliced (submillimetric) CT is sufficient. Multi-detector CTA or CT venography (CTV) of the head and neck region can be performed for the evaluation of vascular pathology. Dyna\\nmic CTA, also referred to as 4D-CTA, is a technique that combines the non-invasive nature of CTA with the dynamic acquisition of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The role of c\\nonventional angiography (DSA) in the diagnostic work-up of pulsatile tinnitus has been minimized, and should be reserved for the indication to rule out vascular pathology in case MR\\nI/MRA and CT/(4D-)CTA have not revealed the cause of pulsatile tinnitus. The role of duplex ultrasound in the diagnostic work-up of pulsatile tinnitus is limited, although duplex ul\\ntrasound is an effective screening tool for the evaluation of vessel wall pathology of the carotid arteries, e.g. stenosis and occlusion. \\nDuring ultrasound, manual compression can be performed to investigate the influence of compression on tinnitus. Otosclerosis: hypoattenuated bone in the region of the fissula ante f\\nenestram in fenestral otosclerosis (left). Cochlear otosclerosis appears as a hypoattenuated halo surrounding the cochlea on CT (right).\\nTemporal bone pathology:\\nTemporal bone pathology like otosclerosis, Paget disease, and LCH can cause pulsatile tinnitus. Otosclerosis\\nIs also known as otospongiosis, is an idiopathic infiltrative process of the petrous bone. \\nIt causes both sensorineural and conductive hearing loss, and can be the cause of pulsatile tinnitus. High-resolution, thin-sliced CT typically shows abnormal hypoattenuated bone in\\n the region of the fissula ante fenestram in fenestral otosclerosis (left). Cochlear otosclerosis \\nThis appears as a hypoattenuated halo surrounding the cochlea on CT (right). Langerhans cell histiocytosis arising from the jugular foramen Langerhans cell histiocytosis \\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare benign disorder of clonal histiocyte proliferation.\\nClinical symptoms in LCH depend on the extent of bone and extraskeletal involvement.

We will discuss the followi\\nng subjects: There is an important role for MRI in the diagnosis of MS, since MRI can show multiple lesions - dissemination in space, many of which are clinically occult already at \\nthe time of first presentation, and MRI can show new lesions on follow up scans - dissemination in time, much earlier than new symptoms develop.\\nIntroduction:\\n* In elderly patients or patients with cardiovascular risk factors it is better to look for at least 3 periventricular lesions\\nMcDonald criteria:\\nMore information:\\nDiagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2017 revisions of the McDonald criteria Multiple sclerosis is the most common inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in yo\\nung and middle-age adults, but may also affect older people. According to the McDonald criteria for MS, the diagnosis requires objective evidence of lesions disseminated in time and\\n space, either clinically or radiologically and elimination of more likely diagnoses. There is an important role for MRI in the diagnosis of MS, since MRI can show multiple lesions \\n(dissemination in space), many of which are clinically occult already at the time of first presentation, and MRI can show new lesions on follow up scans (dissemination in time) much\\n earlier than new symptoms develop. The McDonald criteria are very specific, because if you want to use MRI for the diagnosis of MS, you must confrim that the patient really has MS.\\nYou do not want a patient to start treatment daily if there is any doubt about the diagnosis. Dissemination in Space For dissemination in space (DIS) lesions in two out of four typi\\ncal areas of the CNS are required: Dissemination in time For dissemination in time (DIT) there are two possibilities: On the far left a new T2 hyperintense lesion on a follow-up exa\\nmination 3 months after the first clinical event. The images on the right show a new enhancing lesion on a follow up scan. Click for larger view Typical locations of MS lesions\\nThis is a coronal T2 image of a brain specimen with MS involvement. The lesions in the deep white matter (yellow arrow) are nonspecific and can be seen in many diseases.

              " Document(page_content='Juxtacortical lesions:\\nJuxtacortical and cortical lesions are specific for MS.\\nThey are adjacent to the cortex and must touch the cortex (yellow circle). In small vessel disease the U-fibers are typically spared and on T2 and FLAIR there will be a dark band of\\n normal WM between the WML and the bright cortex (white circle). Do not use the word subcortical to describe this location, because that is a less specific term, indicating a larger\\n area of white matter almost reaching the ventricles. Juxtacortical MS lesion located in the U-fiber. You really have to look hard to notice juxtacortical lesions  because they are \\ndifficult to differentiate from the hyperintense cortex.

RIGHT: Multiple lesions and edema around enhancing lesion on T2WI.\\nDawson fingers:\\nTypical findings for MS as seen in this case are: Dawson fingers are typical for MS.\\nThey represent areas of demyelination along the small cerebral veins that run perpendicular to the ventricles.\\nIf needed this can be demonstrated using SWI The enhancement will be present for about one month after the occurrence of a lesion. Symmetrical brainstem lesions in SVD (left) compar\\ned to typical asymmetrical MS lesions (right)\\nBrainstem lesions:\\nIn MS brainstem lesions are typically peripheral. In small vessel disease there may be involvement of the brainstem, but it is usually symmetrical and central.\\nTemporal lobe involvement:\\nTemporal lobe involvement is also specific for MS. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the WMLs mostly found in the frontal and parietal lobes, uncommonly in the occipital lobes and not\\n in the temporal lobes. Only in CADASIL there is early involvement of the temporal lobes. T1WI: enhancing lesions on baseline scan and new enhancing lesions on follow up 3 months la\\nter..\\nEnhancement:\\nEnhancement is another typical finding in MS. These are images of a patient who was re-examined 3 months after the first clinical attack. Typical findings for MS as seen in this cas\\ne are: The edema around a new lesion will regress and finally only the center will remain as a hyperintense lesion on T2WI. The image shows a specimen with the perivenular inflammat\\nion in MS. MS starts as inflammation around these veins. In the first four weeks of the inflammation there is enhancement with gadolinium due to local interruption of the blood brai\\nn barrier. First there is homogeneous enhancement but this can change to (open) ring enhancement. Tumefactive MS. Arrow indicates biopsy site.\\nTumefactive MS:\\nTumefactive MS is a variant of Multiple Sclerosis. \\nOn MRI it presents as a large intra-parenchymal lesion with usually less mass effect than would be expected for its size.\\nThey may show some peripheral enhancement, often with an incomplete ring unlike gliomas or intraparenchymal abscesses, which typically have a closed-ring enhancement. These T2W and \\nT1W post-gadolinium images are of a 39-year-old male who presented with subacute onset of hemianopsia.\\nHe was referred for biopsy to differentiate between a glioma or demyelination. There is an intraparenchymal mass in the right temporal and occital lobe with a hypointense rim on T2,\\n which only partially enhances (open-ring sign) on the postcontrast images.\\nThere is surrounding edema, but relatively little mass effect. This was a biopsy-proven demyelinating lesion.\\nThe open-ring enhancement pattern with low signal T2 ring and low CBF are all indicative of demyelination.\\nSpinal cord lesions:\\nTypical spinal cord lesions in MS are relatively small and peripherally located.\\nThey are most often found in the cervical cord and are usually less than 2 vertebral segments in length.\\nA spinal cord lesion together with a lesion in the cerebellum or brainstem is very suggestive of MS. Spinal cord lesions are uncommon in most other CNS diseases, with the exception \\nof ADEM, sarcoid, and NMOSD. Proton-density-image of the spinal cord in a patient with MS The images show multiple short-segment lesions in the spinal cord. On PDW-images the spinal\\n cord has a uniformly low signal intensity (like CSF), which gives the MS lesions a good contrast against the surrounding CSF and normal cord tissue. Use a 512 matrix and cardiac ga\\nting for optimal results.\\nA good alternative for PDW is STIR.\\nMake sure to have two different sequences or two different planes.\\nMS Differential diagnosis:\\nThe differential diagnosis of MS is extremely large and includes almost all white matter diseases.\\nA broader differential diagnosis of white matter diseases is given here. In this chapter we will only deal with a limited number and there are some rules that we can follow. If a pa\\ntient is clinically suspected of having MS and the MR-images support that diagnosis, then you should not consider other uncommon diseases. Conversely, it is not wise to put MS in th\\ne differential diagnosis if the clinician does not suspect the patient of having MS and on the MR incidental WMLs are found.\\nThe odds are against the diagnosis of MS, because vascular WMLs are 50-500 times more likely than MS plaques. On the other hand if a patient is clinically suspected of having MS and\\n multiple WMLs are found, our major concern is the differential diagnosis MS versus small vessel disease. Then the McDonald criteria are very helpful.\\nPrevalence and a priori chance:\\nWhen we look at the prevalence of the white matter diseases, you will notice that there are enormous differences. Hereditary diseases are extremely uncommon as individual diseases, \\nbut as a group they are not that uncommon, but still far more uncommon than MS. CNS involvement in Lyme disease is extremely rare. When incidental WMLs are found, these are usually \\nthe result of small vessel disease, since up to 50% of patients that get an MR examination for whatever reason, will have WMLs of vascular origin. They are more common in older peop\\nle and in patients with vascular risk factors like atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, amyloid angiopathy, hyperhomocysteinemia, atrial fibrillation et\\nc. * Temporal lobe involvement is seen in CADASIL\\nSmall vessel disease:\\nThe differences between small vessel disease and MS are summarized in the table. Typical for MS is involvement of corpus callosum, U-fibers, temporal lobes, brainstem, cerebellum an\\nd spinal cord.\\nThis pattern of involvement is uncommon in other diseases.

This is a monophasic, immune-mediated demyelinating disease which often presents in ch\\nildren following an infection or vaccination. \\nMany of the patients have MOG antibodies (MOG= Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein). On MRI there are often diffuse and relatively symmetrical lesions in the supra-and infratentoria\\nl white matter which may enhance simultaneously.

A relatively rare but serious side effe\\nct of this drug is a higher risk of developing PML. The diagnosis of PML according to diagnostic criteria is based on the clinical presentation, the identification of JCV DNA in the\\n CNS (e.g., in the cerebrospinal fluid) and imaging findings preferably on MRI. Compared to other PML populations such as HIV, the imaging findings in natalizumab-associated PML hav\\ne been described as heterogeneous and fluctuating.

The most common causes are inflammato\\nry and demyelinating disorders like Multiple Sclerosis, Neuromyelitis Optica, Acute Disseminating Encephalomyelitis and Transverse myelitis. We will discuss the differential diagnos\\nis including tumors, inflammatory and vascular disorders.\\nIntroduction:\\nSpinal cord abnormalities. Common causes in white and uncommon causes in yellow.\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\nThe first question is usually  is it MS? \\nDoes it look like spinal cord MS and does the brain look like MS. If the patient has myelopathy and optic neuritis then also think of the possibility of Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) a\\nnd do the NMO-IgG test. If both halves of the cord are involved than think of Transverse Myelitis (TM) which is not a specific diagnosis, but merely a reaction of the cord to variou\\ns autoimmune and infectious stimuli.\\n2. Tumor The major differential of demyelinating diseases is an astrocytoma, especially if there is swelling and some enhancement of the cord and when the symptoms are more slowly p\\nrogressive. The other common spinal cord tumors like ependymoma and hemangioblastoma do not cause differential diagnostic problems, because in most cases they just look like a tumor\\n. Metastases to the cord are very uncommon.\\n3. Vascular Acute ischemia is typically seen as a complication of aortic aneurysm surgery or catheterisation. Cord ischemia due to venous hypertension or arterial steal can be seen \\nin vascular malformations like AV-fistula. So always look for abnormal vessels around the cord.\\n4. Infammatory Vasculitis\\n5. Infection Infection rarely involves the spinal cord. If we exclude myelopathy due to cord compression as seen in trauma, degeneration and metastatic disease, which is usually not\\n a diagnostic dilemma, then the most common diseases of the spinal cord are demyelinating diseases. MS is by far the most common demyelinating disease. The diagnosis can only be mad\\ne if there is dissemination over time and space. Many patients who are diagnosed as having acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) or Transverse Myelitis, may have recurrent di\\nsease and later turn out to have MS (red arrow).\\nSystematic approach:\\nWhenever there is an abnormality in the spinal cord, we need a systematic approach to analyse the findings. Clinical findings can be helpful but can be quite similar in most spinal \\ncord disorders. On MR look for the following: In MS there is typically a short segment involved, i.e. less than 2 segments. In other diseases like Transverse Myelitis, NMO and ische\\nmia there is usually a long segment involved.\\n* How much of the cord is involved on tranverse images?\\nPartial involvement is typically seen in MS.\\nComplete involvement includes both halves of the cord and is typically seen in TM and NMO.\\n* Location of the involvement on transverse images?\\nUse high resolution transverse images to detect the location within the cord. Is it posterior like in MS, vitamin B12 deficiensy, lateral like in MS or anterior like in arterial inf\\narction.\\n* Is the cord swollen? In TM and tumor the cord is swollen, while in MS and ADEM the cord is not swollen or less swollen then you would expect for the size of the lesion.\\n* Is there enhancement?\\nMany diseases show some enhancement, but the most important thing is that astrocytoma has to be included in the differential diagnosis.\\nShort or long segment involvement:\\nTransverse involvement:\\nTransverse images are very helpful in the differential diagnosis. You need high resolution images. Look for how much is involved (both halves or not), which part is involved and wha\\nt is the form of the involvement. Brain abnormalities In many cases of myelopathy there will also be brain abnormalities and these can be a diagnostic clue to the diagnosis.\\nMultiple Sclerosis:\\nMS: short segment focal wedge-shaped involvement of the posterior column of the spinal cord with typical periventricular WM-lesions. key facts: MS is the most common demyelinating d\\nisease and there is overlap between these diseases. NMO was first thought to be a form of MS, but is now considered to be a distinct form. ADEM can relapse and progress to MS. The p\\nartial form of transverse myelitis Here we have images of a typical case. Many times the clinical history is very helpful like in this case. This 24-year old patient had visual dist\\nurbances on one eye followed by weakness and sensory disturbances of the lower and upper extremities a couple of years later. Now she presents with sensory disturbances of both lowe\\nr extremities. So we already think MS. In the cord there are some well-defined lesions, but also some ill-defined foggy lesions. The transverse image shows the dorsal location and t\\nhe typical triangular shape. Continue with the contrast-enhanced images On the contrast-enhanced images there is no enhancement. Active MS-lesions in the spine may enhance, but it i\\ns not that common as we see in active lesions in the brain. Whenever spinal lesions are encountered, it can be helpful to image the brain aswell. Now sometimes the patient is only s\\nceduled for MRI of the spine and you don't have time to do a full brain examinations. In those cases consider to do only a sagittal FLAIR. Continue with the images of the brain. The\\n MRI of the brain shows periventricular lesions and a lesion in the corpus callosum. These locations are very specific for MS. MS with non-specific findings in the spinal cord. In a\\nnother patient there are non-specific lesions in the cord. Based on the examination of the spine alone, we have a broad differential diagnosis. However when we examine the brain, it\\n becomes obvious that we are dealing with MS. Continue with the images of the brain. Typical MS in the brain In this case the findings in the brain are very helpful. The location of\\n the lesions is very typical: pons, periventricular and subcortical. MS Now what can we expect in the spinal cord of patients with MS. It is like in the brain. Frequently the lesion\\ns are focal like we see on the left image. Less commonly there are diffuse abnormalities and then we have a tough differential diagnosis which will include TM and NMO. In long stand\\ning cases atrophy will be seen. One third of MS patients will have spinal symptoms. One third of patients have isolated spinal MS without any findings in the brain. However patholog\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 118}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"ic studies have shown that 95% of MS patients have spinal cord lesions, whether they have spinal symptoms or not. MS in the cord On transverse images MS lesions typically have a rou\\nnd or triangular shape and are located posteriorly or laterally. So can we exclude MS if a lesion is located anteriorly? Unfortunately not. MS is the great mimicker and can also be \\nlocated anteriorly like in this patient who has a lesion in the typical location (blue arrow) but also a lesion ventrally in the cord (red arrow). This is uncommon, but you can not \\nexclude MS. When MS lesions are active, they can enhance, but enhancement is not as common as in the brain. The enhancement patterns are non-specific. You can see ring enhancement, \\nintense and less-intense enhancement. The less intense or vague enhancement is the most common pattern. Acute exacerbation of cerebral and spinal MS These are images of a patient wi\\nth longstanding MS and acute exacerbation. There is enhancement in the active lesions. Continue with the images of the cervical spine. Acute exacerbation of cerebral and spinal MS A\\nlso in the spinal cord there are multiple lesions. On the transverse image a typical triangular shaped dorsal lesion is seen. Continue with the contrast-enhanced images. Acute exace\\nrbation of cerebral and spinal MS Also in the spine there are multiple enhancing MS-lesions. Diffuse abnormalities in MS. Courtesy of Sundgren Pia, Lund, SE MS usually presents with\\n focal abnormalities. Diffuse abnormalities that can look like transverse myelitis or extensive astrocytoma are sometimes seen. This pattern is more common in primary progressive an\\nd secondary progressive MS. Atrophy in longstanding MS Some say that spinal cord atrophy is specific for primary progressive MS (PPMS). The atrophy correlates very well with the cli\\nnical disability. It is more prominent in the upper part of the spinal cord. Duration of the disease is the most important determinant of cord atrophy.\\nNeuromyelitis Optica:\\nNMO presenting with neuritis optica (arrows). The brain is normal.Courtesy Andrea Rossi key facts: On the left images of a child who presented with unilateral neuritis optica. Image\\ns of the brain were otherwise normal. Continue with MRI of the spine. Patients who have one episode of optic neuritis or myelitis and who test positive for NMO-IgG are at high risk \\nfor developing the full spectrum of NMO. One month later this child presented with acute transverse myelopathy, i.e. bilateral symptoms. The images show abnormal signal in the spina\\nl cord with swelling and some enhancement. An astrocytoma could very well present with these images, but given the history of an optic neuritis and the acute myelopathy, we do not t\\nhink of a tumor. This proved to be NMO and the Ig-test for NMO was positive. In the original description of Devic's disease the optic neuritis and the myelopathy were simultaneously\\n, but now we know that this is not always the case. Periventricular lesions in NMO around fourth and third ventricle. Brain lesions in NMO Previously it was thought that in NMO the \\nbrain was spared, but now we know, that brain lesions do occur. They are often distinct from those seen in MS. In Asia 60-80% of patients with NMO have brain abnormalities. In Europ\\ne only 25-40%. The location of the brain lesions in NMO is only around the ventricles. Periventricular lesions in NMO around third and lateral ventricles. The reason why these brain\\n lesions are located around the ventricles is the following: The NMO IgG auto-antibodies are directed against Aquaporin-4 water-channels. So just like sodium- and potassium channels\\n in the cells, there are also water-channels. The highest concentration of these Aquaporin-4 water-channels is seen around the ventricles. The images show abnormal signal around the\\n third and frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Neuromyelitis optica with callosal lesions. Courtesy Dr Nakamura. Things become even more complicated, since it is also possible \\nto have large lesions in the corpus callosum of patients with NMO as was described by Nakamura (6). So in any CNS disease with optic nerve and spinal cord involvement it is goos to \\ndo the test for NMO-IgG.\\nADEM:\\nADEM key facts: On the left images of a teenage child with a typical history: Eye movement disturbance and impairment in consciousness. This clinical history is typical for ADEM. Us\\nually the brain is also involved. 30% of cases has spinal involvement. The imaging findings in this case are also typical. There is swelling and cord involvement like in TM and no e\\nnhancement. Continue with the images of the brain. ADEM First look at the images of the brain and decide what is different from MS-lesions. What is typical for ADEM and uncommon for\\n MS is: ADEM - follow up The follow up MR shows that the cord has returned to normal again. On the left another case of ADEM. ADEM is typically seen in children. Again there is diff\\nuse involvement of the spinal cord without enhancement and there is involvement of the brain. Typical ADEM. Courtesy of Andrea Rossi, Genova, IT Another case of ADEM. Notice the typ\\nical involvement of the pons and basal ganglia. Continue with follow up scan. Courtesy of Andrea Rossi, Genova, IT On follow up scan almost complete normalisation.\\nTransverse Myelitis (TM):\\nkey facts: The sagittal image shows a large segment of hyperintensity on T2WI. The transverse image shows that most of the cord is involved. ATM on T2WI, CE-T1WI and STIR. These ima\\nges are of a 31 year old male with headache, voiding disturbances, urinary retention, sensory level C3. The CSF analysis revealed 400/3 cells (meaning no infection) and a slightly h\\nigher protein level. The images show a long segment myelopathy with full transverse involvement. There is no swelling and no enhancement. It does not look like MS or tumor, so we ar\\ne thinking ATM - acute transverse myelitis.\\nDiseases associated with Transverse Myelitis:\\nTransverse myelitis may occur in isolation or in the setting of another illness. When it occurs without apparent underlying cause, it is referred to as idiopathic. Idiopathic transv\\nerse myelitis is assumed to be the result of abnormal activation of the immune system against the spinal cord. The table provides a list of illnesses associated with TM (7). Patient\\ns with an acute short segment TM (or APTM) are at risk of developing MS if there is one of the following: In children with TM the expression is usually more severe. 60-90% are unabl\\ne to move their legs.\\nHowever the outcome is usually better than in adults and in 30-50% there is complete recovery. Typical for TM is that on the initial MR the abnormalities are usually extensive and l\\ness or completely resolved on follow up scans. Longitudinal case series of TM reveal that approximately 1/3 of patients recover with little to no sequelae, 1/3 are left with moderat\\ne degree of permanent disability, and 1/3 have severe disabilities. Here images of a typical case of TM. There is multisegment high signal on STIR and T2WI with some swelling. Most \\nof the cord in the transverse diameter is involved. There is no enhancement, which is usually the case in TM. Sometimes there is some patchy enhancement. Astrocytoma simulating Tran\\nsverse myelitis When there is enhancement, it can be difficult to differentiate TM from an astrocytoma. On the left images of a 60 year old male with an astrocytoma. He presented wi\\nth pain in the thoracic region and sensory disturbances in the left lower extremity followed by left hemiparesis. There is multisegment high signal on T2WI with some swelling, just \\nlike we have seen in cases of TM. On CE-T1WI there is a region of enhancement. The region of enhancement is more tumor-like, but the differentiation is difficult.\\nSpinal cord tumor:\\nSpinal astrocytoma\\nAstrocytoma:\\nAs we have just seen, the major differential of the spinal cord diseases that we have discussed so far is an astrocytoma. Astrocytoma is a diffusely infiltrating tumor, that is not \\nmass-like. Usually there is some patchy enhancement. On the left an astrocytoma in a 66 year old patient who presented with progressive sensory complaints. Biopsy revealed astrocyto\\nma. Continue with the follow up. Spinal astrocytoma - follow up The patient was not operable and a follow up scan shows progressive disease. Multiple ependymomas The other two commo\\nn spinal cord tumors are ependymoma and hemangioblastoma and they just look like a tumor. They present as enhancing masses and will not cause a differential problem. All other cord \\ntumors are uncommon. The images are of a patient with neurofibromatosis who has multiple ependymomas. They present as multiple enhancing masses.\\nVascular:\\nArterial infarction:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Spinal cord ischemia is typically seen as a complication of aortic aneurysm surgery or stenting. The images are of a patient who developed a paraparesis after stenting of an aortic \\naneurysm. Notice the high signal ventrally in the chord, which is typical for arterial infarction. On transverse images a typical snake-eye appearance can be seen. DWI in spinal cho\\nrd ischemia Aortic aneurysm stenting is the most common cause of spinal chord infarction. The diffusion images show restricted diffusion.\\nVasculitis:\\nThe images are of a child with headache, fever, hyperalgesia and numbness of the left side of the body. There is also abducens nerve palsy. The images are non-specific with multiple\\n focal lesions and probably the first choise would be MS. The differential diagnosis would include inflammation, infection and metastases. In such cases always perform a transverse \\nimage of the spine to look for the exact location and perform a MRI of the brain. Continue. The lesions are located dorsally and one of the lesions is enhancing. Now if this was inf\\nection or metastases it would be strange that not all lesions enhance. MS is still on our list. Continue with the MR of the brain. Idiopathic Vasculitis On the CE-T1WI only one lesi\\non shows enhancement. The location of the lesions and the enhancement could very well fit to the diagnosis of MS, but this proved to be vasculitis. Vasculitis can be idiopathic, but\\n is also seen in SLE, Sj?gren and Behcet. Normally you think of vasculitis as a disease of the vessels in the brain, but all vasculitis can be seen in the spine as well. It produces\\n MS-like images.\\nSpinal AVF:\\nThe most common vascular malformation of the spinal cord is the dural AV-fistula. It consist of an abnormal connection between the artery and the veins , which can lead to increased\\n venous pressure and predisposes the cord to ischemia and less commonly to hemorrhage. AVF's are mostly seen in the elderly population and are believed to be the result of trauma. A\\nn accurate diagnosis is important because these lesions may represent a reversible cause of myelopathy. Notice the high signal in the lower thoracic cord and the surrounding dilated\\n vessels on the T2WI. On the enhanced T1WI there is subtle enhancement. Another case with myelopathy and dilated veins as a result of an AVF. Another patient with myelopathy and dil\\nated vessels surrounding the cord. Notice the hypointense areas on the T2WI which represents hemorrhage. Another AVF with myelopathy and dilated vessels.\\nCord compression:\\nAlthough beyond the scope of this article, the most common cause of myelopathy is cord compression as seen in trauma, metastatic disease and epidural hemorrhage. This patient has a \\nfracture with posterior displacement. There is myelopathy due to traumatic cord compression. Another case of cord compression in a patient who was treated with anticoagulantia. Ther\\ne is myelopathy as a result of compression by a dorsally located epidural hemorrhage. The most common cause of cord compression is metastatic disease. Notice the abnormal signal in \\nthe vertebral body as a result of a metastasis which extends into the vertebral canal. by Andrea Rossi Neuroimaging Clinics of North America, Volume 18, Issue 1, Pages 149-161\\n3.

We will discuss: by Leonard M.\\n Glassman\\nNormal Male Mammogram:\\nNormal male mammogram Click on image to enlarge When you do breast imaging in a male, always stick to the following rule:\\n 'If it is not normal, gynecomastia or classically benign,\\n it needs a biopsy'. So, first we're going to give you a couple of examples of the normal male breast, just to get used to what normal looks like. Then we will discuss gynecomastia \\nand finally discuss some specific tumors. Obviously, the lesions in this last category will need a biopsy, unless you are sure that it is classically benign, like for instance a lym\\nph node or lipoma. On the left two examples of a normal male mammogram. The left image shows normal skin, a nipple and a small amount of connective tissue behind the nipple. The ima\\nge on the right shows a bit more connective tissue, but this is still normal. Normal male mammogram On the left another normal male breast. There is more fatty tissue and there are \\na number of blood vessels. There is a small amount of fibrous connective tissue, but basically most of this breast is just fat. MR of the male breast T1WI with fat suppression On th\\ne left a MRI of the normal male breast. There is a small amount of connective tissue behind the nipple.\\nGynecomastia:\\nGynecomastia Gynecomastia is the most common abnormality in the male breast. Clinically, it presents as a soft mobile tender subareolar mass. Every word in this sentence is critical\\n: \\nsoft - mobile - tender - subareolar . So it has to be soft and mobile. It is tender in the acute phase, but not in the chronic phase. Gynecomastia must be subareolar! Any mass that \\nis not subareolar is not gynecomastia. Gynecomastia: nodular glandular pattern.Notice how it blends into the surrounding fat. Imaging pattern There are three imaging patterns: On th\\ne left a male breast with a nodular glandular pattern of gynecomastia. There is a fan shaped density radiating from the nipple. It may be more prominent in the upper outer quadrant \\nand, more importantly, it blends into the surrounding fat. If you think about the mammogram on the left as the breast of a woman instead of a man, than you might say that there is a\\nn ill-defined mass and you might conclude that this is a malignancy . However, in a man this indistinct border is a sign of a gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is simultaneous proliferatio\\nn of ducts and stroma without encapsulation, so it must blend into the surrounding fat tissue. There is no proliferation of lobuli, like there is in women. So you will not see tumor\\ns that start in the lobuli, for example lactating adenomas, fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumors, and also invasive lobular carcinomas are extremely rare. Left: gynecomastia in a young m\\naleRight: Juvenile hypertrophy in an 8 year old female On the far left a mammogram of a male with gynecomastia and next to it a mammogram of an eight year old girl with juvenile hyp\\nertrophy. Notice that they look very much the same. Gynecomastia nodular pattern: Incidental finding on CT-scan On the left unilateral gynecomastia. This was an incidental finding o\\nn a CT-scan done for some other reason. By definition gynecomastia is 2 cm or more of subareolar tissue in a non obese male. It is a common 'normal' finding, that is seen in 55% of \\nmen at autopsy. The peak incidence is 60 - 69 years. It is significant if it is new or symptomatic. In elderly males gynecomastia makes up 65% of all breast lesions. 25% is carcinom\\na and 10% are other lesions.

              " Document(page_content=\"The nodular pattern of gynecomastia is seen in the florid early phase. It begins as an increased number of ducts and epithelial proliferation with edema and cellular fibroblastic st\\nroma. This phase is reversible. On the left a mammogram and an ultrasound image of a patient with a nodular glandular pattern of gynecomastia. Notice that it is situated underneath \\nthe nipple. The ultrasound image shows the typical appearance of gynecomastia: a hypoechoic mass with lobulation or even spiculation. If this was seen in a woman, you would say that\\n this is a mass with microlobulation and spiculation, i.e. Birads IV or V. In a man this is typical for gynecomastia. On the left the same ultrasound image, but now in the normal po\\nsition. Notice how 'malignant' it looks. Gynecomastia nodular pattern: T2W-fatsat and T1WI+Gd On the left a T2W-image with fatsat and a T1W-image after Gadolinium with fatsat. A rad\\niologist who was not used to looking at 'male' mammograms ordered the MR for problem solving. Obviously this MR was performed for the wrong reason. MR should not be used to solve a \\nproblem that can be solved with mammography. Anyhow the MR shows gynecomastia of the nodular pattern. Dendritic pattern of gynecomastia\\nDendritic Pattern:\\nThe dendritic pattern is seen in the fibrotic or late phase. There are dilated ducts, moderate epithelial proliferation and fibrosis. On the left a mammogram showing a subareolar de\\nnsity with prominent extensions into the fat. Usually the density is smaller than in the nodular pattern. Classic benign chronic gynecomastia On the mammogram on the left we can ima\\ngine, that there is fibrosis with extension into the fat. This is different from the glandular edema-like appearance in the acute phase of gynecomastia. The ultrasound shows a spicu\\nlated appearance. These cases clearly demonstrate that gynecomastia can have an appearance which we would call malignant in a woman. Unfortunately some of the malignant lesions in a\\n man can look benign and we will show some examples in the next chapter.\\nDiffuse glandular pattern:\\nThis pattern is seen in males with very high estrogen levels. The images on the left simply look like small female breasts. This was a patient who was on estrogen therapy for prosta\\nte carcinoma. Pseudogynecomastia\\nPseudogynecomastia:\\nThis is usually bilateral and there is no palpable mass. Remember that gynecomastia presents clinically as a soft, mobile, tender, subareolar mass. Pseudogynecomastia results from e\\nxcessive fat deposition in the breast area. It is seen as a normal variant, in obesity and in neurofibromatosis.\\nBenign Lesions:\\nLet's first start with a list of lesions that should not be diagnosed in male patients, because they simply do not get these lesions. A man does not get a lactating adenoma, because\\n it is only seen in pregnancy. Because there are very few lobules in a man, lobular tumors are extremely rare. There are only a few invasive lobular carcinomas reported in men. Fibr\\noepithelial lesions are also extremely rare because they too start in the lobules. So do not diagnose a fibroadenoma in a man, even if it looks like a fibroadenoma. When you get a b\\niopsy result that says fibroadenoma, get another pathologist. On the left lesions that do occur in males. Exept for gynecomastia and pseudogynecomastia, in most of these lesions we \\nwill not get a diagnosis from imaging. We just report that there is a Birads IV lesion and do a biopsy. Myofibroblastoma\\nMyofibroblastoma:\\nMyofibroblastoma is an interesting lesion because it is the only one lesion that is more common in men than in women. It presents as a freely moveable, solitary, palpable, firm mass\\n. There are no calcifications. The mean age is in the late 50's. On the left a large lesion, that looks like a fibroadenoma. Now we know that men do not get fibroadenomas. The patho\\nlogy diagnosis was myofibroblastoma and the lesion was treated with local excision. Myofibroblastoma eccentric to the nipple in a patient with a little bit of gynecomastia bilateral\\nly On the left another myofibroblastoma. It presents as a circumscribed lobulated mass without calcification.\\nNotice that the lesion is eccentric to the nipple.\\nIt is the lobulated mass that needs to be biopsied, not the retromamillary gynecomastia. Myofibroblastoma eccentric to the nipple On the left another myofibroblastoma. The nipple is\\n marked and the lesion is not retromamillary. On the ultrasound image the lesion is difficult to differentiate from the surrounding fat. Myofibroblastoma presenting as a circumscrib\\ned lobulated mass without calcification On the left another myofibroblastoma. Even if this lesion was located behind the nipple, you would not diagnose this as gynecomastia, because\\n it is a lobulated mass. Granular Cell Tumor\\nGranular Cell Tumor:\\nThis is a benign tumor of neural origin. They occur anywhere in the body. 6% occur in the breasts. They are typically seen in men in their 30's. Usually they present as circumscribe\\nd in males, but sometimes they have a spiculated appearance. Notice that the lesion on the left has a indistinct border as is usually seen in gynecomastia, but on the mammogram it i\\ns not located directly under the skin. So this is not gynecomastia and a biopsy is necessary. Granular Cell Tumor On the left another Granular cell tumor. Epidermal inclusion cyst\\nEpidermal inclusion cyst:\\nEpidermal inclusion cyst is a skin lesion.\\nIt presents as a round well circumscribed dense mass. On the left a small epidermal inclusion cyst.\\nNotice how it raises the skin. Epidermal inclusion cyst On the left a large epidermal inclusion cyst. Epidermal inclusion cyst. T2WI with fat sat and pathology On the left a T2W ima\\nge demonstrating the cystic nature and the pathology specimen. Granulomatous Mastitis\\nGranulomatous Mastitis:\\nMost are idiopathic. Specific causes must be excluded like TB, Sarcoid and fat necrosis. On the left is a male breast that looks like the breast of a female. These lesions can somet\\nimes be spiculated. Varix\\nVarix:\\nOn the left a lesion that looks like a cyst, but remember that cysts originate in the lobules and men do not have lobules, unless they take estrogen. This is a varix and if you punc\\nture it, you get a big red surprise. Leiomyoma\\nLeiomyoma:\\nOn the left a lesion, that looks like a fibroadenoma, but men do not get fibroadenomas. It is a solid encapsulated mass and at biopsy it happened to be a leiomyoma. If there are mor\\ne than 2 mitoses per high power field the pathologist calls it a leiomyosarcoma.\\nMale Breast Cancer:\\nInvasive ductal carcinoma Malignant disease in men just looks like malignant disease in women. In the USA there are about 1700 new cases each year, which is 1% of all breast cancer.\\n There is a higher incidence in people from China and Africa due to hyperestrogenism secondary to parasitic liver disease. These cancers present as a unilateral painless subareolar \\nmass. This subareolar location is just like in gynecomastia, but usually it is eccentric to the nipple. It sometimes presents with bloody nipple discharge, which is unlike gynecomas\\ntia. Usually it is invasive ductal cancer. As stated above invasive lobular cancer is extremely rare. Also DCIS is rare because there is no screening program for men, so they will p\\nresent when there is a palpable mass. On the left an eccentric irregular mass with spiculae. If this was a women you would have no trouble in diagnosing this as a cancer.\\nIn a man it is the same. Invasive ductal carcinoma Male breast cancer presents as a round, oval or irregular mass. Calcifications are rare, but when they occur they are coarser than\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n",

It is usually of water-density and is not typically fatty. On the CT on the left you can see the den\\nsity of the lesion that proved to be a liposarcoma.\\nConclusion:\\nGynecomastia versus Carcinoma:\\nIn conclusion we can say, that male breast disease either presents as mass, pain or nipple discharge. Gynecomastia and invasive ductal cancer are the most common lesions in the male\\n breast, but there are other rarer benign and malignant lesions. Gynecomastia and carcinoma can usually be differentiated, but biopsy is sometimes necessary to separate them. All le\\nsions eccentric to the nipple need biopsy unless they are characteristically benign, i.e.contain fat or typical lymph node. On the left a list of characteristics of gynecomastia ver\\nsus carcinoma. Notice that there are many similarities. Both gynecomastia and carcinoma occur mostly at the age of 60 and can be soft, mobile, subareolar and unilateral. So that doe\\ns not help. Carcinoma is usually eccentric, while gynecomastia is never eccentric. Gynecomastia has to have extensions into the surroundig fat. Carcinoma sometimes may have spiculat\\nions, that can look the same. Actually we call it extension into the fat, if we think it is gynecomastia and spiculation, if we think it is a carcinoma. On the left two cases, that \\ndemonstrate, that it can be difficult to differentiate gynecomastia from carcinoma on a mammogram. The carcinoma on the right is a little bit more encapsulated than the gynecomastia\\n on the right. In less than 10% of the cases a biopsy can be needed to make the differentiation. On the left two more cases. On the far left there is diffuse gynecomastia. On the ri\\nght a huge cancer which is encapsulated. The last cases on the left look very similar to each other. Based on the mammogram these two can not be differentiated. In those rare instan\\nces a biopsy is needed.\\nNone:\\nCrohn's disease - role of MRI:\\nCarl Puylaert, Jeroen Tielbeek and Jaap Stoker\\nthe Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2016-02-17 In this article we will discuss the MRI-features used to evaluate Crohn's disease of the small bowel and the colon. A systematic approach is presented to \\ngrade disease activity resulting in a simple classification of mild, moderate and severe disease. This is sufficient for most therapeutic decisions.\\nIntroduction:\\nCrohn's disease is characterized by inflammatory lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly in the terminal ileum and colon. The lesions are usually transmural, which can \\nlead to complications like stenoses, fistulas and abscesses. While most patients first present with inflammation only, about two thirds of patients will develop complications within\\n 10 years (1). There is no cure for Crohn's disease. Immunosuppressive drugs can decrease disease activity, maintain remission and prevent relapse. Eventually 90% of patients with i\\nleocolic disease require surgery (2).\\nMRI protocol:\\nBowel distention There are two techniques to acquire distension of the small bowel: We routinely perform MR enterography as it suffices in the large majority of patients while being\\n less burdensome and more time efficient. Oral contrastFor oral contrast several options are available. We use a Mannitol in water solution (2%), which provides good contrast betwee\\nn lumen and bowel wall on both T1 and T2 sequences and is well accepted by patients. There is one precaution: no colonoscopy with electrocoagulation should be performed directly aft\\ner the MRI because of methane resulting from Mannitol breakdown. MRI sequences We use the following sequences: Optional sequences:\\nGrading Crohn's disease activity:\\nClick for enlarged view There are several systems for grading disease activity in Crohn's disease. The scoring system, that we use, grades disease activity into none, mild, moderate\\n and severe. It is based on the score of the bowel wall abnormalities and the presence of complications as presented in the table (3). Additional findings Other findings that should\\n be mentioned in the radiology report are:\\nMRI signs of Crohn's disease:\\nBowel wall thickening with deep ulceration (arrow) in the transverse colon.\\nBowel wall thickness:\\nWith adequate distension the normal bowel wall has a thickness of 1-3 mm. A common categorization is 3-5 mm for mild thickening, 5-7 mm for moderate thickening and > 7 mm for marked\\n thickening of the bowel wall. T1 weighted post-contrast images or non fatsat T2 weighted images (if available) are preferable for measurement of bowel wall thickness. The image is \\na coronal post-contrast T1 weighted image showing disease activity in the transverse colon with marked wall thickening of more than 7 mm and deep ulceration (arrow). Balanced FFE im\\nage shows marked bowel wall thickening and luminal narrowing of the terminal ileum. Measurement on the balanced FFE sequence can be less accurate due to the black border artifact (a\\nrrows). Increased bowel wall thickness is one of the most common signs of inflammatory activity, but not specific for Crohn's disease. For more information on the differential diagn\\nosis of bowel wall thickening click here. Bowel wall thickness correlates well with the severity of the disease activity. Measurements are best performed on the sequence with good l\\numinal distension. Black border artifacts on balanced FFE sequences can distort thickness measurements. Thickened terminal ileum segment with marked enhancement on axial post-contra\\nst T1W image with fatsat.\\nEnhancement:\\nAbnormal bowel wall enhancement after administration of gadolinium is the result of increased vascular permeability and angiogenesis. It is seen both in active disease and fibrosis.\\n Enhancement can be graded by comparing to the precontrast images, to normal bowel loops and nearby vascular structures. Pattern of enhancement Enhancement of the bowel wall can be \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 122}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='categorized in one of the following patterns: The latter two enhancement patterns can only be appreciated when the wall is thickened. There is some discussion about the value of the\\n enhancement pattern. A layered pattern is regarded to depict more severe disease activity compared to the mucosal pattern, which in turn is more severe than a homogeneous pattern (\\n4). However, different degrees of inflammation and fibrosis can be present at the same time and a layered pattern of enhancement has also been associated with fibrosis (5), although\\n a more recent study did not find this association (6). Homogeneous enhancementStrong homogeneous enhancement is seen in active inflammation. The image shows a terminal ileum with a\\n homogeneous enhancement pattern with moderate (green arrow) and marked (red arrow) enhancement on an axial post-contrast T1 image. Mucosal enhancement pattern Mucosal enhancement T\\nhis is seen as bowel wall thickening with increased enhancement of the mucosal layer relative to the outer layers. The image is a post-contrast T1 image with a mucosal enhancement p\\nattern in the terminal ileum (arrow). There is relatively low enhancement of the middle and outer layers Layered enhancement pattern of the rectum with some surrounding fat strandin\\ng on an axial post-contrast T1 image (arrow). Continued inflammation with a homogeneous enhancement pattern can be seen in the sigmoid colon (green arrow). Also, a right-sided adnex\\nal cyst is present with enhancing rim (arrowheads). Layered enhancement\\npattern This pattern suggests severe disease activity or longstanding chronic disease (4,5). The three-layered appearance is caused by strong enhancement of the mucosa and the seros\\na with no enhancement of the middle layer, which is the submucosa and the muscular layer. This middle layer can consist of fat, edema or fibrotic tissue. This can be distinguished u\\nsing a fat sat T2 sequence. Actively inflamed terminal ileum with marked thickening and moderate mural signal intensity (mural edema) on an axial T2 with fat sat.\\nT2 mural signal intensity:\\nIncreased mural signal intensity on fat-saturated T2 images indicates the presence of mural edema, suggesting active disease. Presence of bowel wall thickening with a low mural T2 s\\nignal intensity is more suggestive of fibrotic disease. The psoas muscle can be used as a reference when assessing mural T2 signal. Fat suppression is routinely used to differentiat\\ne between mural fat depositions and mural edema. Fat depositions are the result of chronic bowel inflammation and therefore quite common in Crohn\\'s disease. However, its presence do\\nes not indicate active disease. Perimural edema or fluid can be identified as well and is associated with active disease (7). Inflamed small bowel showing wall thickening and mild m\\nural T2 signal (arrow) on an axial T2 with fat sat. Prestenotic dilatation can be seen proximally of the diseased segment. T2 mural signal intensity can be graded as follows using a\\n T2 sequence with fat sat: Wall thickening of the terminal ileum in a 67-year-old male with Crohn\\'s disease since 11 years. Layered enhancement is seen on an axial post-contrast T1 \\nimage with fat sat (left). T2 with fat sat (middle) shows the same pattern with a middle layer of low intensity. T2 without fat sat shows an increased signal in the middle layer, su\\nggesting fat depositions. Endoscopy showed only superficial disease. Fat suppression is routinely used to differentiate between mural fat depositions and mural edema. Fat deposition\\ns are a result of chronic bowel inflammation, but not typical of active disease. These fat depositions can be diffuse but can also present as a layered pattern. The CT equivalent fo\\nr this pattern is the \\'fat-halo sign\\'. Coronal post-contrast T1 and T2 fat sat images show multiple small ulcerations in the terminal ileum.\\nUlceration:\\nModerate to deep ulceration can be seen on T1 and T2 images, but small ulcerations can be difficult to distinguish from mucosal folds depending on the degree of luminal distension. \\nUlcerations are active spots of inflammation and usually there is increased enhancement on the post-contrast T1 images.\\nLoss of haustration:\\nWhen the colon is involved in Crohn\\'s disease a decrease of haustral folds can be seen. A complete loss of haustration results in a smooth surface. This is also a common finding in \\nulcerative colitis and known as \\'lead pipe\\' colon. The coronal post-contrast T1 image shows loss of haustral folds throughout the colon in a patient with chronic Crohn\\'s disease. Co\\nronal post-contrast T1 image shows marked enhancement of the terminal ileum with a prominent comb sign.\\nComb sign:\\nIncreased vascularity of the mesentery is seen in active inflammation.

No obvious pre-stenotic dilatation is seen. The stenosis was non-passable using endoscopy (right).\\nStenosis:\\nStenosis can present as bowel wall thickening combined with lumen narrowing. The presence of a prestenotic dilatation increases the likelihood of a stenosis. Abnormal contrast enhan\\ncement of the affected bowel segment is usually present. In the grading system, only severe stenosis is included as a complication, which is defined as a stenosis with prestenotic d\\nilatation and a moderate-to-marked increase in mural T2 signal.

Left ventricle (LV) failure is \\nthe most common and results in decreased cardiac output and increased pulmonary venous pressure. In the lungs LV failure will lead to dilatation of pulmonary vessels, leakage of flu\\nid into the interstitium and the pleural space and finally into the alveoli resulting in pulmonary edema. Right ventricle (RV) failure is usually the result of long standing LV fail\\nure or pulmonary disease and causes increased systemic venous pressure resulting in edema in dependent tissues and abdominal viscera. In the illustration on the left some of the fea\\ntures, that can be seen on a chest-film in a patient with CHF. Increased pulmonary venous pressure is related to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and can be graded into\\n stages, each with its own radiographic features on the chest film (Table). This grading system provides a logical sequence of signs in congestive heart failure. In daily clinical p\\nractice however some of these features are not seen in this sequence and sometimes may not be present at all. This can be seen in patients with chronic heart failure, mitral valve d\\nisease and in chronic obstructive lung disease.\\nCongestive Heart Failure:\\nViews of the upper lobe vessels of a patient in good condition (left) and during a period of CHF (right). Notice also the increased width of the vascular pedicle (red arrows).\\nStage I - Redistribution:\\nIn a normal chest film with the patient standing erect, the pulmonary vessels supplying the upper lung fields are smaller and fewer in number than those supplying the lung bases. Th\\ne pulmonary vascular bed has a significant reserve capacity and recruitment may open previously non-perfused vessels and causes distension of already perfused vessels. This results \\nin redistribution of pulmonary blood flow. First there is equalisation of blood flow and subsequently redistribution of flow from the lower to the upper lobes. The term redistributi\\non applies to chest x-rays taken in full inspiration in the erect position. In daily clinical practice many chest films are taken in a supine or semi-erect position and the gravitat\\nional difference between the apex and the lung bases will be less. In the supine position, there will be equalisation of blood flow, which may give the false impression of redistrib\\nution. In these cases comparison with old fims can be helpful. Increased artery-to-bronchus ratio in CHF Artery-to-bronchus ratio Normally the vessels in the upper lobes are smaller\\n than the accompanying bronchus with a ratio of 0.85 (3). At the level of the hilum they are equal and in the lower lobes the arteries are larger with a ratio of 1.35. When there is\\n redistribution of pulmonary blood flow there will be an increased artery-to-bronchus ratio in the upper and middle lobes. This is best visible in the perihilar region. On the left \\na patient with cardiomegaly and redistribution. The upper lobe vessels have a diameter > 3 mm (normal 1-2 mm). Notice the increased artery-to-bronchus ratio at hilar level (arrows).\\n LEFT: normal. RIGHT: CHF stage II with Kerley B-lines due to interstitial edema\\nStage II - Interstitial edema:\\nStage II of CHF is characterized by fluid leakage into the interlobular and peribronchial interstitium as a result of the increased pressure in the capillaries. When fluid leaks int\\no the peripheral interlobular septa it is seen as Kerley B or septal lines. Kerley-B lines are seen as peripheral short 1-2 cm horizontal lines near the costophrenic angles. These l\\nines run perpendicular to the pleura. Perihilar haze in interstitial stage of CHF When fluid leaks into the peribronchovascular interstitium it is seen as thickening of the bronchia\\nl walls (peribronchial cuffing) and as loss of definition of these vessels (perihilar haze). On the left a patient with congestive heart failure. There is an increase in the caliber\\n of the pulmonary vessels and they have lost their definition because they are surrounded by edema. Previous normal chest x-ray (left) and CHF stage II with perihilar haze (right) O\\nn the left another patient with congestive heart failure. The lateral view nicely demonstrates the increased diameter of the pulmonary vessels and the hazy contours. Notice also the\\n septal lines and the accentuated interstitium. Furthermore the fissura major is markedly thickened.

On the image on the left notice the following: In a patient with a known malignancy lymphangitic carcinomatosis would be high in the differential\\n diagnostic list. Ground glass opacity is the first presentation of alveolar edema and a precursor of consolidation. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nStage III - Alveolar edema:\\nThis stage is characterized by continued fluid leakage into the interstitium, which cannot be compensated by lymphatic drainage. This eventually leads to fluid leakage in the alveol\\ni (alveolar edema) and to leakage into the pleural space (pleural effusion). The distribution of the alveolar edema can be influenced by: On the left a patient who was admitted with\\n severe dyspnoe due to acute heart failure. The following signs indicate heart failure: alveolar edema with perihilar consolidations and air bronchograms (yellow arrows); pleural fl\\nuid (blue arrow); prominent azygos vein and increased width of the vascular pedicle (red arrow) and an enlarged cardiac silhouette (arrow heads). After treatment we can still see an\\n enlarged cardiac silhouette, pleural fluid and redistribution of the pulmonary blood flow, but the edema has resolved. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll On the left another patient with alveolar edema at admission, which resolved after treatment. When you scroll through the images and go back and forth, you will notic\\ne the difference in vascular pedicle width and distribution of pulmonary flow. Both on the chest x-ray and on the CT the edema is gravity dependent and differences in density can be\\n measured. Notice that even within each lobe there is a gravity dependent difference in density. This is only seen when the consolidations are the result of transudate like in CHF. \\nThis is not seen when the consolidations are the result of exsudate due to infection, blood due to hemorrhage or when there is a capillary leak like in ARDS. On the left a patient w\\nho first had a chest film in a supine position. Notice the pulmonary edema, which is almost exclusively seen in the right lung. A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be, \\nthat the patient had been lying on his right side for a while before the x-ray was taken.\\nCardiothoracic ratio:\\nOld film for comparison (left) CHF with redistribution, interstitial edema and some pleural fluid The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) is the ratio of the transverse diameter of the heart\\n to the internal diameter of the chest at its widest point just above the dome of the diaphragm as measured on a PA chest film. An increased cardiac silhouette is almost always the \\nresult of cardiomegaly, but occasionally it is due to pericardial effusion or even fat deposition. The heart size is considered too large when the CTR is > 50% on a PA chest x-ray. \\nA CTR of > 50% has a sensitivity of 50% for CHF and a specificity of 75-80%. An increase in left ventricular volume of at least 66% is necessary before it is noticeable on a chest x\\n-ray. On the left a patient with CHF. There is an increase in heart size compared to the old film. Other signs of CHF are visible, such as redistribution of pulmonary flow, intersti\\ntial edema and some pleural fluid. On a supine film the cardiac silhouette will be larger due to magnification and high position of the hemidiafragms. Exact measurements are not tha\\nt helpful, but comparison to old supine films can be of value. Increased CTR due to pericardial effusion On the left a patient, who recently underwent a valve replacement. There is \\na large cardiac silhouette, which could be the result of cardiomegaly. Because of the recent cardiac surgery, the possibility of pericardial effusion was taken into account, which i\\ns nicely demonstrated on the CT-image. On the left another patient with a large cardiac silhouette on the chest x-ray due to pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion is demonstrat\\ned on the coronal CT-reconstruction.\\nPleural effusion:\\nPleural effusion more evident on lateral view Pleural effusion is bilateral in 70% of cases of CHF. When unilateral, it is slightly more often on the right side than on the left sid\\ne. There has to be at least 175 ml of pleural fluid, before it will be visible on a PA image as a meniscus in the costophrenic angle. On a lateral image effusion of > 75 ml can be v\\nisible. If pleural effusion is seen on a supine chest film, it means that there is at least 500 ml present. On the left images of a patient who has bilateral pleural effusions. Noti\\nce that it is more evident on the lateral view. Subpulmonic pleural effusion with increased distance of the stomach air bubble to the lung base (arrow) Pleural effusion is not alway\\ns visible as a meniscus in the costophrenic angle. A subpulmonic effusion may follow the contour of the diaphragm making it tricky to discern. In these cases, the only way to detect\\n pleural effusion, is when you notice that there is an increased distance between the stomach bubble and the lung. The stomach is normally located directly under the diaphragm, so, \\non an erect PA radiograph, the stomach bubble should always appear in close proximity to the diaphragm and the lung. On the left images of a patient with signs of CHF. At first glan\\nce you might get the impression that there is a high position of the diaphragm. However when you notice the increased distance of the stomach air bubble to the lung base, you realiz\\ne that there is a large amount of pleural fluid on both sides (arrow).\\nVascular pedicle:\\nThe vascular pedicle is bordered on the right by the superior vena cava and on the left by the left subclavian artery origin (6). The vascular pedicle is an indicator of the intrava\\nscular volume. A vascular pedicle width less than 60 mm on a PA chest radiograph is seen in 90% of normal chest x-rays. A vascular pedicle width of more than 85 mm is pathologic in \\n80% of cases. 5 mm increase in diameter corresponds to 1 liter increase of intravascular fluid. An increase in width of the vascular pedicle is accompanied by an increased width of \\nthe azygos vein. Subtle increased width of vascular pedicle (left) and normalisation (right) There are three principal varieties of pulmonary edema: cardiac,\\noverhydration and increased capillary permeability (ARDS). The vascular pedicle width (VPW) can help in differentiating these different forms of pulmonary edema (6): Normal VPW in a\\n patient with ARDS On the left a patient with ARDS. There is alveolar edema in both lungs. Notice that the VPW is normal. The vessels in the upper lobes are not dilated and the card\\niac silhouette is not enlarged. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll The VPW is best used as a measure to compare serial chest x-rays of the same patient, as there is a wide range of values for the VPW. The VPW may increase due to rota\\ntion to the right. On an AP-view the VPW will increase 20% compared to a PA-view. On the left a patient with subtle signs of congestive heart failure on the initial chest x-ray (ima\\nge 1/2). There is a slightly enlarged vascular pedicle, which becomes more obvious when you compare to the chest film after diuretic therapy (image 2/2).\\nDilatation of azygos vein:\\nDilation of the azygos vein is a sign of increased right atrial pressure and is usually seen when there is also an increase in the width of the vascular pedicle. The diameter of the\\n azygos vein varies according to the positioning. In the standing position a diameter > 7 mm is most likely abnormal and a diameter > 10 mm is definitely abnormal. In a supine patie\\nnt > 15 mm is abnormal. An increase of 3 mm in comparison to previous films is suggestive of fluid overload. The difference of the azygos diameter on an inspiration film compared to\\n an expiration film is only 1mm. This means that the diameter of the azygos is a valuable tool whether or not there is good inspiration.\\nRight ventricular failure:\\nDilatation of IVC and hepatic veins on US images in a patient with RV failure RV failure is most commonly caused by longstanding LV failure, which increases the pulmonary venous pre\\nssure and leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension, thus overloading the RV. Other less common causes of RV failure are: Radiographic signs of RV failure: Sonographic signs of RV fa\\nilure: The indication for ultrasound examination in many of these patients is abnormal liver function tests. It is therefore important to consider the possibility of RV failure when\\n a patient presents with liver enzyme abnormalities. Under normal conditions dynamic ultrasound will demonstrate changes in caliber of the IVC.

To the far left is an image of a stricture (arrow) with irregular mucosal folds at stricture site on air-contras\\nt view. This patient had Barrett's esophagus. Mid esophageal strictures and ulcers are suspicious for Barrett's esophagus. The two images on the right show a Barrett's esophagus wit\\nh an irregular stricture due to adenocarcinoma. Here an image of a long, symmetric tapered benign stricture months after radiotherapy. Here are images of a patient with a benign str\\nicture high in the esophagus (arrow). There is bilateral lower lobe lung consolidation due to repeated aspiration. Approximately 5,000-15,000 cases of caustic ingestion occur in the\\n US every year. About 50%-80% occur in the pediatric population. On the left a high stricture (arrow) following caustic ingestion Osteophytes (arrow) can impinge on the esophagus an\\nd hypopharynx. However they rarely cause symptoms. Multiple structures are uncommon. The table shows diseases that may present with multiple esophageal strictures.

Epidermolysis bullosa This image is of a patient with benign epidermo\\nlysis bullosa. Multiple strictures (arrows) are a residual of mucosal bullous disease. Extensive bullous skin disease has led to webbed fingers and contractions. Corrosive ingestion\\n Corrosive ingestion can result in multiple strictures.\\nAcute esophageal syndromes:\\nIn the table on the left are etiologies of an acute esophageal syndrome.\\nBoerhaave syndrome:\\nBoerhaave syndrome is rupture of the esophageal wall. It is most often caused by excessive vomiting in eating disorders such as bulimia although it may rarely occur in extremely for\\nceful coughing or other situations, such as obstruction by food. Boerhaave syndrome is a transmural or full-thickness perforation of the esophagus, distinct from Mallory-Weiss syndr\\nome, a nontransmural esophageal tear also associated with vomiting. These syndromes are distinct from iatrogenic perforation, which accounts for 85-90% of cases of esophageal ruptur\\ne, typically as a complication of an endoscopic procedure, feeding tube, or unrelated surgery. This image is of a patient with Boerhaave syndrome. Chest radiographs show pneumomedia\\nstinum (arrows). Esophagram with extravasated water soluble contrast material in left hemithorax (asterisk) Perforation is almost always on the left side of distal esophagus. Radiog\\nraphs show mediastinal gas, effusion, and later pneumothorax. Esophagram is used to confirm leak, first with water-soluble contrast, then barium if no leak is demonstrated. Boerhaav\\ne's syndrome On the left a patient with Boerhaave syndrome. The barium study shows extraluminal gas (arrow) without contrast extravasation. CT shows extraluminal gas (arrows). Rent \\nof distal left esophagus confirmed at surgery. CT can show small amounts of extraluminal gas or extravasation not visible on radiographs or esophagram.\\nMallory-Weiss tear:\\nA Mallory-Weiss tear results from prolonged and forceful vomiting, coughing or convulsions. Typically the mucous membrane at the junction of the esophagus and the stomach develops l\\nacerations which bleed, evident by bright red blood in vomitus, or bloody stools. It may occur as a result of excessive alcohol ingestion. This is an acute condition which usually r\\nesolves within 10 days without special treatment. Mallory-Weiss tear On the left a patient with a Mallory-Weiss tear. Spot films show barium (arrows) in linear mucosal tear near gas\\ntroesophageal junction. Tears may be in distal esophagus, gastric fundus, or extend across the GE junction.\\nEsophageal hematoma:\\nThese unusual lesions have been associated with increased esophageal\\nintraluminal pressure, most often vomiting, instrumentation, and anticoagulation\\nor bleeding disorders. Some are spontaneous. Blunt trauma is a rare cause. Hematomas are self-limited and almost never progress to perforation. Most esophageal hematomas resolve in \\n1-2 weeks with conservative treatment. On the left a patient with an esophagus hematoma. He presented with chest pain and dysphagia after vomiting. Aside from tortuous aorta chest r\\nadiograph is normal. The barium study shows a narrowed lumen (arrows) on AP view and flattened lumen on lateral view (arrowheads) suggestive of a intramural hematoma. On CT the diag\\nnosis of an intramural hematoma was confirmed. A high density mural hematoma (arrowhead) is seen next to NG tube (arrow). Following conservative treatment, six months later the bari\\num study was normal. On the left a patient who had a complicated endoscopy. Instrumentation caused a mucosal tear and dissecting intramural hematoma resulting in double lumen with s\\neparating stripe of mucosa (arrows). On the far left an intramural extravasation (arrow) after distal dilation for achalasia. In the middle an intramural extravasation (arrow) after\\n complicated endoscopy.

Extrinsic lesions tend to form longer obtuse angles if not fixed to the esophageal wall, and the\\nir epicenter may be outside the esophagus. In practice, the location of a lesion may be difficult to determine. On radiograph, tumor (arrows) protrudes into azygoesophageal recess. \\nOn esophagram, the inferior margin of this intramural lesion forms close to a right angle (arrow) with esophageal wall.

Pedunculated fibrovascular polyps\\nFibrovascular polyp:\\nPedunculated fibrovascular polyps are rare lesions, that are difficult to diagnose on esophagrams. Their movement during the examination produces an inconstant position. Their shape\\n may be suggestive as in this patient. The stalk is often difficult to identify.\\nDuplication:\\nOn the left a patient with an esophageal duplication. The findings on the barium study are non-specific. Lesion (arrows) is visible behind the heart on radiograph. Esophageal narrow\\ning (arrows) is caused by duplication. A foregut duplication cyst is a congenital cyst. In the case on the left it displaces hypopharynx and opacified esophagus (arrow) posteriorly \\nand trachea and larynx (asterisk) anteriorly.\\nMalignant neoplasms:\\nHere a list of malignant esophageal masses. Early and small esophageal carcinoma are not synonymous. Early esophageal carcinoma is limited to the mucosa, submucosa with no lymph nod\\ne metastases. Most are small ( Small esophageal carcinoma is defined by the size of the lesion, a diameter So an early carcinoma may be small, but a small carcinoma may be invasive \\nor metastatic and thus not an early carcinoma. This image is of a patient with an early esophageal carcinoma. Lesion is not visible on single contrast esophagram. Air-contrast esoph\\nagram shows surface irregularity (arrows) indicating a mucosal lesion. This was both a small lesion and a pathologically early squamous carcinoma. LEFT: Small polypoid carcinoma. RI\\nGHT: Large polypoid lesion. Advanced carcinoma has many gross appearances: On the left two cases of polypoid carcinoma. Esophageal carcinoma with ulcerations (arrows) and sharp righ\\nt angle junction with esophageal wall (arrowheads) This image is of a patient with an infiltrative ulcerated carcinoma. This lesion has an abrupt transition forming an acute angle a\\nnd overhanging edge. This indicates mural involvement and is different than obtuse angles usually produced by extrinsic lesions that are not fixed to the esophagus. Varicoid carcino\\nma These images are of a patient with a varicoid carcinoma. Unchanging appearance of filling defects indicate tumor rather than varices. Note sharp upper margin of lesion and ulcera\\ntion (arrows) LEFT: Varicoid carcinoma. RIGHT: Superficial spreading carcinoma. To the far left an image of a patient with a varicoid carcinoma. Long lobulations simulate varices bu\\nt did not vary during fluoroscopy. Note large irregular folds and soft tissue mass (arrow) of gastric fundus Next to it an image of a patient with a superficial spreading carcinoma.\\n Extensive superficial spread involves distal esophagus. This appearance can be seen with both early and advanced lesions. LEFT: Long irregular distal stricture due to carcinomaRIGH\\nT: Distal narrowing is not tapered and more proximal than achalasia. Irregularity (arrow) at narrowed site is subtle but persistent On the far left a patient with a carcinoma with s\\ntricture. An irregular, asymmetric stricture is highly suggestive of carcinoma. Smoothly tapered, symmetric strictures are characteristic of a benign etiology, but malignant strictu\\nres can have similar characteristics and mimic benign lesions. Next to it a patient with a carcinoma with stricture resembling achalasia. Distal esophageal malignancy may closely re\\nsemble achalasia. If esophageal motility is normal, achalasia can be excluded. If abnormal, however, subtle imaging features; asymmetric, irregular, abrupt, or high narrowing, mucos\\nal abnormality, or fixed abnormality suggest diagnosis. On the left another case of pseudoachalasia.

The incidence of cancer in Barrett's however is controversial. Who, how, and when individuals s\\nhould be screened is unresolved. Adenocarcinoma was 10% of esophageal malignancies in 1960s. Since 1960s, incidence increasing in USA greater than any other carcinoma. Incidence now\\n approaching or exceeding squamous carcinoma in Caucasian men in the USA and Europe.

In this article we present a pictorial essay of neck masses in children and provide a diagnostic appro\\nach based on the location of the lesion and whether it is cystic or solid. Ultrasound is the imaging method of choice and in many cases a definite diagnosis is possible, especially \\nif the lesion is cystic. MRI is of value in large lesions, to determine whether the lesion infiltrates into deep spaces. CT is sometimes applied in acutely ill patients with infecti\\nons to assess whether an abscess is present. In suspected malignant lymphoma ultrasound can demonstrate which node is most accessible to image guided biopsy or excision, while PET/C\\nT is used for staging.\\nIntroduction:\\nDiagnostic approach:\\nIn a neck lesion in a child, ultrasound can usually determine whether a lesion is cystic or solid. Often more than one lymph node is enlarged. Try to differentiate between reactive \\nnodes, lymphadenitis due to TB or cat-scratch disease and malignant lymphoma.\\n* Solid - not a lymph nodeIf a solid lesion is not a lymph node look for a possible site of origin, like the salivary gland, the thyroid gland or the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sub\\ncutaneous solid lesions sometimes have a typical appearance, like pilomatrixomas, lipomas or hemangiomas. In many cases however a solid lesion will be non-specific and a diagnosis c\\nan only be made through biopsy or excision. Click on image to enlarge\\nLocation of cystic lesions:\\nOnce you have decided that the lesion is cystic its location will often point to its nature (figure). Midline lesions Midline lesions are either thyroglossal duct cysts, dermoid cys\\nts or ranulas. Older children can be asked to protrude their tongue. A thyroglossal duct cyst will move upward with the hyoid bone. Ranulas have a typical location in the floor of t\\nhe mouth. Off-midline lesions Off-midline lesions can be branchial cleft cysts or lymphangiomas. Branchial cleft cysts often contain debris. Anteriorly located lymphangiomas are oft\\nen multicystic. In the posterior neck they are often single.\\nCystic lesions:\\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. In neck lesions we first try to figure out whether a lesion is cystic or solid. In clear cystic lesions this is straightforward.\\n It can however be a problem if the cyst has been inflamed or when a cyst has bled, since children often present with a preexistent lesion that has bled. Try to elicit swirling of t\\nhe contents by compressive movements of the probe or by changing the position of the child and look for acoustic enhancement. The video shows a swelling, that appeared overnight in \\na 13-year-old girl. A hypo-echoic lesion is seen superficial to the carotid artery and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. No movement of the lesions content was seen when pinge\\nd with the probe. When the girl was asked to sit upright the contents swirled.\\nThyroglossal duct cyst:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 128}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Thyroglossal duct cysts are common lesions in children. The thyroglossal duct runs from the base of tongue at the foramen caecum to the thyroid gland. The embryonic thyroid gland tr\\navels through the duct to reach its final normal position. Normally, the thyroglossal duct then involutes, but when the duct persists, a thyroglossal duct cyst can develop anywhere \\nalong this tract (figure). Thyroglossal duct cysts move upward if the tongue is protruded or during swallowing (see next movie). Ultrasound is usually sufficient to make the diagnos\\nis. Always look for the presence of a normal thyroid gland and make an image of it. Sorry, your browser doesn\\'t support embedded videos. This videoclip demonstrates the upward movem\\nent of the thyroglossal duct cyst together with the hyoid bone during swallowing. Thyroglossal duct cyst Thyroglossal duct cysts can be anechoic or hypo-echoic with internal echoes,\\n due to infection, hemorrhage, or proteinaceous content. The majority of thyroglossal duct cysts is located within 2 cm of the midline. Here a tranverse image of a hypoechoic thyrog\\nlossal duct cyst with some internal echoes located in the midline. Thyroglossal duct cyst Here a tranverse image of an anechoic thyroglossal duct cyst just left of the midline. Typi\\ncal hyper-echoic dermoid cyst in the suprasternal notch.\\nDermoid cyst:\\nDermoid cysts are inclusion cysts, that contain epithelium and skin adnexa like hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands. 7% of dermoid cysts occur in the head and neck reg\\nion, especially around the orbit and in the midline of the neck, with a predilection for the suprasternal notch. Here a typical homogeneous hyper-echoic oval lesion, representing a \\ndermoid cyst, which was located in its favorite location, the suprasternal notch. Dermoid cyst In the neck dermoid cysts are generally homogeneously hyperechoic, although they can b\\ne inhomogeneous. The differentiation from a thyroglossal duct cyst can be difficult if the dermoid cyst is located near the hyoid bone. The content of thyroglossal duct cysts is usu\\nally hypo-echoic and may contain internal echoes, while dermoid cysts generally have a more homogeneous hyper-echoic content. Here an unusual inhomogeneous appearance of a dermoid c\\nyst in front of the thyroid gland (figure). Orbital dermoid cyst The most common location of a dermoid cyst in the head-neck region is around the orbit, typically at the upper outer\\n corner. On ultrasound they are anechoic and one should look for the presence of a bony lining. If the integrity of the bony lining is uncertain, a CT or MRI is necessary to determi\\nne possible intracranial extension. Here a typical orbital dermoid cyst. It was firm on palpation and located at the lateral border of the orbit. On ultrasound it is anechoic with r\\nemodelling of the underlying bone.\\nBranchial cleft cyst:\\nMost branchial cysts are remnants of the second brancial cleft. Cysts at the level of the thyroid gland can be remnants of the third or fourth branchial cleft. Incomplete obliterati\\non results in either a cyst (75%), a sinus or a fistula (25%). Cysts present as painless masses, sometimes appearing suddenly after internal hemorrhage. They are located along the a\\nnterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lateral to the common carotid artery, and if more cranially between the internal and external carotid artery. Sometimes a beak sign\\n may be seen as a curved rim of the lesion pointing medially between the internal and external carotid. Typical ultrasound appearance of a branchial cleft cyst with echogenic debris\\n. On ultrasound they often contains internal echoes caused by debris, which consists of cholesterol crystals. The cyst is usually compressible, which results in movement of the cont\\nent. This may not be the case in a cyst with a fresh internal hemorrhage. They can inflame and present with an empyema. Here another branchial cyst with a typical location superfici\\nal to the carotid artery bifurcation. Branchial sinuses Branchial sinuses are blind ending tracts, presenting anterior of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Branchial second arch fistu\\nlas end in the tonsillar fossa, as can be demonstrated with a contrast fistulogram or MRI. With ultrasound a tract can often be seen to travel upwards, but it is usually not possibl\\ne to depict the proximal ending. Here a two-year-old boy with a dirty spot in the right lower neck. A small tract could be seen to extend inwards. At operation a second branchial fi\\nstula was excised. Here a ten-year-old girl with a pit in the right neck, anterior of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. On US a long cystic lesion can be seen which can be traced up t\\no the right submandibular region. At operation, the fistula extended towards the right tonsillar fossa and was excised.\\nLymphangioma:\\nLymphangiomas are cystic lesions, caused by maldevelopment of the lymph channels. The majority occur in young children, with 90% in the head and neck region. In the posterior neck a\\n lymphangioma usually has one or more larger cysts. In the anterior neck a lymphangioma can consist of innumerable small cysts, and may infiltrate deeply into the neck or mediastinu\\nm. This is also called a hygroma colli. The sonographic appearance depends on the size and number of cysts. Larger cysts are mostly anechoic or may contain some debris. A microcysti\\nc lymphangioma can be hyper-echoic due to the high number of closely related reflecting walls. Here an ultrasound of a typical lymphangioma. MRI was performed because the extension \\nof the lesion was not clear. Here the T2-weighted image of the same patient. On T1-weighted images the content has a variable signal intensity, depending on its protein or blood con\\ntent. It generally has a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Contrast enhanced T1 can show enhancement of the wall. Here an ultrasound image of a six-year-old girl with a s\\nudden swelling in the left neck. There were several small anechoic cysts and one large cyst containing internal echoes, which were probably the result of a bleeding in a preexistent\\n lymphangioma. A 3-year-old boy presented suddenly with a supraclavicular mass. Ultrasound showed a lesion with echogenic debris. A hemorrhage in a preexisting lymphangioma was susp\\nected. Continue with the MRI. The T1-weighted image shows a slightly hyperintense lesion with a fluid-fluid level (arrow). After gadolineum administration there is enhancement of th\\ne cyst wall. The lesion subsided with conservative therapy. Ranula\\nRanula:\\nA ranula is a fluid filled cyst originating from the sublingual salivary gland. It can extend into the floor of the mouth and be visible on inspection of the oral cavity. It can als\\no extend through or over the mylohyoid muscle and is then called a \"plunging ranula\" and present as a submental or submandibular mass. Here an image of a sixteen-year-old boy with a\\n firm swelling under the tongue on the left side. Ultrasound showed an anechoic mass continuous with the sublingual salivary gland. Sorry, your browser doesn\\'t support embedded vide\\nos.\\nJugular ectasia:\\nIn some children a swelling can appear in the lower neck during straining. This is often caused by dilatation of the internal jugular vein as can easily be demonstrated by ultrasoun\\nd that will show the variations in caliber of the vein. An example is shown on the video of a seven-year-old boy, initially suspected of a laryngocele.\\nSolid lesions - Lymph nodes:\\nThis image shows a commonly used classification for the location of lymph nodes. Submental and submandibular nodes\\n* Level 2 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, above the level of the hyoid bone\\n* Level 3 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, between the hyoid bone and cricoid cartilage\\n* Level 4 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, below the cricoid cartilage\\n* Level 5 Posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the clavicles\\n* Level 6 Anterior to the thyroid gland Normal lymph nodes are always visible with ultrasound in children. A normal lymph node: The normal jugulodigastric node which is located belo\\nw the mandibular angle can have a short axis of 15 mm. Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck are very common in children. In most cases these are reactive nodes as a reaction to a nearby\\n infection. Less commonly it is due to a primary infection of the lymph nodes itself, which is called lymphadenitis. Usually the terms reactive lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis are\\n used synonymously. Although ultrasound cannot always reliably distinguish lymphadenitis from a malignant lymphoma, the following table can be helpful to decide whether an excision \\nbiopsy should be done or that a \"wait and scan\" policy can be adopted. Supraclavicular lymph nodes should always be considered to be malignant until proven otherwise.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 129}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Reactive lymph nodes:\\nReactive lymph nodes are a reaction to nearby inflammation. They are slightly enlarged and more hypoechoic than normal with a broader echogenic center. Here a six-year-old boy with \\nweight loss, fatigue and lymphadenopathy. On ultrasound a string of enlarged lymph nodes with preservation of a echogenic hilum was seen. Excision biopsy showed reactive lymph nodes\\n. Here a two-year-old girl with a palpable swelling in the left neck since a few weeks. On ultrasound the lymph nodes are enlarged with preservation of the echogenic hilus and norma\\nl perfusion. It was decided to wait and see and the nodes slowly shrunk.\\nBacterial or viral lymphadenitis:\\nA bacterial or viral lymphadenitis is an infection of the node itself. Bacterial lymphadenitis is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or B-hemolytic Streptococcus. The nodes, whic\\nh are frequently located in the submandibular region, are painful and the skin is warm and red. Bacterial lymphadenitis has an acute onset and is usually unilateral. The ultrasound \\nimage is of a one-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck for three weeks. A partly liquefied lymphnode is seen with infiltration of the surrounding subcutaneous fat. The swelling \\ndisappeared on antibiotic treatment. Abscess formation is clinically difficult to detect, and ultrasound is also not reliable. Signs of liquefaction are areas with a detectable wall\\n and more hypoechoic center or areas with mobile, moving echoreflections. According to the literature there are 30% false-positive ánd false-negative results. Here a one-year-old bo\\ny with a swelling in the right neck for one week. Ultrasound shows an enlarged lymph node with areas of liquefaction. It was incised and drained, after which the infection subsided.\\nCat-scratch disease:\\nCat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae. The infection is the result of a scratch or bite of a cat. It is the most common cause of chronic axillary lymphadenopathy. The\\n symptoms are often mild and lymph node swelling can be prolonged. The clinical diagnosis can be difficult and PCR results are insensitive. On ultrasound the affected nodes are roun\\nd, heterogeneously hypoechoic, hypervascular, and with some surrounding inflammation. The nodes are a bit tender but not painful. They can be difficult to distinguish from malignant\\n nodes. Here an ultrasund image of a sixteen-year-old girl, who was treated for recurrence of acute lymphatic leukaemia. Six months after the last treatment, she developed a swellin\\ng in the left shoulder region. A hypoechoic node without any internal structure was seen. It was excised. The final diagnosis was, surprisingly, Bartonella henselae. Sorry, your bro\\nwser doesn't support embedded videos. Cat-scratch disease 2 Here a video of a fifteen-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck. There are multiple lymph nodes with surrounding infil\\ntrated tissue. Continue with next video. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. After a week suppuration was seen. Aspirated pus was positive for Bartonella henselae. \\nThe boy was successfully treated with antibiotics. Two-year-old boy with a progressive swelling in the neck. No effect of antibiotics. An atypical Mycobacterium infection (avium) wa\\ns confirmed. The anechoic parts (arrow) in the node are often seen in atypical Mycobacteria infection.\\nMycobacteria:\\nInfection with atypical Mycobacteria generally occurs in patients between one and five years of age. There are few clinical symptoms, most often only a palpable mass. The enlarged l\\nymph nodes are usually unilateral and in the pre-auricular or submandibular area. There is often a pronounced skin discoloration. Tuberculosis (TB) and atypical Mycobacteria frequen\\ntly present with a single enlarged node and some smaller satellite lesions. There is central necrosis, thickening of the overlying skin, surrounding inflammation and after a while a\\n confluent mass. Fistulas may be present. Calcifications are seen more commonly in TB infections than in atypical Mycobacterial infections, especially after treatment. Continue with\\n next image... Three months later the swelling is still present. The deeper lymphnode has liquefied. After another four months a lymph node had undergone liquefaction and discharged\\n in the surrounding tissue. Here an ultrasound image of a 6-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck. Fine calcifications are seen in the lymph node. The Mantoux and Qferon test wer\\ne positive, but cultures for tuberculosis were negative. The patient was treated with tuberculostatics with good result.\\nMalignant lymphoma:\\nMalignant lymphoma presents with painless lymphadenopathy. In Hodgkin lymphoma the cervical nodes are most commonly involved, while in non-Hodgkin lymphoma the nodes of the Waldeyer\\n ring are often involved. On ultrasound the affected nodes are round, homogeneously hypoechoic and the normal echogenic hilum is absent. The diagnosis is made by ultrasound-guided b\\niopsy or excision. PET/CT will demonstrate the extension of the disease. The images are of a fourteen-year-old boy with a painless swelling in the left neck. The ultrasound shows se\\nveral enlarged hypoechoic lymhnodes, that lack an hyper-echoic hilum. Here another fourteen-year-old boy with a painless swelling in the left neck. Ultrasound showed several enlarge\\nd lymhnodes. Continue with the MR and PET/CT... A coronal STIR image shows the pathologic lymph node masses similar to the PET-CT. The diagnosis was Hodgkin's lymphoma.\\nSolid lesions - not lymph nodes:\\nThe most common cause of a solid lesion in the neck is an enlarged lymph node as we just discussed. Other solid lesions in the neck are far less common. They are listed in the table\\n. In many cases the imaging findings in a solid lesion will be non-specific and a diagnosis can only be made through biopsy or excision.\\nThyroid lesions:\\nCongenital anomalies The most common anomalie is a partial or complete agenesis of the gland. In partial agenesis the gland is ectopic and located anywhere between the base of the t\\nongue and the thyroid cartilage. Mostly near or in the tongue, a lingual thyroid. Here an image of a newborn with an abnormal thyroid test. No thyroid gland is visible in the neck, \\nneither in its usual position nor higher up in the neck. Thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules are common. They can be single or multiple. Some are purely cystic but most are solid. On ul\\ntrasound they are isoechoic with the normal gland. In a goiter a multitude of solid nodules are seen. If there is concern about a possible malignancy fine needle aspiration can be d\\none. Preferably a technician of the cytology department is present to make a quick assessment of the retrieved cells to ascertain that thyroid cells are aspirated, and not only bloo\\nd. This is an ultrasound image of a six-year-old girl with a small cyst with a septum in the right thyroid lobe. It remained unchanged over a year. Hashimoto's thyroiditis: An enlar\\nged thyroid gland with a diffuse inhomogeneous structure and hyperemia is seen in a ten-year-old girl Thyroiditis The most common forms of thyroiditis are Hashimoto's thyroiditis an\\nd Graves disease. Both Hashimoto's thyreoiditis and Graves disease can present as an enlarged and hyperemic thyroid. Hashimoto's thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is an\\n auto-immune disease. It presents with hypothyroidism. Although primarily a disease of the middle-aged it can present in children. On ultrasound the gland is diffusely enlarged and \\ninhomogeneous. On color doppler the blood flow is often normal but can be increased like in Graves' disease. In a later stage the gland shrinks. Graves disease In Graves disease the\\n thyroid gland is also enlarged and shows an increased perfusion. On color Doppler it has been described as an inferno in red and blue. Here an image of a 16-year-old girl with hype\\nrthreoidism. A diffusely enlarged thyroid gland is seen with hyperemia. The final diagnosis was Graves disease. She was treated with I-131. Ultrasound image of the thymus in a two-m\\nonths-old boy.\\nThymus:\\nThe thymus is located in the upper mediastinum and can be visualized with a suprasternal scan plane. With increasing age its echogenicity increases and becomes more granular. Ultras\\nound is ideal to demonstrate the thymus as a cause of a widened upper mediastinum in infants. Sometimes the thymus causes a swelling in the suprasternal notch on straining. Such a h\\nerniating thymus can be demostrated with ultrasound. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.

It is probably caused by pressure necrosis of the muscle during delivery. Contrary to common belief\\n it is not caused by hemorrhage. 50% of affected babies are born in breech. The swelling becomes apparent one to three weeks after birth. Sometimes a torticollis is noted. The swell\\ning will usually regress spontaneously within a few months. On ultrasound an enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is seen. It can affect the whole muscle or part of it. The\\n sternal head is always affected, and often the cleidal head as well. It can be hypo-, iso- or hyperechoic. Longitudinal images of the swelling will demonstrate its muscular origin.\\n Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Here a video of a two-month-old boy with a torticollis. A mass is seen within the enlarged sternocleidomastoid muscle. The diag\\nnosis is fibromatosis collis Hemangioma\\nVascular anomalies:\\nVascular anomalies are classified into proliferative vascular tumors and vascular malformations. This classification is important as the treatment is different. Some vascular tumors\\n will regress spontaneously or after administration of beta-blockers. Vascular malformations however need excision, sclerosing, or embolisation, if treatment is requested. The class\\nifications of these lesions is constantly changing and beyond the scope of this article. A recent article on vascular anomalies provides a new classification (2). Hemangioma Hemangi\\nomas are benign vascular neoplasms. They are the most common tumors of infancy. 60% of hemangiomas are seen in the head-neck regio. They usually appear in the first weeks after birt\\nh, show rapid growth, followed by spontaneous involution. Here we see images of a highly vascular lesion in the left submandibular region, which was present at birth. Three months l\\nater it had decreased in size. Infantile hemangioma A soft swelling was present on the side of the head in a six-week-old boy. It was small at birth and showed rapid growth. This is\\n typical for an infantile hemangioma. Venous malformation Venous malformation A six-month-old boy presented with a swelling in the left neck at birth. Several ultrasound examination\\ns could not differentiate between a hemangioma or a venous malformation. At six months of age, the ultrasound showed a lesion, which was mostly composed of vessels which increased i\\nn size on straining. On color Doppler the lesion showed increased flow while crying. The final diagnosis on imaging and on clinical examination was a venous malformation. Firm tumor\\n in the right temporal area of a 2-year-old boy. Ultrasound shows an echogenic lesion with a well demarcated wall and slight posterior shadowing, characteristic for a pilomatrixoma.\\nPilomatrixoma:\\nA pilomatrixoma or epithelial inclusion cyst of Malherbe is a benign skin lesion associated with hairfollicles. It presents as a firm, mobile, painless swelling. Sometimes a blue di\\nscoloration is present. They vary in size from a few millimetres to 3 centimetres. The majority occurs in the head and neck region. On ultrasound a pilomatrixoma presents as an oval\\n tumor lcated between the cutis and subcutis. It is hyperechoic, sometimes with calcification and acoustic shadowing. The wall is often hypoechoic and on color Doppler tiny vessels \\ncan be seen in the wall. These images are of a firm mass in the neck of a 17-year-old girl. A cytologic sampling was inconclusive. Ultrasound shows a typical pilomatrixoma, confirme\\nd at pathology after excision. Some perfusion in the wall of the pilomatrixoma is seen. Large pilomatrixoma on the upper arm of a 12-year-old girl.\\nSalivary glands:\\nEnlargement of the salivary glands can be diffuse or focal. Diffuse swelling mostly affects the parotid glands. If it is bilateral it can be caused by autoimmune diseases (like Sjög\\nren's disease) or infections (HIV). On ultrasound many small hypoechoic lesions are present. Unilateral swelling can be caused by a bacterial parotitis. Hemangioma is the most commo\\nn parotid gland tumor of childhood, which involute in the course of a few months.\\nTeratoma:\\nTeratomas of the neck are rare in children. Teratomas are composed of all three germ layers. They often present at birth. On ultrasound they are composed of solid and cystic parts a\\nnd often contain calcifications. They can have a close connection to the thyroid gland. If the extension is unclear MRI can be done. Here we see a midline tumor in the anterior neck\\n of a three-day-old boy. Calcifications and solid and cystic parts are seen. Pathology was compatible with a mature teratoma.\\nParaganglioma:\\nHere images of a 17-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck, thought to represent a branchial cleft cyst. An echogenic solid mass was seen with moderate perfusion on color doppler \\nexamination. No specific diagnosis could be made. The final pathologic diagnosis was a paraganglioma, a very uncommon finding in children.\\nNeurofibroma:\\nHere a large neurofibroma in the subcutaneous tissue in the neck of a 10-year-old boy with a known neurofibromatosis.\\nNeuroblastoma:\\nNeuroblastoma usually presents as an abdominal mass in young children. In the neck it accounts for 1-5% of neuroblastomas. On ultrasound a heterogeneously echogenic mass is seen, of\\nten with some calcifications (1). Here a ten-month-old girl with a lump in the neck. Ultrasound shows a inhomogeneous mass with some calcifications. There were also three enlarged l\\nymph nodes with calcifications. Imaging could not make a definitive diagnosis.

Abbreviations used: SBC = Simple Bone Cyst Introduction\\nIntroduction:\\nOn the left the most common well-defined bone tumors and tumor-like lesions. These lesions are sometimes referred to as benign cystic lesions, which is a misnomer since most of them\\n are not cystic, except for SBC and ABC. It is true that in patients under 30 years a well-defined border means that we are dealing with a benign lesion, but in patients over 40 yea\\nrs metastases and multiple myeloma have to be included in the differential diagnosis. On the left a table with well-defined osteolytic bone tumors and tumor-like lesions in differen\\nt age-groups. Notice the following:\\nFegnomashic:\\nMost bone tumors present as well-defined osteolytic lesions, sometimes referred to as 'bubbly lesions'. It is important to have a good differential diagnostic approach to these lesi\\nons. You can use the table above, but another way to look at the differential diagnosis of well defined osteolytic bone lesions is to use the mnemonic Fegnomashic, which is populari\\nzed by Clyde Helms (1). Some prefer to use the mnemonic Fogmachines, which is formed by the same letters, but is a real word. Fibrous dysplasia: various presentations with or withou\\nt sclerotic margin, with groundglass appearance, with calcifications or ossifications\\nFibrous dysplasia:\\nFibrous dysplasia is a benign disorder characterized by tumor-like proliferation of fibro-osseus tissue and can look like anything. FD most commonly presents as a long lesion in a l\\nong bone. FD is often purely lytic and takes on ground-glass look as the matrix calcifies. In many cases there is bone expansion and bone deformity. The ipsilateral proximal femur i\\ns invariably affected when the pelvis is involved. When FD in the tibia is considered, adamantinoma should be in the differential diagnosis. Discriminator: More on Fibrous dysplasia\\nEnchondroma:\\nEnchondroma is a benign cartilage tumor. Frequently it is a coincidental finding. In the phalanges of the hand it frequently presents with a fracture. It is the most common lesion i\\nn the phalanges, i.e. a well-defined lytic lesion in the hand is almost always an enchondroma. In some locations it can be difficult to differentiate between enchondroma and bone in\\nfarct. It is almost impossible to differentiate between enchondroma and low grade chondrosarcoma based on radiographic features alone. Ollier's disease is multiple enchondromas. Maf\\nfucci's syndrome is multiple enchondromas with soft tissue hemangiomas. Features that favor the diagnosis of a low-grade chondrosarcoma: Discriminators :\\nEosinophilic granuloma:\\nEG is a non-neoplastic proliferation of histiocytes and is also known as Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of any sclerotic or osteo\\nlytic lesion, either well-defined or ill-defined, in patients under the age of 30. The diagnosis EG can be excluded in age > 30. EG is usually monostotic, but can be polyostotic. Di\\nscriminator: Giant cell tumor in the tibia abuts the articular surface\\nGiant cell tumor:\\nGiant cell tumor is a lesion with multinucleated giant cells. In most cases it is a benign lesion. Malignant GCT is rare and differentiation between benign or malignant GCT is not p\\nossible based on the radiographs. GCT is also included in the differential diagnosis of an ill-defined osteolytic lesion, provided the age and the site of the lesion are compatible.\\n Discriminators: NOF: typical presentation as an eccentric, multi-loculated subcortical lesion with a central lucency and a scalloped sclerotic margin.\\nNOF:\\nNOF is a benign well-defined, solitary lesion due to proliferation of fibrous tissue. It is the most common bone lesion. NOF is frequently a coincidental finding with or without a f\\nracture. NOF usually has a sclerotic border and can be expansile. They regress spontaneously with gradual fill in. NOF may occur as a multifocal lesion. The radiographic appearance \\nis almost always typical, and as such additional imaging and biopsy is not warranted. Discriminators:\\nOsteoblastoma:\\nOsteoblastoma is a rare solitary, benign tumor that produces osteoid and bone. Consider osteoblastoma when ABC is in the differential diagnosis of a spine lesion (figure). A typical\\n osteoblastoma is larger than 2 cm, otherwise it completely resembles osteoid osteoma. Discriminator:\\nMetastases:\\nMetastases are the most common malignant bone tumors. Metastases must be included in the differential diagnosis of any bone lesion, whether well-defined or ill-defined osteolytic or\\n sclerotic in age > 40. Bone metastases have a predilection for hematopoietic marrow sites: spine, pelvis, ribs, cranium and proximal long bones: femur, humerus. Metastases can be i\\nncluded in the differential diagnosis if a younger patient is known to have a malignancy, like neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma. Most common osteolytic metastases: ki\\ndney, lung, colon and melanoma. Most common osteosclerotic metastases: prostate and breast. Discriminator: Multiple Myeloma: multiple lytic lesions in the humerus\\nMultiple Myeloma:\\nMultiple myeloma must be included in the differential diagnosis of any lytic bone lesion, whether well-defined or ill-defined in age > 40. The most common location is in the axial s\\nkeleton (spine, skull, pelvis and ribs) and in the diaphysis of long bones (femur and humerus). Most common presentation: multiple lytic 'punched out' lesions. Multiple myeloma does\\n not show any uptake on bone scan. Discriminator: Multiple Myeloma (2) Differential diagnosis: On the left a CT-image of a patient with multiple myeloma. Notice the numerous osteoly\\ntic lesions and permeative cortical destruction pattern. In the left sacral wing there is a larger lesion with a high density due to replacement of fatty bone marrow by myeloma (red\\n arrow). ABC of the proximal fibula: well-defined, expansile osteolytic lesion with thin peripheral bone shell\\nAneurysmal Bone Cyst:\\nABC is a solitary expansile well-defined osteolytic bone lesion, that is filled with blood. It is named aneurysmal because it is expansile. ABC is thought to be the result of a reac\\ntive process secondary to trauma or increased venous pressure. Sometimes an underlying lesion like GCT, osteoblastoma or chondroblastoma can be found. ABC can occur almost anywhere \\nin the skeleton. Discriminators: More on ABC SBC: well-defined osteolytic lesion without expansion of the proximal meta-diaphysis of the humerus with pathologic fracture\\nSolitary Bone Cyst:\\nSolitary bone cyst, also known as unicameral bone cyst, is a true cyst. Many well-defined osteolytic lesions are often called cystic, but this is a misnomer. SBC frequently presents\\n with a fracture. Sometimes a fallen fragment is appreciated. Predilection sites: proximal humerus and femur. Usually less expansion compared with ABC. Differential diagnosis: ABC, \\nFD when cystic. SBC may migrate from metaphysis to diaphysis during growth of the bone. Discriminators:\\nHyperparathyroidism:\\nBrown tumors can occur in any bone and present as osteolytic lesions with sharp margins. Septa and ridges may be seen.

Multiple well-defined osteolytic lesions were found on a follow up CT s\\ncan. The differential diagnosis included metastases and Brown tumors in hyperparathyroidism. Biopsy revealed Brown tumor. Discriminators: Osteomyelitis\\nInfection:\\nInfection or osteomyelitis is the great mimicker of bone tumors. It has a broad spectrum of radiographic features and occurs at any age and has no typical location. In the chronic s\\ntage it can mimic a benign bone tumor (Brodies abscess). In the acute stage it can mimic a malignant bone tumor with ill-defined margins, cortical destruction and an aggressive type\\n of periostitis. Only when there is a thick solid periosteal reaction we can recognize the non-malignant underlying process. Discriminators: Chondroblastoma: notice extensive edema \\n(middle) and fluid-fluid level due to secondary ABC.\\nChondroblastoma:\\nThe patella, carpal and tarsal bones can be regarded as epiphysis concerning the differential diagnosis.

In the illustration the five different segments of the trigeminal nerve are presented, which will be discussed in m\\nore detail in the following chapters. Brainstem: trigeminal nucleus *Cisternal segment* *Meckel's cave* Cavernous segment Peripheral segment\\nBrain stem segment:\\nPathology in the\\nbrain stem segment is most often due to demyelination by multiple\\nsclerosis. \\nOther types of pathology in the brain stem segment are neoplasms\\n(mostly glioma and metastases), vascular lesions (infarction, cavernoma) and\\ninfections (rhombencephalitis). The trigeminal nerve originates from two separate nuclei in\\nthe pons: the sensory division from the sensory nucleus (green dot) and the motor division\\nfrom the motor nucleus (red dot).\\nThis first part is called the brain stem segment. From these nuclei, the trigeminal nerve courses anteriorly,\\nto the ventrolateral surface of the pons to continue with the cisternal segment in the prepontine cistern. The trigeminal nerve is the largest of all cranial nerves. \\nIt consists of a sensory and a motor division. The sensory division – which is the largest of the two – innervates sensibility in the whole face. The smaller motor division innervat\\nes: The sensory nucleus is situated laterally in the tegmentum, anterolateral to the fourth ventricle (green dot). The motor nucleus is situated anteromedial to the sensory nucleus \\n(red dot). This image is of a 26 year old male who developed slowly progressive facial hypesthesy on the\\nright. The axial T2W image shows a hyperintense lesion at the\\ntrigeminal nucleus (arrow). \\nThis may be a sign of demyelinsation, for\\ninstance in multiple sclerosis\\nCisternal segment:\\nThe cisternal segment is – almost without exception - the source of a true trigeminal neuralgia caused by neurovascular compression. Other causes of pathology in the cisternal\\nsegment causing trigeminal neuropathy are far less common, like neoplasms, mostly schwannoma, meningioma and epidermoid. Furthermore, the cisternal segment may be subject to infecti\\non or inflammation, for instance trigeminal neuritis.\\nNeurovascular compression:\\nNeurovascular compression is defined by specific radiologic criteria: Neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve is most often caused by contact with the superior cerebellar \\nartery (SCA) or less frequently the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), or smaller branches of the basilar artery. Only a few cases have been reported in which neurovascular\\n compression was caused by contact with an aneurysm, vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia, an AVM, an AV-fistula or even a vein. Root entry zone\\nThe cisternal segment starts where the trigeminal\\nnerve enters the prepontine cistern. \\nThis is called the root entry zone. \\nThe root entry zone comprises the transition zone from central\\nmyelin (oligodendrocytes) to peripheral myelin (Schwann cells). This transition zone measures approximately 2 mm long and is situated at approximately 5-7 mm from the surface of the\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 133}),\n",

In the prepontine cistern, the sensory and motor divisions have a parallel but separate course, creating a characteristic fan-li\\nke appearance (arrow). Neurovascular compression at the root entry zone A 74 year old male  has been experiencing\\nan ‘220V-like’ pain in his right eyebrow, cheek and mandible. \\nThese symptoms are\\nevoked by washing his face and brushing his teeth.

Trigeminal schwannoma These images are of a 49-year old\\n male with sensory problems in the left side of his face and pressure behind\\n his left eye. The axial T2W shows\\n a lesion in Meckel’s cave and the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve.\\n The component in Meckel’s cave is solid and shows homogeneous enhancement on\\n post-contrast T1W imaging (arrow). \\nThe component in the cerebellopontine cistern is\\n almost completely cystic and shows only rim enhancement. The lesion is a\\n trigeminal schwannoma. \\nThe growth of this lesion along the nerve, leading to\\n a constriction at the entrance of Meckel’s cave, causes the classic ‘dumbbell\\n shape’.\\nMeckel's cave segment:\\nPathology in Meckel’s cave leading to trigeminal\\nneuropathy, mostly concerns neoplasms, either primary, secondary or extrinsic. Primary lesions, originating from the nerve itself,\\nare mostly schwannomas, meningeomas, and epidermoids. Secondary neoplasms – involving the nerve, but not\\noriginating from it -  are mostly based\\non perineural spread.  The spread can be\\nretrograde (from the peripheral branches) or antergrade (from the cisternal\\nsegment). Extrinsic lesions mostly originate from the skull\\nbase. After traversing the cerebellopontine and prepontine\\ncisterns, the trigeminal nerve enters Meckel’s cave, which forms the third\\nsegment. \\nIn Meckel’s cave the trigeminal ganglion is located also known as Gasser’s or semilunate ganglion. At\\nthe ganglion, the sensory division of the trigeminal nerve divides into three\\nparts: The motor division does not pass through the ganglion, but rather underneath it. Together with nV3, the motor division leaves the\\nintracranial compartment via the foramen ovale.

These lesions – mostly schwannomas, meningeomas\\nand epidermoids – usually originate from the third segment, extending into the cavernous sinus. \\nTrigeminal lesions in the cavernous segment are mostly secondary due to perineural spread or\\nmetastases. Furthermore, pathology of the cavernous segment may be due to\\nextrinsic lesions, for instance lesions originating from the skull base, the\\nmeninges or vascular structures, for instance carotid aneurysms. Moreover, the\\ncavernous segment may be subject to infectious or inflammatory pathology, for\\ninstance Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, which is a severe unilateral periorbital headache associated with painful and restricted eye movements. The first two\\n branches of the trigeminal nerve – the ophthalmic nerve and the\\n maxillary nerve – continue their course from Meckel’s cave into the\\n cavernous sinus.

The \\ntraditional morphological anatomy is based on the external appearance of the liver and does not show the internal features of vessels and biliary ducts branching, which are of obvio\\nus importance in hepatic surgery. The French surgeon and anatomist Claude Couinaud was the first to divide the liver into eight functionally indepedent segments allowing resection o\\nf segments without damaging other segments.\\nSegmental anatomy:\\nSegmental anatomy according to Couinaud.

In the periphery of each segment there is vascular outflow through the hepatic veins\\n.\\nThe liver is divided in three vertical planes: Here another illustration of the functional segmental liver anatomy. Portal vein \\nThe portal vein divides the liver into upper and lower segments.\\nThe left and right portal veins branch superiorly and inferiorly to project into the center of each segment. Left hepatic vein\\nThe significance of the left hepatic vein is somewhat controversial. Some authors have shown it to coincide with the umbilical fissure, but in reality the left hepatic vein courses \\nto the lateral to the umbilical fissure [fig].\\nWhile some authors have claimed that the division between segments II and III is formed by the transverse plane of the left portal vein, most investigators feel that it is the plane\\n defined by the left hepatic vein.\\nIn actual practice, when a lesion is located within the lateral segment of the left lobe, both Couinaud segments II and III are usually removed based on the plane formed by the umbi\\nlical fissure (i.e. left lateral segmentectomy). On a frontal view of the liver the posteriorly located segments VI and VII are not visible. The illustration above is a schematic pr\\nesentation of the liver segments. In reality however the proportions are different. On a normal frontal view the segments VI and VII are not visible because they are located more po\\nsteriorly. The right border of the liver is formed by segment V and VIII. Although segment IV is part of the left hemiliver, it is situated more to the right. Couinaud divided the l\\niver into a functional left and right liver by a main portal scissurae containing the middle hepatic vein. This is known as Cantlie\\'s line. Cantlie\\'s line runs from the middle of th\\ne gallbladder fossa anteriorly to the inferior vena cava posteriorly. Clockwise numbering of the segments\\nSegments numbering:\\nThere are eight liver segments. Segment IV is sometimes divided into segment IVa and IVb according to Bismuth. The numbering of the segments is in a clockwise manner. Segment I (the\\n caudate lobe) is located posteriorly. It is not visible on a frontal view.

Image at the level of the l\\neft portal vein. This is a transverse image at the level of the left portal vein. At this level the left portal vein divides the left lobe into the superior segments (II and IVa) an\\nd the inferior segments (III and IVb). The left portal vein is at a higher level than the right portal vein. Image at the level of the right portal vein. This image is at the level \\nof the right portal vein.

The lev\\nel of the right portal vein is inferior to the level of the left portal vein. Image at the level of the splenic vein. At the level of the splenic vein, which is below the level of t\\nhe right portal vein, only the inferior segments are visible.\\nHow to separate liver segments on cross sectional imaging:\\nLeft liver: lateral(II/III) vs medial segment (IVA/B) Extrapolate a line along the falciform ligament superiorly to the confluence of the left and middle hepatic veins at the IVC (b\\nlue line). Left vs Right liver: IVA/B vs V/VIII Extrapolate a line from the gallbladder fossa superiorly along the middle hepatic vein to the IVC (red line).

This CT-image is of a patient with liver c\\nirrhosis with extreme atrophy of the right lobe, normal volume of the left lobe and hypertrophy of the caudate lobe.

Sanje\\nev Bhalla is section chief of the Cardiothoracic Imaging Section of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology. This review will focus on how to narrow down the differential diagnosis \\nof mediastinal lesions by localizing and characterizing them.\\nIntroduction:\\nWhenever you see a mass on a chest x-ray that is possibly located within the mediastinum, your goal is to determine the following: The table on the left is the overall table for med\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 136}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"iastinal masses. In the next paragraphs we will discuss each compartment separately. Statistically, it is important to remember the following: Most masses (> 60%) are: In children t\\nhe most common (> 80%) are: In adults the most common are:\\nLocalize to the mediastinum:\\nLEFT: A lung mass abutts the mediastinal surface and creates acute angles with the lung.RIGHT: A mediastinal mass will sit under the surface of the mediastinum, creating obtuse angl\\nes with the lung. The following characteristics indicate that a lesion originates within the mediastinum: A lung mass abutts the mediastinal surface and creates acute angles with th\\ne lung, while a mediastinal mass will sit under the surface creating obtuse angles with the lung (Figure). On the left you see two different patients. Describe the findings and cont\\ninue. On the x-ray on the left there is a lesion that has an acute border with the mediastinum. This must be a lung mass. The chest radiograph on the right shows a lesion with an ob\\ntuse angle to the mediastinum. This must be a mediastinal mass. Since there is a silhouette-sign with the right heart border - which is located anteriorly - we can deduce that the m\\nass must be located within the anterior mediastinum. The lesion on the left was a pancoast tumor. The lesion on the right was a thymoma, located within the anterior mediastinum.\\nLocalize within the mediastinum:\\nThe mediastinum can be divided into anterior, middle and posterior compartments. It is important to remember that there is no tissue plane separating these compartments. On the late\\nral radiograph the anterior and middle compartments can be separated by drawing an imaginary line anterior to the trachea and posteriorly to the inferior vena cava. The middle and p\\nosterior compartments can be separated by an imaginary line passing 1 cm posteriorly to the anterior border of the vertebral bodies. This division allows us to make a more narrow di\\nfferential diagnosis. In many hospitals a CT will be made to further analyze and characterize anterior and middle mediastinal masses. An MRI is usually made to analyze masses locate\\nd in the posterior compartment because the majority of these masses turn out to be neurogenic in nature. An additional CT can be performed, when bone needs to be assessed.\\nAnterior Mediastinum:\\nThe anterior mediastinum contains the following structures: thymus, lymph nodes, ascending aorta, pulmonary artery, phrenic nerves and thyroid. The most common lesions that you will\\n see in the anterior mediastinum will either be of thymic or lymph node origin. Even the germ cell tumors arise from the pluripotent cells of the thymus. Before you want to biopsy a\\nn anterior mediastinal mass, do not forget thta some of these lesions can be vascular in origin. The four T's make up the mnemonic for anterior mediastinal masses:: On conventional \\nradiographs look for the signs listed in the table on the left. The finding of an obliterated retrosternal clear space is not so helpfull anymore, since nowadays many patients are o\\nbese. In these patients the retrosternal space can be filled with fat.\\nObliterated retrosternal clear space:\\nDescribe the images on the left. Then continue. On the PA film there is a lobulated widening of the superior mediastinum. On the lateral chest film the retrosternal clear space is o\\nbliterated. This happened to be a patient with lymphoma. On the left FDG-PET images of the same patient. There are multiple lymphatic masses in the anterior, middle and even posteri\\nor mediastinum, spreading to the neck. Hilum Overlay Sign: hilar vessels are seen through a mediastinal mass\\nHilum Overlay Sign:\\nWhen there is a mediastinal mass and you still can see the hilar vessels through this mass, then you know the mass does not arise from the hilum. This is known as the hilum overlay \\nsign. Because of the geometry of the mediastinum most of these masses will be located in the anterior mediastinum. Describe the images on the left. Then continue. On the chest film \\nthere is a mass that has obtuse angles with the mediastinum, so it is a mediastinal mass. The hilar vessels are seen through this mass, so it does not arise from the hilum and proba\\nbly will arise from the anterior mediastinum. The anterior location was confirmed on a CT. Most commonly this will be a mass of thymic or lymphatic origin. This proved to be a lymph\\noma in a HIV-positive patient.\\nCystic masses:\\nThe anterior mediastinum is an important location for cystic masses. Masses can be entirely cystic (thymic cysts) or have solid components (lymphoma or cystic thymoma). Some masses \\nare cystic with enhancing septations - in these cases you should think of a germ cell tumor. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. The CT shows an anterior mediastinal mass\\n with water density attenuation. This is typical for a thymic cyst. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. The CT shows a mass located in the anterior mediastinum. The mass \\nis cystic but has solid enhancing septa. This finding is very specific for a germ cell tumor. Now many think that germ cell tumors contain fat and if a lesion does not contain fat, \\nit cannot be a germ cell tumor. You have to remember, that only about 60 % of germ cell tumors contain fat, so you must realize that the absence of fat does not exclude a germ cell \\ntumor from the differential diagnosis. The more solid components a germ cell tumor has, the more likely the tumor is to be malignant. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. \\nThe CT shows a mass located in the anterior mediastinum. The mass is cystic but has solid enhancing components, so we are worried about lymphoma, germ cell tumor and cystic thymoma.\\n This proved to be a cystic thymoma.\\nMiddle Mediastinum:\\nThe middle mediastinum contains the following structures: lymph nodes, trachea, esophagus, azygos vein, vena cavae, posterior heart and the aortic arch. The majority of middle media\\nstinal masses will consist of foregut duplication cysts (eg oesophageal duplication or bronchogenic cysts) or lymphadenopathy. Aortic arch anomalies can also present as middle media\\nstinal masses. Fluid containing lesions are usually duplication cysts or necrotic lymph nodes. A pancreatic fluid collection due to pancreatitis may also present as a mediastinal ma\\nss. A fibrovascular esophageal polyp is a mesenchymal lesion which almost always contains fat. Vascular lesions are arch anomalies, azygos continuation due to interrupted inferior v\\nena cava or hyperenhancing lymph nodes. On conventional radiographs look for the signs listed in the table on the left. Displaced azygoesophageal recess wiil be seen on the right. O\\nn the left you may have a pseudoparavertebral line. This is a new interface that looks like a paravertebral line. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. On the AP chest radi\\nograph of this patient there is widening of the azygoesophageal recess on the right. There is an apparent widening of the paravertebral line on the left. On the lateral film the mas\\ns is anterior to the spine and therefore is located in the middle mediastinal. On the CT the azygoesophageal recess is displaced to the right due to oesophageal varices (blue arrow)\\n and there is also a new interface on the left. This is a patient with cirrhosis of the liver and varices as a result of portal hypertension. On the left a patient with a small cell\\n lung carcinoma. Describe the images on the left. Then continue. On the PA film there is a lobulated paratracheal stripe on the right. On the lateral radiograph there is a density o\\nverlying the ascending aorta and filling the retrosternal space. These findings indicate a mass in the anterior aswell as in the middle mediastinum. The CT confirms the presence oof\\n lymphomas in both the anterior and the middle mediastinum. On the left two different patients. One of these patients has pulmonary hypertension and the other has sarcoidosis. Descr\\nibe the images on the left. Then continue. On the right image there is a lobulated mass surrounding the right bronchus creating a 'doughnut' with the bronchus as the hole in the dou\\nghnut. On the left image there is only density in the area from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock and not in the 3 - 9 o'clock area. So the patient on the left has pulmonary hypertension with \\nmoderately enlarged vessels while the patient on the right has sarcoidosis with widespread lymphadenopathy. When there is a density in the 3 - 9 o'clock area, there should always be\\n concern about mediastinal masses.\\nPosterior Mediastinum:\\nThe posterior mediastinum contains the following structures: sympathetic ganglia, nerve roots, lymph nodes, parasympathetic chain, thoracic duct, descending thoracic aorta, small ve\\nssels and the vertebrae. Most masses in the posterior mediastinum are neurogenic in nature. These can arise from the sympathetic ganglia (eg neuroblastoma) or from the nerve roots (\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 137}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"eg schwannoma or neurofibroma). Don't forget lymphadenopathy, the vertebrae and the descending thoracic aorta as potential causes for posterior mediastinal masses. Cystic lesions wi\\nll be either neuroenteric cysts, schwannomas or meningoceles. Fat containing lesions will be extramedullary hematopoiesis. When the anemia is resolved the extramedullary marrow will\\n stop producing blood and become fatty. On conventional radiographs look for:\\nCervicothoracic sign:\\nThe anterior mediastinum stops at the level of the superior clavicle. Therefore, when a mass extends above the superior clavicle, it is located either in the neck or in the posterio\\nr mediastinum. When lung tissue comes between the mass and the neck, the mass is probably in the posterior mediastinum. This is known as the Cervicothoracic Sign. If we study the im\\nage on the frontal view on the left, we see a mass extending above the level of the clavicle and there is lung tissue in front of it, so this must be a mass in the posterior mediast\\ninum. On the left the MR of the same patient. It turned out to be a schwannoma. On the left images of a patient, who has a disease, that is the most commonly missed diagnosis in the\\n emergency department resulting in the number one cause of law suits. Study the images and then continue. Notice the widening of the paravertebral stripes on both the left and the r\\night on the PA radiograph. On the lateral radiograph there is a severely narrowed disc space. The diagnosis is discitis. On MR you will notice the edema of the soft tissues and the \\nhigh signal intensity of the disc.\\nMore than one compartment:\\nSince there are no tissue planes separating the mediastinal compartments, there are lesions that do not respect our approach to the mediastinum. These lesions tend to occupy more th\\nan one compartment and include: mediastinitis, hematomas, vascular entities, bronchogenic cancer, metastases and lymphangiomas (fluid containing).\\nCharacterize:\\nOnce you have localized a mediastinal mass, next try to charcterize it by assessing whether it has any of the following characteristics:\\nFluid containing masses:\\nThis is a list of mediastinal msses that may contain fluid: If a mass contains fluid it could be a teratoma (on the left) or a thymic cyst (on the right). Note that this teratoma do\\nes not contain fat. Teratomas are the most common benign germ cell tumors. The most common malignant germ cell tumor is the seminoma. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. \\nThere is are multiple masses in both the anterior and middle mediastinum. The attenuation values are of water density. These findings favor the diagnosis of cystic lymphadenopathy i\\nn a patient with metastatic disease. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. There is a cystic lesion in the middle mediastinum. There is a fluid fluid level with milk of cal\\ncium. Foregut duplication cysts occasionally contain milk of calcium like in this example of an esophageal duplication cyst.\\nFat containing masses:\\nThe differential diagnosis of fat containing mediastinal masses is: On the left we see an fat-containing anterior mediastinal mass. This is the typical finding of a fat-containing t\\neratoma. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. The axial CT and sagittal MR demonstrate a lipomatous lesion within the lumen of the esophagus. This is typical for a esophag\\neal lipoma and its fibrovascular stalk.

Lung abnormalities with an increas\\ned density - also called opacities - are the most common. A practical approach is to divide these into four patterns: In this article we will focus on this four-pattern approach. At\\n the end we will also discuss diseases that present as areas of decreased density.\\n4-Pattern approach:\\nWhenever you see an area of increased density within the lung, it must be the result of one of these four patterns. Here are the most common examples of these four patterns on a che\\nst x-ray (click image to enlarge). Consolidation Interstitial Reticular interstitial opacities You have to realize that it is not always possible to divide lung abnormalities into o\\nne of these four patterns, but that should not be a problem. Sometimes you are confronted with an abnormality that looks like a mass, but it could also be a consolidation. Just do t\\nhe work-up of both the differential diagnosis of masses and consolidation. In such a case information from clinical data, old films or follow-up films and CT-scan will usually solve\\n the problem. Finally in some cases only biopsy will provide a diagnosis.\\nConsolidation:\\nConsolidation is the result of replacement of air in the alveoli by transudate, pus, blood, cells or other substances. Pneumonia is by far the most common cause of consolidation. Th\\ne disease usually starts within the alveoli and spreads from one alveolus to another. When it reaches a fissure the spread stops there. The key-findings on the X-ray are: Chronic di\\nseases are indicated in red.\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\nThe table summarizes the most common diseases, that present with consolidation. Click to enlarge. Chronic diseases are indicated in red. A way to think of the differential diagnosis\\n is to think of the possible content of the alveoli: Another way to think of consolidation, is to look at the pattern of distribution: Now it is obvious that some diseases can have \\nmore than one pattern. For instance a lobar pneumonia caused by streptococcus pneumoniae may become diffuse if the patient does not respond to the treatment. Other examples are orga\\nnizing pneumonia (OP) and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. These diseases typically present as multifocal consolidations, but sometimes they may become diffuse. OP is organizing pneu\\nmonia. When it is idiopathic it is called cryptogenic (COP). The old name is BOOP - Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia. The new name for BAC - bronchoalveolar carcinoma i\\ns adenocarcinoma in situ. It is very important to differentiate between acute consolidation and chronic consolidation, because it will limit the differential diagnosis. In chronic d\\nisease we think of: This is known as alveolar sarcoidosis.\\n* Alveolar proteinosis is a rare chronic disease that is characterized by filling of the alveoli with proteinaceous material.\\nLobar consolidation:\\nThe most common presentation of consolidation is lobar or segmental. The most common diagnosis is lobar pneumonia. The table lists the differential diagnosis. Lobar pneumonia Here a\\n typical lobar consolidation. First study the images, then continue reading. The findings are: Lobar consolidation is the result of disease that starts in the periphery and spreads \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 138}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"from one alveolus to another through the pores of Kohn. At the borders of the disease some alveoli will be involved, while others are not, thus creating ill-defined borders. As the \\ndisease reaches a fissure, this will result in a sharp delineation, since consolidation will not cross a fissure. As the alveoli that surround the bronchi become more dense, the bro\\nnchi will become more visible, resulting in an air-bronchogram (arrow). In consolidation there should be no or only minimal volume loss, which differentiates consolidation from atel\\nectasis. Expansion of a consolidated lobe is not so common and is seen in Klebsiella pneumoniae and sometimes in Streptococcus pneumoniae, TB and lung cancer with obstructive pneumo\\nnia. Lobar pneumonia Lobar pneumonia On the chest x-ray there is an ill-defined area of increased density in the right upper lobe without volume loss. The right hilus is in a normal\\n position. Notice the air-bronchogram (arrow). In the proper clinical setting this is most likely a lobar or segmental pneumonia. However if this patient had weight loss or long sta\\nnding symptoms, we would include the list of causes of chronic consolidation. This was an acute lobar pneumonia caused by Streptcoccus pneumoniae. Based on the images alone, it is u\\nsually not possible to determine the cause of the consolidation. Other things need to be considered, like acute or chronic illness, clinical data and other non-pulmonary findings. H\\nere we have a number of x-rays with consolidation. Notice the similarity between these chest x-rays. Hemorrhage post-biopsy Hemorrhage In this case there was a solitary nodule in th\\ne right upper lobe and a biopsy was performed. The lobar consolidation is the result of hemorrhage as a complication of the procedure. Hemorrhage is seen in: Lunginfarction due to p\\nulmonary emboli Lung infarction The radiographic features of acute pulmonary thromboembolism are insensitive and nonspecific. The most common radiographic findings in the Prospectiv\\ne Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) study were atelectasis and patchy pulmonary opacity. In most cases of pulmonary emboli the chest x-ray is normal. This patie\\nnt had pulmonary emboli, which were seen on a CECT. The peripheral consolidation is seen in the region of the emboli and can be attributed to hemorrhage in the infarcted area. Pulmo\\nnary sequestration Pulmonary sequestration This is an uncommon cause of lobar consolidation. It is a congenital abnormality. A nonfunctioning part of the lung lacks communication wi\\nth the bronchial tree and receives arterial blood supply from the systemic circulation. Patients present with recurrent infection when bacteria migrate through the pores of Kohn. No\\ntice the feeding artery, that branches off from the aorta (blue arrow).\\nDiffuse consolidation:\\nThe most common cause of diffuse consolidation is pulmonary edema due to heart failure. This is also called cardiogenic edema, to differentiate it from the various causes of non-car\\ndiogenic edema. The increased heart size is usually what distinguishes between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic. Look for other signs of heart failure like redistribution of pulmonar\\ny blood flow, Kerley B-lines and pleural fluid. However some patients, who have an acute cardiac infarction, may still have a normal heart size, while other patients who have a larg\\ne heart due to a chronic heart disease, may have non-cardiac pulmonary edema due to a superimposed pulmonay infection, ARDS, near-drowning etc. Heart failure with diffuse perihilar \\npulmonary edema Congestive heart failure First study the images, then continue reading. The findings are: All these findings indicate, that we are dealing with pulmonary edema due t\\no heart failure. You probably would like to look at old films to see if there are any changes. Bilateral legionella pneumonia Diffuse consolidation in bronchopneumonia Here another \\ncase of diffuse consolidation. This patient had fever and cough. This was thought to be a diffuse bronchopneumonia. Unlike lobar pneumonia, which starts in the alveoli, bronchopneum\\nonia starts in the airways as acute bronchitis. It will lead to multifocal ill-defined densities. When it progresses it can produce diffuse consolidation. The disease does not cross\\n the fissures, but usually starts in multiple segments. Bronchopneumonia can be caused by many micro-organisms. This proved to be legionella pneumonia. Diffuse consolidation in a pa\\ntient with bronchoalveolar carcinoma Diffuse consolidation in bronchoalveolar carcinoma The chest x-ray shows diffuse consolidation with 'white out' of the left lung with an air-bro\\nnchogram. This patient had a chronic disease with progressive consolidation. The disease started as a persitent consolidation in the left lung and finally spread to the right lung. \\nFinal diagnosis: bronchoalveolar carcinoma. This is a difficult case. It demonstrates, that based on the x-ray alone, it is not certain which pattern we are looking at. Are these de\\nnsities masses or consolidation? Continue with the CT. Non Hodgkin lymphoma The CT-image is not very helpful in the differentiation. There are hypodense areas, which could be masses\\n. On the other hand this also could be areas of consolidation with hypodense areas due to necrosis. Finally the diagnosis non Hodgkin's disease was made based on biopsy. BatwingA bi\\nlateral perihilar distribution of consolidation is also called a Batwing distribution. The sparing of the periphery of the lung is attributed to a better lymphatic drainage in this \\narea. It is most typical of pulmonary edema, both cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic. Sometimes it is seen in pneumonias. Reverse BatwingPeripheral or subpleural consolidation is calle\\nd reverse Batwing distribution. It is frequently seen in chronic lung disease.\\nMultifocal:\\nMultifocal consolidations are also described as multifocal ill-defined opacities or densities. In most cases these are the result of airspace-consolidations due to bronchopneumonia.\\n As mentioned before bronchopneumonia starts in the bronchi and then spreads into the lungparenchyma. This can lead to segmental, diffuse or multifocal ill-defined densities. In som\\ne cases however the underlying pathology of multiple ill-defined densities is interstitial disease, like in the alveolar form of sarcoidosis in which the granulomas are very small a\\nnd fill up the alveoli. First study the chest x-ray. What are the findings and what is the differential diagnosis? Notice that there are multiple densities in both lungs. The larger\\n ones are ill-defined and maybe there is an air-bronchogram in the right lower lobe. Probably we are dealing with multifocal consolidations, but one might also consider the possibil\\nity of multiple ill-defined masses. There is a peripheral distribution. This patient had a several month history of chronic non-productive cough, that did not respond to antibiotics\\n. So we are dealing with the differential diagnosis of chronic consolidation. The lab-findings were normal which makes bronchoalveolar carcinoma and lymphoma less likely. There was \\nno eosinophilia, which excludes eosinophilic pneumonia. Biopsy revealed the diagnosis of organizing pneumonia (OP) also known as BOOP. Wegener's granulomatosis Wegener's is a collag\\nen vascular disease with vasculitis involving the lung, kidney and sinuses. In the lung the vasculitis causes infarcts which first present as ill-defined areas of consolidation. In \\na later stage these infarcts become more circumscribed and can be seen as multiple nodules or masses, sometimes with cavitation. Here a patient with non-specific findings. There are\\n ill-defined densities in the right lung, which proved to be a manifestation of Wegener's.\\nInterstitial disease:\\nDifferential diagnosis on HRCT:\\nMost of our knowledge about imaging findings in interstitial lung disease comes from HRCT. On HRCT there are four patterns: reticular, nodular, high and low attenuation (table). On \\na Chest X-Ray it can be very difficult to determine whether there is interstitial lung disease and what kind of pattern we are dealing with. On a CXR the most common pattern is reti\\ncular. The ground-glass pattern is frequently not detected on a chest x-ray. The cystic pattern is also difficult to appreciate on a cest x-ray. When the cysts have thick walls like\\n in Langerhans cell histiocytosis or honeycombing, it frequently presents as a reticular pattern on a CXR. However sometimes an interstitial pattern can be seen and in many cases UI\\nP can be suspected based on the x-ray findings. Cystic versus Reticular It can be difficult to determine whether we are dealing with a reticular pattern or a cystic pattern. The CXR\\n is of a patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is called a cystic disease. On the CXR it is difficult to see if this is a cystic or a reticular pattern. In many of s\\nuch cases a HRCT will give you more information. This problem is also seen in patients with UIP. One of the prominent findings in UIP is honeycombing. This creates a reticular patte\\nrn on the chest x-ray, because the cysts in honeycombing have thick walls. We will show a case in a moment. Reticular pattern in Congestive heart failure Study the images and then c\\nontinue reading. The findings are: Based on these findings we can conclude that we are dealing with congestive heart failure. This is the most common interstitial pattern on a CXR. \\nInterstitial edema usually presents as reticulation. Sometimes Kerley B lines are visible. Here another example. Kerley B lines are 1-2 cm long horizontal lines near the lateral ple\\nura. The main differential diagnosis of Kerley B lines is: Here another chest x-ray with interstitial edema and Kerley B lines in a patient with congestive heart failure. The CT sho\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 139}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"ws the septal thickening. Sometimes the reticulation is more coarse like in this case of congestive heart failure. Sarcoidosis In this case the chest x-ray shows subtle findings tha\\nt could be described as fine reticulation. In many cases a HRCT is needed to determine the exact nature of the findings. The HRCT - not shown - demonstrated a fine nodular appearanc\\ne as a result of sarcoidosis. Notice the subtle irregular thickening of the minor fissure. This is quite specific for sarcoidosis. Longstanding Sarcoidosis Here a typical chest film\\n in a patient with long standing Sarcoidosis (stage IV). There is fibrosis in the upper zones. The differential diagnosis includes chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which also r\\nesults in fibrosis with upper lobe predominance. The HRCT demonstrates densities in both upper lobes. These are called conglomerate masses, which are the result of conglomerates of \\nnodules. Here another patient with sarcoidosis. The is volume loss in the upper lobes as a result of fibrosis. The image on the left also shows densities in the lung. On a HRCT fine\\n nodules were seen. A follow-up CXR shows resorption of most of the lung abnormalities. The fibrosis persists.\\nUIP:\\nUIP is a histologic pattern of pulmonary fibrosis. On a chest X-ray UIP manifests as a reticular pattern particularly at the lung bases. In many cases you can suspect UIP on the CXR\\n. A HRCT is needed to confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating honeycombing. Here a CXR with a reticular pattern at the lung bases. This pattern was first attributed to chronic conges\\ntive heart failure, but persisted on follow-up CXR's despite therapy. HRCT demonstrated honeycombing. Here another case. The CXR demonstrates a reticular interstitial pattern with a\\n preference at the lung bases. The HRCT demonstrates honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. PCP\\nInterstitial pneumonias:\\nAn acute reticular pattern is most frequently caused by interstitial edema due to cardiac heart failure. The other cause is interstitial pneumonia: This patient presented with a non\\nproductive cough and some fever. This was a PCP-infection as a first manifestation of AIDS. Sarcoidosis On a CXR sarcoidosis usually first presents with hilar and mediastinal lympha\\ndenopathy (example). Parenchymal disease can present as consolidation or even as masses, but the most common presentation is a fine nodules. Here a typical case. When these small no\\ndules coalesce, they may resemble consolidation. Lymphangitis carcinomatosis Lymphangitis carcinomatosis also produces a reticular pattern. It is best appreciated on HRCT-images.\\nAtelectasis:\\nAtelectasis or lung-collapse is the result of loss of air in a lung or part of the lung with subsequent volume loss due to airway obstruction or compression of the lung by pleural f\\nluid or a pneumothorax. In many cases atelectasis is the first sign of a lung cancer. Evidently it is very important to recognize the various presentations of atelectasis, since som\\ne of them can be easily misinterpretated. The key-findings on the X-ray are:\\nLobar atelectasis:\\nLobar atelectasis or lobar collaps is an important finding on a chest x-ray and has a limited differential diagnosis. The most common causes of atelectasis are: Sometimes lobar atel\\nectasis produces only mild volume loss due to overinflation of the other lungparts. The illustration summarizes the findings of the different types of lobar atelectasis. Right upper\\n lobe atelectasis First study the images, then continue reading. Findings: On the PET-CT a lungneoplasm is seen with subsequent atelectasis of the right upper lobe due to obstructio\\nn of the upper lobe bronchus. A common finding in atelectasis of the right upper lobe is 'tenting' of the diafphragm (blue arrow). This patient had a centrally located lungcarcinoma\\n with metastases in both lungs (red arrows). Right middle lobe atelectasis First study the x-rays and then continue reading. What are the findings? Usually right middle lobe atelect\\nasis does not result in noticable elevation of the right diaphragm. A pectus excavatum can mimick a middle lobe atelectasis on a frontal view, but the lateral view should solve this\\n problem. Right lower lobe atelectasis Chest x-rays of a 70-year old male who fell from the stairs and has severe pain on the right flank. There is some loculated pleural fluid post\\nerolateral as a result of hematothorax. What are the pulmonary findings? First study the images, then continue reading. LEFT: Lower lobe atelectasis. RIGHT: Follow up. There is a ri\\nght lower lobe atelectasis. Notice the abnormal right border of the heart. The right interlobar artery is not visible, because it is not surrounded by aerated lung but by the collap\\nsed lower lobe, which is adjacent to the right atrium. On a follow-up chest film the atelectasis has resolved. We assume that the atelectasis was a result of post-traumatic poor ven\\ntilation with mucus plugging. Notice the reappearance of the right interlobar artery (red arrow) and the normal right heart border (blue arrow). Left upper lobe atelectasis First st\\nudy the x-rays, then continue reading. What are the findings? The CT-images demonstrate the atelectasis of the left upper lobe (blue arrow). There is a centrally located mass which \\nobstructs the left upper lobe bronchus (red arrow). First study the x-rays then continue reading. What are the findings and what sign is seen here? There is an atelectasis of the le\\nft upper lobe. You would not expect the apical region to be this dark, but in fact this is caused by overinflation of the lower lobe, which causes the superior segment to creep all \\nthe way up to the apical region. This is called the luft sichel sign. First study the x-rays, then continue reading. The findings are: These findings indicate a total atelectasis of\\n the left upper lobe and possibly also partial atelectasis on the right. Since the silhouette of the right heart border is still visible, there is probably partial atelectasis of th\\ne lower lobe and not of the middle lobe. Continue with the PET-CT... Lungcarcinoma on the left obstructing the upper lobe bronchus and also a lung carcinoma on the right obstructing\\n the right lower lobe. On the PET-CT there is both a tumor in the left lung, aswell as in the right. There were mutiple bone metastases. One rib metastasis is indicated by the arrow\\n. Luft sichel means a sickle of air (blue arrow). Notice the bulging of the fissure on the lateral view. This is comparable to the golden-S sign in right upper lobe atelectasis and \\nis suspective of a centrally obstructing mass. Study the images and then continue reading. There is a total collaps of the left upper lobe. Notice the high position of the left hilu\\nm. There is only a subtle band of density projecting behind the sternum. This is the collapsed upper lobe. In this case there is compensatory overinflation of the left lower lobe re\\nsulting in a normal position of the diaphragm and the mediastinum. Left lower lobe atelectasis First study the x-rays then continue reading. Where is the abnormality located? There \\nis a triangular density seen through the cardiac shadow. This must be an abnormality located posterior to the heart. This is confirmed on the lateral view. The contour of the left d\\niaphragm is lost when you go from anterior to posterior. As the title suggests this is lower lobe atelectasis. We cannot see the lower lobe vessels, because they are surrounded by t\\nhe atelectatic lobe. Normally when you follow the thoracic spine form top to bottom, the lower region becomes less opaque. Here we have the opposite (blue arrow). Total atelectasis \\nThe chest x-ray shows total atelectasis of the right lung due to mucus plugging. Notice the displacement of the mediastinum to the right. Re-aeration on follow-up chest film after t\\nreatment with a suction catheter. The mediastinum has regained its normal position. A common cause of total atelectasis of a lung is a ventilation tube that is positioned too deep a\\nnd thus obstructing one of the main bronchi. Total atelectasis in a patient with severe bronchopneumonia. These images are of a patient who had widespread bronchopneumonia and was o\\nn ventilation. During follow up a white out on the left was seen. This was caused by a large mucus plug. After suction of the mucus plug the left lung was re-aerated. The chest x-ra\\ny shows a nearly total opacification of the left hemithorax. This patient was known to have pleuritic carcinomatosis. The left lung is almost completely compressed by the pleural fl\\nuid. Unlike most of the above cases, which were caused by obstruction, in this case the atelectasis is a result of compression. The compression of the lung by the loculated fluid co\\nllections is best seen on the CT-image (blue arrow). The CT-scan was performed, because the patient was suspected of having pulmonary emboli (red arrow).\\nRounded atelectasis:\\nThe typical findings of rounded atelectasis on CT are pleural thickening, pleural-based mass and comet tail sign. The theory is that a local pleuritis causes the pleura to thicken a\\nnd contract. The underlying lung shrinks and atelectasis develops in a round configuration. The distorted vessels appear to be pulled into the mass and resemble a comet tail (4). Fi\\nrst study the images and then continue reading. On the lateral view there is a mass-like lesion that is pleural-based. The first impresson is, that this is a pleural lesion. A CT wa\\ns performed - see next images. Rounded atelectasis The CT shows a lesion that originates in the lung. Many would have a lungcancer on the top of their differential diagnostic list. \\nHowever there is also some pleural thickening (red arrow) and vessels seem to swirl around the mass (blue arrows). This is also described as the comet tail sign (4). Whenever you se\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 140}),\n",

Rounded atelectasis is a benign lesion and when the findings are convinc\\ning, then biopsy is not needed. During follow up these lesions usually do not change in configuration. Rounded atelectasis is frequently seen in patients with a history of asbest ex\\nposure. The images show a density posteriorly in the left lower lobe. On the PA-film this looks like a mass or possibly a consolidation. On the lateral film however the boundaries s\\neem to be sharp, which is in favor of a mass. Also notice that the pleura is thickened (red arrow). Although a peripheral lungcancer is on top of our list, we now also consider the \\npossibility of rounded atelectasis. Rounded atelectasis The CT-images show the typical features of a rounded atelectasis. There is an oval mass, pleural thickening and a comet tail \\nsign (arrow). This lesion did not change in a two-year follow up. Plate-like atelectasis due to poor inspiration in a patient who had abdominal surgery Plate-like atelectasis Plate-\\nlike atelectasis is a common finding on chest x-rays and detected almost every day. They are characterized by linear shadows of increased density at the lung bases. They are usually\\n horizontal, measure 1-3 mm in thickness and are only a few cm long. In most cases these findings have no clinical significance and are seen in smokers and elderly. They are seen in\\n patients, that are in a poor condition and who breathe superficially, for instance after abdominal surgery (figure). Plate-like atelectasis in a patient with pulmonary embolism Pla\\nte-like atelectasis is frequently seen in patients in the ICU due to poor ventilation. Platelike atelectasis is also frequently seen in pulmonary embolism, but since it is non-speci\\nfic, it is not a helpful sign in making the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Cicacitration atelectasis Atelectasis can be the result of fibrosis of lungtissue. This is seen after ra\\ndiotherapy and in chronic infection, especially TB. Here we have a patient who was treated with radiotherapy for lungcancer. Notice the increased density of the lung tissue and the \\nvolume loss. Here we have a patient with atelectasis of the right upper lobe as a result of TB. Notice the deviation of the trachea. There is also some atelectasis of the left upper\\n lobe, which results in a high position of the left pulmonary artery as seen on the lateral view (red arrow)\\nNodules and Masses:\\nSolitary Pulmonary Nodule:\\nClick here for more detailed information about Solitary Pulmonary Nodule A solitary pulmonary nodule or SPN is defined as a discrete, well-marginated, rounded opacity less than or e\\nqual to 3 cm in diameter. It has to be completely surrounded by lung parenchyma, does not touch the hilum or mediastinum and is not associated with adenopathy, atelectasis or pleura\\nl effusion. The differential diagnosis of SPN is basically the same as of a mass except that the chance of malignancy increases with the size of the lesion. Lesions smaller than 3 c\\nm, i.e. SPN's are most commonly benign granulomas, while lesions larger than 3 cm are treated as malignancies until proven otherwise and are called masses. The tabel is adapted from\\n chest x-ray - a survival guide. In lesions that do not respond to antibiotics, probably the most important non-invasive diagnostic tool is nowadays the PET-CT. PET-CT can detect ma\\nlignancy in focal pulmonary lesions of greater than 1 cm with a sensitivity of about 97% and a specificity of 78%. False-positive findings in the lung are seen in granulomatous dise\\nase and rheumatoid disease. False negatives are seen in low grade malignant tumors like carcinoid and alveolar cell carcinoma and lesions of less than 1 cm. Click to enlarge the tab\\nle\\nFleischner Society recommendations for follow-up of nodules:\\nPrevious chest radiographs should be reviewed to determine if the lesion has been stable over 2 years. If so, no further follow up is necessary, with the exception of pure ground-gl\\nass lesions on CT scans, which can be slower growing. For lesions with a benign pattern of calcification, further testing is not necessary. Management of indeterminate lesions great\\ner than 8-10 mm depends on clinical probability of malignancy, as follows: Any unequivocal growth noted during follow up means that a definitive tissue diagnosis is needed.\\nMultiple masses:\\nThe differential diagnostic list of multiple masses is very long. The most important diagnoses are listed in the table. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate multifocal consoli\\ndations from masses. Metastases Metastases are the most common cause of multiple pulmonary masses. Usually they vary in size and are well-defined. They predominate in the lower lobe\\ns and in the subpleural region. HRCT will demonstrate the random distribution unlike other diseases that have a perilymphatic or centrilobular distribution. The images show a renal \\ncell carcinoma that has invaded the inferior vena cava with subsequent spread of disease to the lungs. Metastases in a patient with a head-neck cancer Here another patient with wide\\nspread pulmonary metastases of a cancer, that was located in the tongue. Mucoid impaction\\nMucoid impaction:\\nMucus plugs or mucoid impaction can mimick the appearance of lung nodules or a mass. Sometimes differentiating mucus impaction from a lungcancer can be difficult. Mucoid impaction i\\ns commonly seen in patients with bronchiectasis, as in cystic fibrosis (CF) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ABPA is a hypersensitivity disorder induced by Asperg\\nillus, that occurs in patients with asthma or CF. It is also seen in bronchial obstruction caused by an obstructing tumor or bronchial atresia. In this case there are some mass-like\\n structures in the right lung. CT demonstrated bronchiectasis with mucoid impaction. A more common presentation of mucoid impaction in seen here. This is the typical 'finger-in-glov\\ne' appearance of mucoid impaction. The mucus in the dilated bronchi looks like the fingers in a glove. Bronchial atresia Bronchial atresia Bronchial atresia is a congenital abnormal\\nity resulting from interruption of a bronchus with associated peripheral mucus impaction and associated hyperinflation of the obstructed lung (10). The hyperinflation of the affecte\\nd lungsegment is caused by collateral ventilation through the pores of Kohn. The characteristic finding is a hyperlucent area of the lung surrounding a branching or nodular opacity \\nthat extends from the hilum. Notice the central mass surrounded by hyperlucent lung (blue arrow).\\nDecreased density or lucencies:\\nRadiologists use many terms to describe areas of decreased density or lucencies within the lung, like cyst, cavity, pneumatocele, emphysema, bulla, honeycombing, bleb etc. Many of t\\nhese terms are based on the pathogenesis of the abnormality. This makes it difficult to use these terms, since in many cases when we describe a chest X-ray, we are trying to figger \\nout what the pathology could be. A more practical approach is to describe areas of decreased density in the lung as: Cavities frequently arise within a mass or an area of consolidat\\nion as a result of necrosis. We will discuss them here, because the prominent feature is the lucency. In the differential diagnosis there is overlap between cavities and cysts. Cavi\\nties can heal and end up as lungcysts and lungcysts can become infected and turn into thick walled cavities. Sometimes emphysematous bullae have visible walls that measure less than\\n 1 mm. To differentiate them from cysts, is to look at the surrounding lung parenchyma. Cysts occur without associated pulmonary emphysema. Cysts usually contain air, but occasional\\nly contain fluid or solid material. The term is mostly used to describe enlarged thin-walled airspaces in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis or Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Th\\nicker-walled honeycomb cysts are seen in patients with end-stage fibrosis (11). Pneumonia with cavitation\\nCavitation:\\nPneumonia In virulent pyogenic infections an abscess may form within the consolidated lung as a result of necrosis due to vasculitis and thrombosis. When some of the pus is coughed \\nup, a cavity can be seen on the chest film. These patients are usually very ill. In granulomatous infection like TB, cavities may form, but these patients are usually not that ill. \\nCavitation is not seen in viral pneumonia, mycoplasma and rarely in streptococcus pneumoniae. These images are of a young patient with pneumonia. No micro-organism could be isolated\\n. Within one month after treatment with antibiotics, there was almost complete resolution of the consolidation and the cavity. Pneumonia with cavitation. Minimal changes at follow u\\np. Pneumonia Here another example of a pneumonia with cavitation. Notice the destruction of lung parenchyma as seen on the CT. At one year follow up only minimal changes are seen on\\n the CXR.

Septic emboli Septic emboli usually present as multiple ill-defi\\nned nodules. In about 50% cavitation is seen. CT demonstrates more lesions than the chest film and can suggest the diagnosis in the proper clinical setting by demonstrating wegde-sh\\naped peripheral lesions abutting the pleura, air-bronchograms within the ill-defined nodules and a feeding vessel sign (7). Some argue whether there is really something like a feedi\\nng vessel sign (8). Here a patient with septic emboli.

Individu\\nal myocardial segments can be assigned to the 3 major coronary arteries with the recognition that there is anatomic variability. 17 segments model (2) basal anterolateral mid anteri\\nor mid anterolateral apical anterior apical lateral apex Click for larger version\\nEnhancement patterns:\\nAdministration of Gadolinium results in uptake of the contrast agent into both normal and injured myocardium. In normal myocardium there will be early wash out of contrast. In injur\\ned myocardium the wash out is very slow resulting in delayed enhancement after 10 - 15 minutes compared to the normal myocardium. Delayed enhancement of myocardial tissue is seen in\\n many pathophysiologic scenarios: LEFT: Long axis late enhancement image in a patient with an inferior wall infarction with subendocardial enhancement in the territory of the right \\ncoronary artery RIGHT: 4-chamber late enhancement image in a patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with midmyocardial enhancement\\nIschemic versus non-ischemic:\\nThe causes of cardiomyopathy (CM) can be divided into ischemic and non-ischemic (1-5). Ischemic CM\\n is defined as dysfunction of the left ventricle as a result of a chronic lack of oxygen due to coronary artery disease. Delayed enhancement MR images will show fibrosis, which appe\\nars as high signal intensity in an area of coronary artery distribution. Since all infarctions start subendocardially and may progress to transmural, the subendocardial region is al\\nways involved. Non-ischemic CM \\n has a variable etiology, i.e. genetic, toxic, metabolic, infectious and idiopathic. In nonischemic myocardial disease the delayed enhancement usually does not occur in a coronary a\\nrtery distribution and is often midwall or epicardial rather than subendocardial or transmural.\\nIschemic Cardiomyopathy:\\nLeft: subendocardial infarction, Right: transmural infarction\\nInfarction and delayed enhancement:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 142}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Infarcted myocardium is bright on late-enhancement images. All patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy demonstrate delayed enhancement in a typical 'CAD' pattern, one in which the sub\\nendocardium is always involved. When a coronary artery is occluded the infarction always starts subendocardially and progresses towards the epicardium depending on the duration of t\\nhe occlusion [6]. Both acute and chronic infarctions enhance. In acute infarctions the contrast enters the damaged myocardial cells due to myocyte membrane disruption. In chronic in\\nfarctions the late enhancement is a result of retention of contrast material in the large interstitial space between the collagen fibers in the fibrotic tissue [7]. Left: no-reflow \\nphenomenonRight: four months later there is transmural enhancement indicating a transmural infarction\\nNo reflow phenomenon:\\nNo reflow phenomenon is the failure of blood to reperfuse an ischemic area after the physical obstruction has been removed or bypassed. No reflow zones are identified on late-enhanc\\nement images as a dark core surrounded by an enhancing rim. This finding indicates the presence of damaged microvasculature in the core of an area of infarction The presence of a 'n\\no reflow' zone is associated with worse functional outcome, larger infarcts and adverse clinical outcome [8,9]. Both acute and chronic infarctions demonstrate delayed-enhancement, b\\nut an acute infarction can often be distinguished by the presence of a 'no reflow' zone and high signal on T2 weighted images.\\nStunning:\\nCine imaging in combination with delayed-enhancement MR allows identification of: Stunning is defined as postischemic myocardial dysfunction that persists despite restoration of nor\\nmal blood flow. Over time there can be a gradual return of contractile function depending on the transmurality of the ischemia [10]. If the degree of transmurality as seen on the de\\nlayed enhancement images is less than 50%, the myocardial function is likely to recover [11]. On the left a long axis cine 6 days after revascularization of an acute inferior wall i\\nnfarction. First study the video and then continue reading. Continue with the delayed enhancement image. Long axis late enhancement image 6 days after revascularized acute inferior \\nwall infarction On the left the long axis delayed enhancement image of the same patient. There is less than 50% enhancement of the myocardium. This is a good prognostic sign and we \\ncan expect a restoration of some of the contractile function. Continue with the cine-view four months later. On the left the same patient four months after the inferior infarction a\\nnd revascularization. First study the video and then continue reading. The long axis cine shows improved function of the inferior wall. Now it can be concluded that the hypokinesia \\nwas due to stunning. Myocardial regions that demonstrate little or no evidence of hyperenhancement (i.e. infarction) have a high likelihood of recovery, whereas regions with transmu\\nral hyperenhancement have virtually no chance of recovery.\\nHibernation:\\nHibernation is a state in which some segments of the myocardium exhibit abnormalities of contractile function at rest [10]. This phenomenon is highly significant clinically because \\nit usually manifests itself in the setting of chronic ischemia, that is potentially reversible by revascularization.\\nThe reduced coronary blood flow causes the myocytes to enter a low-energy 'sleep mode' to conserve energy. There is an inverse relationship between the transmural extent of hyperenh\\nancement, and the likelihood of wall motion recovery following revascularization. If the transmural extent of late enhancement is less than 50% the function is likely to improve aft\\ner revascularization [12]. On the left long axis cine-images of a patient with a severe stenosis of the LAD. First study the video and then continue reading. The cine images show: C\\nontinue with the late enhancement image. Hibernation of the anterior wall (blue arrow) and old transmural inferior wall infarction (yellow arrow). On the left the long axis late enh\\nancement image in the same patient. Noice the following: So it can be concluded, that this is probably the result of hibernation. After PTCA there is improvement of the function of \\nthe anterior wall. The ejection fraction improved from 17 to 49%.\\nNon Ischemic cardiomyopathy:\\nNon Ischemic cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of other causes of heart dysfunct\\nion, like coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease. We will discuss the cardiomyopathies listed in the table on the left. HCM with narrow\\n left ventricular outflow tract (yellow arrow), systolic anterior motion of anterior leaflet of mitral valve (blue arrow) and mitral regurgitation (red arrow)\\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy:\\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by a hypertrophied left ventricle, defined as diastolic wall thickness 15mm or more, without any identifiable cause such as hypert\\nension or valvular disease. Normal ventricular septal measurement is 8-12 mm. Usually there is asymmetric thickening of the wall most prominently involving the ventricular septum wi\\nthout abnormal enlargement of the ventricular cavities. It is a genetic myocardial disorder with a prevalence of 1:500. In about 25% of patients there is obstruction of the left ven\\ntricular outflow tract (LVOT) due to hypertrophy of the basal septum and a systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM). In these cases the term HOCM or hypertrophic obstructi\\nve cardiomyopathy is used.\\nThe systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is probably the result of the increased flow velocity and decreased pressure above the valve caused by the hypertrophied interventri\\ncular septum (the Venturi effect). In the vast majority of patients the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valva is the mechanism of obstruction in HCM and also the cause of the\\n mitral regurgitation. On an end-systolic image the following findings can be depicted (figure): HOCM with hypertrophic basal septum. HOCM (2) On the left an end-diastolic image.

On the left the 3-chamber movie post-alcohol ablation with thinning of the basal septum and normalization of the\\n function of the mitral valve.\\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy - Amyloidosis:\\nThe most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy is amyloidosis [20]. \\nAmyloid deposits in the myocardium cause abnormal diastolic function with biatrial enlargement, concentric thickening of the left ventricle and reduced systolic function of usually \\nboth ventricles. Cardiac involvement in systemic amyloidosis occurs in up to 50% and has a poor prognosis with a median survival of 6 months [3]. On the left a 4-chamber movie of a \\npatient with amyloidosis.

              " Document(page_content=\"Constrictive cardiomyopathy:\\nThe most important differential diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy is constrictive cardiomyopathy. MRI can differentiate between those two diagnoses: On the left the 4-chamber \\nmovie in a patient with constrictive CM. Notice the diastolic septal bounce which is typical for constrictive cardiomyopathy. Same patient, short axis movie.\\nDilated cardiomyopathy:\\nDilated cardiomyopathy is defined as dilatation with an end diastolic diameter greater than 55mm measured on the left ventricular outflow image and an ejection fraction < 40%. Patie\\nnts with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy show either no enhancement or linear midmyocardial enhancement [24]. This enhancement is explained by the presence of fibrosis. This indic\\nates a poorer prognosis. Patients with midmyocardial enhancement are at higher risk of sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias [25]. On the left a 4-chamber view of a patient with idio\\npathic cardiomyopathy. Notice the mitral regurgitation. Continue with the late enhancement image. The late enhancement image does not show any enhancement. This is compatible with i\\ndiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (2) The differentiation between idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is important, as ische\\nmic cardiomyopathy might be treated with revascularization and idiopathic disease not. Late enhancement MRI will show subendocardial enhancement in patients with ischemic cardiomyop\\nathy. On the left a 4-chamber movie of a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy. Continue with the late enhancement image. Late enhancement image in a patient with ischemic dilated car\\ndiomyopathy . Note the characteristic subendocardial enhancement. The late enhancement MRI shows subendocardial enhancement in this patient. So we can conclude that this is dilated \\ncardiomyopathy as a result of ischemia. Dilated cardiomyopathy (3) In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy it is important to determine the ejection fraction. According to the guide\\nlines of ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 [26] there is an indication for an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) if: On the left the 4-chamber view of a patient with the idiopat\\nhic dilated cardiomyopathy.

There is midmyocardial septal en\\nhancement consistent with fibrosis. Left: fatty infiltration in the myocardium of the anterior wall of the dilated right ventricle (arrows) Right: dilated right ventricular outflow \\ntract with micro-aneurysm (arrow).\\nARVC:\\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited cardiomyopathy whose hallmark is fibrofatty replacement of the RV myocardium. The left ventricle is also invol\\nved in at least 15% of patients. The patients develop progressive RV failure and present with ventricular arrhythmias which can cause sudden cardiac death especially in young people\\n. Morphologically the right ventricle can have regional wall thinning, hypertrophy, dilatation and microaneurysms. \\nFunctionally  cine images are evaluated for RV dysfunction, microaneurysm formation, and focal areas of RV dyskinesia. MR scans may be overinterpreted since the RV has substantial n\\normal variations including variable trabeculation and small outward bulges near the insertion of the moderator band. On the left axial black-blood images of a patient with fatty ARV\\nC. There are two variants of ARVC: fatty and fibro-fatty. The fatty form is characterized by fatty replacement of the myocardium without thinning of the ventricular wall. The fibro-\\nfatty form is associated with significant thinning of the right ventricular wall. The sites of involvement are mostly found in the subtricuspid area, the right ventricular apex, and\\n the infundibulum, the 'triangle of dysplasia' [4]. On the left a 4-chamber movie in a patient with ARVC.\\nNotice the dilated right ventricle with severe segmental hypo- and dyskinesis resulting in small aneurysms.

Left: axial black-blood image of a patient with fibro-fatty ARVC Right: late enhancement image shows \\nenhancement of the anterior wall of the right ventricle (arrow). ARVC (2) MRI can show segmental hypokinesis, dilatation, fatty infiltration in the right ventricular myocardium, sma\\nll aneurysms and late enhancement of the myocardium [5,27]. Fat infiltration is seldom the only abnormality seen on MRI in ARVC, it should coincide with right ventricular regional d\\nysfunction [28]. The diagnosis ARVC cannot be made on MRI findings alone. On the left a 4-chamber movie of a patient with ARVC. There is a dilated right ventricle with severe segmen\\ntal hypokinesis and dyskinesis. ARVC (3) The diagnosis is based on major and minor Task Force criteria, many of which involve clinical and laboratory information [29]. Major criteri\\na demonstrated by MRI are: Minor criteria shown by MRI include [27] : Myocarditis: midmyocardial enhancement\\nMyocarditis:\\nMyocarditis is often caused by a viral infection. Acute myocarditis can be a cause of sudden cardiac death. Most patients spontaneously recover, however 5-10% of the patients will d\\nevelop a dilated cardiomyopathy [30]. Acute myocarditis may clinically mimic an acute myocardial infarction with chest pain. Abnormal laboratory findings and ECG changes may also su\\nggest an acute coronary syndrome. The MRI findings however are discriminatory between those two diagnoses. The late enhancement images are key, as the late enhancement in myocarditi\\ns is subepicardially or midmyocardially located, and does not originate from the subendocardium [30]. On the left a patient with myocarditis. Notice the midmyocardial enhancement of\\n the lateral wall. Myocarditis: 10 months later the midmyocardial enhancement of the lateral wall has diminished. Same patient with myocarditis. Notice that the midmyocardial enhanc\\nement of the lateral wall has diminished. Myocarditis (2) Most lesions with myocarditis occur in the lateral free wall. Wall motion abnormalities may or may not be present. There is\\n a potential relationship between the location of late enhancement, the etiologic virus and the prognosis [31]. On the left a patient with myocarditis. The 4-chamber movie demonstra\\ntes hypokinesia of the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Continue with the movie 10 months later. 4-chamber movie 10 months later. The lateral wall is now normokinetic. LEFT: Octo\\npus pot RIGHT: left ventricle angiogram in a patient with Tako tsubo cardiomyopathy. There is only contraction of the basal segments (blue arrows) and the mid- and apical segments b\\nalloon.\\nTako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy:\\nTako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning syndrome is a transient cardiomyopathy affecting postmenopausal women after physical or emotional stress. Patients present with sympto\\nms mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. The ECG changes and abnormal laboratory findings may also mimic an infarction. However, coronary angiography is usually normal, but if a\\n left ventricle angiogram is performed, marked hypokinesia of the apical cardiac segments is noted (figure). The Japanese word takotsubo means octopus pot. This pot was used to capt\\nure octopus and resembles the shape of the left ventricle during systole in these patients These apical wall motion abnormalities are well seen with MRI. The motion abnormalities ar\\ne transient and return to normal within weeks. On the left a patient with Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy. Notice the hypokinesia of the apex. The apical wall motion abnormalities were tr\\nansient and returned to normal within weeks. Continue with the late enhancement image. Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy: no late enhancement Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (2) Typically there i\\ns no late enhancement, which distinguishes it from an infarction [4]. The pathogenesis is unknown, but it is probably caused by the release of catecholamines.

              " Document(page_content=\"Acute Abdomen in Neonates:\\nJoosje Bomer, Samuel Stafrace, Robin Smithuis and Herma Holscher\\nAkershus Universitetssykehus in Lørenskog, Norway, Sidra Medicine in Doha, Qatar, Alrijne hospital in Leiden and Juliana Children's Hospital in the Hague, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2018-05-01 A neonate with an acute abdomen usually presents with vomiting, constipation and distention of the belly. When the symptoms are present immediately after \\nbirth, the most common cause is a gastrointestinal obstruction. In this article we will discuss the congenital gastrointestinal obstructions and also some acquired diseases that pre\\nsent as an acute abdomen in the neonate.\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\nThe table on the left lists the differential diagnosis for acute abdomen in the neonate. High obstructions are defined as proximal to the ileum. Low obstructions are defined as occu\\nring in the ileum or colon. Although in high obstruction vomiting will be the most striking symptom, whereas in low obstruction this will be constipation, both symptoms are often pr\\nesent concurrently, and the clinical differentiation between a high and a low obstruction is difficult. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are the mos\\nt common acquired causes of an acute abdomen in the neonate. NEC is most common in prematures, especially when there is an extreme low birthweight. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typ\\nically presents at the age of 4-8 weeks, but can sometimes present in the early neonatal period.\\nImaging:\\nAbdominal radiograph:\\nIn suspected neonatal obstruction the first step is an abdominal radiograph. On the radiograph an obstruction can only be diagnosed if the bowel has had sufficient time to become ai\\nr-filled after birth. The table shows the normal progression of air in the gastrointestinal tract. The things to look for on the abdominal radiograph are listed in the table. We wil\\nl discuss each of these items separately. In addition to the front view, the dorsal decubitus radiograph (cross-table view with horizontal beams) should be performed, which can depi\\nct free air and sometimes can aid in differentiating the small intestine from the colon. On the radiograph also check lines and catheters and study the lungs, soft tissues and skele\\ntal structures. Calcifications in the abdominal wall can be seen in meconium peritonitis.\\n1. Dilatation?:\\nWhen the bowel measures more than the interpedicular width of L2, it is said to be dilated. Massive dilatation is seen in complete obstruction and is accompanied by fluid levels on \\nthe dorsal decubitus radiograph. However, fluid levels alone do not necessarily correspond to dilatation, but rather reflect abnormal peristalsis. An unchanging bowel gas pattern ov\\ner time indicates absence of perstalsis. On the left image the bowel is dilated and the diameter exceeds L2 interpedicular width in a patient with meconium ileus. On the image on th\\ne right there is massive dilatation in a neonate with jejunal atresia.\\n2. Number of dilated loops?:\\nUp til three dilated small bowel loops on an abdominal radiograph generally indicate a high obstruction. The left image shows a case of jejunal atresia. More than three dilated loop\\ns indicate a low obstruction. The image on the right is a case of ileal atresia.\\n3. Small bowel or colon?:\\nSince neonates do not have haustra in the colon yet, it is often impossible to discriminate between small bowel and colon on an AP radiograph. A dorsal decubitus radiograph may help\\n as colonic obstruction may produce long fluid levels. Furthermore, the colon ascendens, descendens and rectum are more dorsally located structures. To discriminate small bowel from\\n large bowel with certainty is only possible with a colon enema.\\n4. Airfilled rectum?:\\nIf sufficient time has gone by after birth, the rectum will be filled with air. Absence of rectal air indicates an obstruction. In Hirschsprung's disease there is usually no air in \\nthe rectum or only a thin stripe of air. The image shows a neonate with dilated bowel loops. There is no air in the rectum. This patient had a meconium ileus. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\n5. Pneumatosis intestinalis?:\\nStudy the image. What are the findings? Then scroll to the next image. Findings: Pneumatosis intestinalis is defined as gas in the bowel wall. In neonates it is seen in bowel wall i\\nschemia in necrotizing enterocolitis. On the radiograph pneumatosis intestinalis resembles granular feces, which is a normal finding in older children. Neonates however do not have \\ngranular feces yet since they only drink milk. So what looks like granular feces in the bowel actually represents intramural gas. The air bubbles can be resorbed into the venous sys\\ntem causing portal venous gas. Pneumatosis intestinalis can lead to perforation seen as pneumoperitoneum.\\n6. Free air and ascites?:\\nLarge amounts of free air can be seen on the front radiograph under the diaphragms, when visualizing both sides of the bowel wall and outlining the falciform ligament. Small amounts\\n of free air can only be detected on the dorsal decubitus radiograph. Ascites can only be suspected on a radiograph when the amounts are large enough to cause the bowel to float and\\n cluster in the center of the abdomen. The presence of both ascites, free air as well as abdominal wall calcifications indicate that there has been a perforation in utero with mecon\\nium peritonitis.\\nUpper GI study:\\nIn case of a typical complete high obstruction (see below) on the radiograph no further imaging is needed and upper GI series are not advised as they may only cause aspiration. When\\n the obstruction is incomplete or imaging results are equivocal, an upper GI is indicated. First aspirate air from a distended air-filled stomach. Always use water-soluble contrast \\nin neonates and inject slowly. Do not distend the stomach too much. Look for dilatation and stenosis and document the position of Treitz' ligament. To correctly depict Treitz' ligam\\nent, the child has to lie flat and straight as rotation may falsely simulate malrotation. If you do not plan to take more images later, aspirate the injected contrast from the stoma\\nch at the end of the examination. Here an upper GI study showing the normal position of Treitz' ligament to the left of the spine (arrow). It reaches as high as the bulbus duodeni o\\nr even higher. In malrotation, which we will discuss later, Treitz is positioned to the right of the spine. Microcolon: elongated colon with smalldiameter. It indicates that meconiu\\nm has not reached the colon yet. Once the obstruction is relieved and bowel contents pass through the colon, the colon will develop normally without remaining consequences.\\nColon enema:\\nIn cases of suspected low obstruction, a colon enema is indicated. Use water-soluble contrast for two reasons: the thick barium can make the evacuation of meconium even more trouble\\nsome and water-soluble contrast can be an effective therapeutic enema in cases of meconium plugging or meconium ileus. You may choose to use a balloon catheter, but do not distend t\\nhe balloon prior to evaluating the rectum and excluding Hirschsprung disease, as the high pressure from the balloon can cause a rectal perforation! In experienced hands a balloon ca\\nn be inflated if this is deemed necessary to reach complete filling and do this under careful fluoroscopic vision. Lateral images from the rectum and sigmoid should be documented fi\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 146}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"rst followed by frontal images. Focus on the diameter of the rectum versus the remainder of the colon, the presence of a microcolon and meconium pellets. In Hirschsprung disease it \\nis sufficient to determine the length of the affected bowel, but in other conditions one should aim for filling of the terminal ileum, as the obstruction can be located in the ileum\\n.\\nUltrasound:\\nUltrasound plays a limited role in depicting GI tract pathology as the gas-filled bowel will strongly reflect the ultrasound beam. There are however some exceptions. Here ultrasound\\n images of a neonate who presented with an acute abdomen. An ultrasound antenatally had detected a duplication cyst. On the ultrasound there is a whirlpool sign of the vessels. Tors\\nion of the cyst and the mesentery had resulted in a volvulus. This is a medical emergency and consequently the neonate went straight to the operating room.\\nCongenital High Obstruction:\\nMost high obstructions occur at the level of the duodenum. Vomiting will be non-bilious if the obstruction is localized proximal to the Vater ampulla, and bilious (the color or whic\\nh is green) if it is localized distal to it. Bilious vomiting is an indication for urgent imaging as a volvolus may be present.\\nEsophageal atresia:\\nFirst look at the image and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are: Diagnosis: esophagus atresia with a distal tracheo-esophageal fistula Esophagus atresia i\\ns an anomaly which arises in the fourth week of the embryogenesis, at a stadium in which the trachea and esophagus should separate from each other. In case of failure of complete se\\nparation esopaghus atresia can occur. Clinically the neonate cannot swallow saliva, may blow bubbles and will aspirate on feeding. When a feeding tube is inserted it cannot be passe\\nd distally. A radiograph with a curled up feeding tube will confirm the diagnosis. Contrast swallow studies should not be performed as they can cause severe aspiration. Often the pr\\noximal pharyngeal pouch is dilated. In 80% of cases a distal tracheo-esophageal fistula is present. Less common is: First look at the image and describe the findings. Then continue \\nreading. The findings are: Cases without a distal fistula can be suspected antenatally when there is a polyhydramnion and an empty stomach. Always screen the radiograph for other an\\nomalies as esophagus atresia can be part of the VACTERL association (vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiovascular malformations, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, renal and limb ano\\nmalies).\\nDuodenal atresia:\\nIn duodenal atresia the duodenum fails to canalize properly late in the first trimester and a web or several webs occur. In cases of atresia the web is complete. Most often the atre\\nsia occurs distal to Vater's ampulla. The obstruction causes the duodenum to expand and this creates the double bubble sign (dilated stomach and duodenum). When a polyhydramnion and\\n a double bubble are present antenatally, the diagnosis can be suspected before birth. First look at the image and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are: Th\\nis confirms the diagnosis of duodenal atresia and no further imaging is needed. In extreme prematures the diagnosis can be more challenging when the duodenum has not had enough time\\n to dilate. Here another case of duodenal atresia with the typical double bubble sign. Note that the nasogastral tube may decompress the stomach and duodenum limiting the interpreta\\ntion of the film. One may inject some air through the tube prior to the film. About 30% of the patients with duodenal atresia have Down syndrome and there is an association with VAC\\nTERL malformations, malrotation and biliary tree abnormalities.\\nDuodenal web:\\nFirst look at the image and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are: This radiograph was taken only a few hours after birth and air has not reached the distal\\n small bowel and colon yet. Duodenal web has the same etiology as duodenal atresia, but the web is fenestrated and the obstruction is incomplete. Depending on the severity of the st\\nenosis, patients may present in the neonatal period or at a later age. Radiographs may show a double bubble, but with distal bowel gas being present. Here another case of a duodenal\\n web. Both radiographs and upper GI series cannot differentiate between duodenal web and annular pancreas. Annular pancreas however, is less common. It is often discovered incidenta\\nlly or in adults when the associated abnormal biliary drainage causes pancreatitis. Another rare diagnosis with similar radiological findings is the preduodenal portal vein - often \\nassociated with other abnormalities in the abdomen (like situs ambiguus). p= pylorus. First look at the images of the upper GI-study and describe the findings. Then continue reading\\n. The findings are:\\nMalrotation:\\nIn the developing embryo growth of the bowel requires herniation into the omphalomesenteric sac. In the tenth week of gestation the bowel returns to the abdominal cavity. This retur\\nn is accompanied by a counterclockwise rotation of the midgut to achieve its final position with the ligament of Treitz in the left upper quadrant and the caecum in the right lower \\nquadrant, suspended from a long mesentery. Malrotation arises when the rotation is arrested or even reversed. As a result the bowel has an abnormal position, the mesentery is short \\nand peritoneal bands, called Ladd's bands, may cross from the caecum to the liver or to the anterior abdominal wall. Treitz ligament is on the left side of the spine. The small inte\\nstine is predominantly on the left. The cecum is in the right lower quadrant There is a long mesentery. Displacement of Treitz inferiorly and rightward. The small intestine is found\\n predominantly on the right. Fibrous bands course over the vertical portion of the duodenum causing obstruction.\\n* Right Volvulus due to short mesentery. Ischemic bowel. Here a neonate with a malrotation. The abdominal radiograph is non-specific (image on the left) The upper GI study clearly d\\nemonstrates that the small bowel projects to the right of the spine. The malrotation will become symptomatic only when a volvulus occurs due to the short mesentery or when the Ladd'\\ns band obstruct the duodenum Both presentations are most common in the neonatal period. However sometimes it can also present later in life, for example when the volvulus is intermi\\nttent or when the Ladd's bands create relatively little obstruction. Acute volvolus is a life-threatening presentation and requires prompt surgical intervention. The upper GI-study \\nshows a malrotation complicated by a volvulus. This results in the typical corkscrew or reversed 3 sign. An overfilled stomach could hide the corkscrew on the AP projection so the s\\ntomach should first be aspirated by use of a nasogastric tube and the volume of injected contrast should be small. Sometimes a malrotation can be suspected when on ultrasound the su\\nperior mesenteric artery is seen to lie to the right of the superior mesenteric vein. This sign however is neither specific nor sensitive and should not be used when asked to invest\\nigate for suspected malrotation without a volvulus. An abnormal location of ligament of Treitz on an upper GI series is the gold standard for malrotation. In case of a volvolus the \\nchild is acutely sick and ultrasound is often the modality of choice. This will show a whirlpool sign of the vessels which confirms the presence of a volvolus. The corkscrew sign of\\n the bowel on the upper GI is equivalent. Once a volvolus is diagnosed on ultrasound, the child should go straight to the operating room and no more time should be lost on further i\\nmaging.\\nJejunal atresia:\\nJejunal atresia is the most frequent cause of upper intestinal obstruction. It is caused by an ischemic event in utero. Antenatally a polyhydramnion will be present. More atretic fo\\nci can be present simultaneously. A typical case will show a triple bubble sign on a radiograph, with the third bubble being the dilated jejunum (figure). The radiographs however ar\\ne not always straightforward. When in doubt, an upper GI-study is indicated which will confirm the occlusion. Here another case of jejunal atresia.\\nCongenital Low Obstruction:\\nA low obstruction is an obstruction in the ileum or in the colon. Passage of meconium should normally occur within 48 hours from birth. In a low obstruction the neonate will have di\\nfficulty passing meconium or will not pass any meconium at all. Because of the constipation the child will start to vomit. The presence of a microcolon on the colon enema indicates \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 147}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"that the meconium has not reached the colon and the obstruction is situated proximal to the colon.\\nIleal atresia:\\nAs with jejunal atresia, ileal atresia results from an in utero ischemic event. More atretic foci can be present simultaneously, but the distal ileum is the most common site to be i\\nnvolved. Radiographs will show multiple dilated bowel loops and absence of air in the colon as seen on the image on the left. A colon enema will show a microcolon with contrast fill\\ning ending blind in the ileum (arrow on image on the right).\\nMeconium ileus:\\nMeconium ileus occurs nearly exclusively in patients with cystic fibrosis. In 10% of patients it is the first presentation of the disease. Due to the exocrine dysfunction of the pan\\ncreas and abnormal intestinal secretions, the meconium is abnormally thick and becomes impacted in the ileum. It is the neonatal equivalent of DIOS (distal intestinal obstruction sy\\nndrome). Sometimes radiographs demonstrate typical 'soap bubbles', which represent captured air between meconium pellets. The tenacious meconium prevents the occurence of air fluid \\nlevels on the decubitus image. Bowel loops are usually of different caliber and not all loops are dilated. Colon enema shows a microcolon with stacked meconium pellets in the ileum.\\n Once you have made the diagnosis of a meconium ileus, you can opt to set in moderately hyperosmolar contrast for therapeutic purposes as this can help to dissolve the meconium and \\nact as an effective enema. Since the hyperosmolar contrast will create a fluid shift and thereby may cause dehydration, it is of importance to clearly communicate with the clinician\\n to administer extra fluids and secure continuous careful surveillance. Here two cases of meconium ileus. There is a microcolon and there are multiple meconium pellets in the distal\\n small bowel (arrows). Meconiumplugsyndrome: normal rectum and a small diameter to the left colon. Because the child has a functionally normal rectum he continued to evacuate the co\\nntrast and a balloon catheter had to be used.\\nMeconium plug syndrome:\\nMeconium plug syndrome is also known as small left colon syndrome. Meconium plugging in the left colon occurs when the colon is functionally immature with little motility. There is \\nan association with maternal diabetes and drug use in pregnancy. The condition is temporarily and when the meconium plugs resolve, the colon distends normally and functions normally\\n. The neonate is otherwise healthy and there is no association with cystic fibrosis. There is no air in the rectum on the radiograph. Colon enema shows a normal rectal diameter whic\\nh excludes Hirschsprung disease. A microcolon is absent. Meconium is found throughout the colon, but most typically found in the left colon, which may also have a smaller diameter. \\nJust as with a meconium ileus, you may now opt to give a hyperosmolar contrast enema to help resolve the meconium (see above).\\nHirschsprung disease:\\nIn Hirschsprung disease ganglion cells are absent in the distal part of the colon. Because the intestinal ganglion cells migrate in a craniocaudal direction, the area of aganglionos\\nis always involves the rectum. More extensive disease extends orally in a contiguous fashion. The involved bowel has a small diameter and the bowel proximal to the affected segment \\nis dilated. In Hirschsprung disease the ratio between the denervated and the non-affected bowel is <1. It is important to describe the length of the affected segment. Most cases are\\n short-segment and total aganglionosis is rare. In case of total aganglionosis the diagnosis is difficult, because the entire colon has a small caliber and resembles a microcolon. S\\naw tooth contractions in Hirschsprung disease Start the enema in the lateral position to evaluate the rectum.

About 90% of Hirschsprung disease is diagnosed in the neonatal age, but s\\nome cases are discovered later in life. Anal atresia: markers are placed on the external sphincter. The rectum ends blind (*)\\nAnal atresia:\\nThe diagnosis of anal atresia is usually clinically straightforward by inspection and digital palpation. Anal atresia is part of the spectrum of anorectal and cloacal malformations \\nand is a complex disorder. Imaging and treatment should be performed in specialized centers. Initially plain films and ultrasound can be used to show the position of the malformatio\\nn and the need for a colostomy. At a later stage and prior to definitive surgery a combination of fluoroscopic studies and MRI will be used to show the complex anatomy of anorectal,\\n genitourinary, pelvic and perineal structures and associated fistulas. Anal atresia is part of the VACTERL malformations and patients should be screened for concomittant anomalies.\\nAcquired causes of acute abdomen:\\nNecrotizing enterocolitis:\\nNecrotizing enterocolitis is a severe bowel inflammation. The etiology is not entirely clear and seems to be a combination of immature bowel mucosa, infection and ischemia. Initiall\\ny radiographs are nonspecific and may only show bowel dilatation. Absence of a changing bowel pattern over time is worrisome. Pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous air (pneumop\\nortogram) can both be seen on radiographs and with ultrasound. The most feared complication is perforation. Pneumatosis intestinalis in a child with NEC NEC occurs most often, but n\\not exclusively, in prematures. Neonates with severe stress, for example with cardiac disease, are also at risk. Clinically, retentions and bloody stools can be a key to the diagnosi\\ns. The images show a typical case of NEC with pneumatosis intestinalis. On the horizontal beam image there is no sign of free air. Here images of a neonate who developed NEC. At thi\\ns early stage the radiograph only shows non-specific bowel dilatation. At this stage you cannot make the diagnosis. Here another typical case of NEC. Notice the air in the portal ve\\nin (arrow) and peripheral portal branches. This is seen on the X-Ray and on ultrasound. In this patient with NEC notice all the airbubbles in the wall of the bowel and within the li\\nver. Pneumoperitoneum in severe NEC. Air can be seen on both sides of the bowel wall. This is called the Rigler sign. In about 20% of patients with NEC strictures can occur in a lat\\ner stage. Sometimes necrotizing enterocolitis can have a subclinical course and strictures are the only sign the newborn has endured the disease. The image on the left is taken 6 da\\nys after birth and shows distended bowel with pneumatosis intestinalis. A colon enema at 6 weeks of age shows a stricture in the colon descendens (arrow). Here a long stricture in t\\nhe colon transversum in a child who had a NEC.\\nHypertrophic pyloric stenosis:\\nProjectile vomiting is the key feature in patients with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The cause of the muscle hypertrophy which causes the gastric outlet obstruction is unknown. Th\\nere is a familial predisposition and it is more common in boys. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents after the neonatal period, at the age of 4-8 weeks. However early pr\\nesentation can also occur. Ultrasound in a fasting child will show retained fluid in the stomach. There is no passage along the hypertrophic pyloric muscle. For optimal viewing the \\nchild must be positioned right side down and if the stomach is empty it should be filled by drinking Pedialyte or glucose solution during the examination. If the stomach is too full\\n, the child can be placed on the left side to help the pylorus to move anteriorly. The transversal diameter of the single muscle wall is the most reliable measurement to diagnose py\\nloric muscle hypertrophy. A measurement of more than 3 mm on a transverse image indicates hypertrophy. A transverse total diameter more than 14 mm and a total length of the pyloric \\ncanal more than 15 mm support the diagnosis.\\nIncarcerated hernia:\\nNeonates and especially prematures have a relatively weak abdominal wall and inguinal hernias are common, especially in boys. In case of multiple dilated bowel loops on the radiogra\\nph, always check the groins for the presence of a hernia containing a bowel loop (figure). Ultrasound is the modality of choice to evaluate hernias, and in girls it is important to \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",

In Ovarian Cystic Masses Part I a roadmap f\\nor the diagnostic workup and management of ovarian cystic masses is presented based on the findings of ultrasound and MRI. Images can be enlarged by clicking on them. On the iPhone \\napplication this results in hi-res images at full retina resolution.\\nNormal ovaries:\\npremenopausal:\\nThe normal ovary contains over two million primary oocytes at birth, about 10 of which mature each menstrual cycle. Of the 10 Graafian follicles that begin to mature, only one becom\\nes the dominant follicle and grows to a size of 18-20 mm by mid-cycle, when it ruptures to release the oocyte. The other nine follicles become atretic and fibrous. After release of \\nthe oocyte, the dominant follicle collapses, and the granulosa cells in the inner lining proliferate and swell to form the corpus luteum of menstruation. Over the course of 14 days \\nthe corpus luteum degenerates, leaving the small scarred corpus albicans. Graafian follicles Graafian follicles The normal ovary in pre-menopausal women contains small cysts. The im\\nages show two normal ovaries with several anechoic, simple cysts consistent with Graafian follicles. On T2-weighted MR-images the Graafian follicles are seen as bright cysts surroun\\nded by darker solid ovarian stroma. FDG-PET pitfall - normal premenopausal ovaries In some pre-menopausal women the normal ovaries may be avidly PET positive, depending on the date \\nin the menstrual cycle. Because in pre-menopausal women a PET-positive ovary may be either an adnexal neoplasm or completely normal, it is important to be aware of the possibility o\\nf physiologic mid-cycle FDG uptake and to correlate this finding with the clinical history. FDG-PET in pre-menopausal women should therefore preferably be scheduled in the first wee\\nk of the menstrual cycle. In post-menopausal women, the normal ovaries show only minimal uptake of FDG. Any increased ovarian FDG uptake in this age group is suspicious for a possib\\nle neoplasm. LEFT: Postmenopausal woman. The ovary is a T2 dark tissue clump near the proximal end of the round ligament.RIGHT: T2 dark left ovary devoid of follicles. It is a bit p\\nrominent, but is still likely to be normal\\nPost-menopausal:\\nPost-menopause is defined as 1 year or more of amenorrhea. In Western countries the average age of menopause is 51-53 years. In post-menopausal women the ovaries are generally small\\ner and gradually stop forming Graafian follicles. Note, however, that follicular cysts may persist several years after menopause. In the coronal T2-weighted image of a postmenopausa\\nl woman the ovary is no more than a dark tissue clump near the proximal end of the round ligament. The axial T2-weighted image also shows a dark left ovary, devoid of follicles. Alt\\nhough a bit prominent, this is likely to be completely normal. Only if, by chance, there happened to be prior imaging showing that the lesion was growing, your differential diagnosi\\ns would start with a benign solid lesion such as ovarian fibroma or fibrothecoma.\\nFunctional cysts:\\nBy far the most common cystic ovarian lesions are benign functional ovarian cysts. Functional cysts are Graafian follicles or corpora lutea that have grown too large or have bled, b\\nut are otherwise benign. In the early post-menopause phase, 1-5 years after the final menstrual period, sporadic ovulatory cycles still may occur and ovarian cysts may be seen. Even\\n in late menopause, which is defined as more than 5 years since the final menstrual period, when ovulation is unlikely to occur, small simple cysts may be seen in up to 20% of women\\n.\\nFollicular cyst:\\nA dominant Graafian follicle sometimes fails to ovulate and does not involute. When it becomes larger than 3 cm, it is called a follicular cyst. Follicular cysts are usually 3-8 cm,\\n but may become much larger. On ultrasound follicular cysts present as simple unilocular, anechoic cysts with a thin, smooth wall. There should be no enhancing nodules or other soli\\nd components, no enhancing septations, and no more than physiologic ascites. Follicular cysts will usually resolve spontaneously on follow-up.\\nCorpus luteum cyst:\\nA corpus luteum may seal and fill with fluid or blood, forming a corpus luteum cyst.

Note, there is good through-transmission and no internal vascularity, consistent w\\nith a, partially involuted, corpus luteum cyst. Remember that women who are on birth control pills usually won't form a corpus luteum, as birth control pills prevent ovulation. On t\\nhe other hand, use of fertility drugs that induce ovulation, increases the chance of developing corpus luteum cysts. Corpus luteum cyst Another case with the typical the 'ring of fi\\nre' on ultrasound. At pathologic examination the collapsed bloody cyst can be clearly seen. Corpus luteum cyst Corpus luteum cyst at MRI: an axial T2-weighted image demonstrating an\\n involuting corpus luteum cyst (arrow). This is a normal finding. The right ovary is also normal. Hemorrhagic cyst with a clot mimicking a neoplasm. Notice absence of flow and good \\nthrough-transmission\\nHemorrhagic ovarian cyst:\\nWhen a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. On ultrasound hemorrhagic ovarian cyst presents as an unilocular thin-walled \\ncyst with fibrin-strands or low-level echoes and good through transmission. On MRI hemorrhagic cysts are bright on pre-contrast T1-FatSat, and dark on T2. There should be no interna\\nl vascularity on Doppler ultrasound or internal enhancement on CT or MRI. Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts have variable wall thickness, and often some circumferential vascularity can be s\\neen. Clinically the classic presentation is with acute pain. However HOC can also be an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst The ultrasound images\\n show multiple simple and one complex right ovarian lesion (red arrow). The latter demonstrates diffuse low-level echos and no flow on Doppler. Note that there is a good through tra\\nnsmission (blue arrow). These findings indicate the presence of a hemorrhagic cyst. Continue with the MR-images. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst Axial and sagittal T2W images from the same\\n patient. The right ovary contains multiple simple T2 bright cysts with thin borders and no solid components. On the axial image there is one lesion, that is dark on T2, i.e. a comp\\nlex cyst (arrow). There is a small amount of ascites around the right ovary, but not enough to raise concern of a possible neoplasm. On the T1-weighted image without fatsat the comp\\nlex cyst is bright, indicating either fat or blood content. On the T1-weighted image with fatsat the lesion remains bright, ruling out a fatty lesion. After the administration of Gd\\n there is no enhancement, confirming that this is a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. An endometrioma would be in your differential. Note that subtraction images are best to demonstrate the\\n lack of enhancement in a lesion, that is bright on the pre-contrast T1-weighted image. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in both right and left ovary The ultrasound images show the right an\\nd left ovary: on both sides there is what appears to be a solid lesion. There is however good through transmission, which indicates that we are probably dealing with hemorrhagic cys\\nts. On Doppler US (not shown) there was no vascularity. Continue with the MR examination. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst On an axial T1-weighted image both lesions are bright indicating f\\nat, blood or high protein fluid. Fat saturation does not suppress the signal in these lesions. In an image with overall reasonably good fat suppression this rules out a fat-containi\\nng teratoma and confirms the suggestion of hemorrhagic fluid. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. Left:image without subtraction. Right: image with subtraction. On the axial T2-weighted image\\n both lesions show typical 'shading'. The gradual drop in T2 is thought to be caused by a combination of increasing viscosity and increasing concentration of protein and iron toward\\ns the dependent portion of the lesion. There is no enhancement on the subtraction image (Post-Gd minus Pre-Gd). Again, subtraction is useful in cases like this: Gd-induced signal in\\ncrease over the already very bright pre-contrast image would be very hard to appreciate otherwise.\\nOther benign cystic and cyst-like lesions:\\nVaginal ultrasound showing a large hypoechoic cystic lesion with diffuse low-level echo's\\nEndometrioma:\\nCystic endometriosis or endometrioma is a type of cyst formed when endometrial tissue grows in the ovaries. It affects women during the reproductive years and may cause chronic pelv\\nic pain associated with menstruation. The ovaries are involved in approximately 75% of patients with endometriosis. On ultrasound endometrioma can be variable but the great majority\\n (about 95%) of patients present with a classic homogeneous, hypoechoic cyst with diffuse low level echoes. Rarely it is anechoic, mimicking a functional ovarian cyst. Endometriomas\\n can be multilocular and have thin or even thick septations. Transvaginal ultrasound: endometrioma with two hyperechoic wall foci, consistent with cholesterol deposits (arrows) In a\\nbout one third of patients, on careful examination, small echogenic foci can be seen adhering to the wall. These have been postulated to be cholesterol deposits, but may also consti\\ntute small blood clots or debris. It is important to differentiate these foci from true wall nodules. In the presence of these foci, the diagnosis of an endometrioma is very likely.\\n The transvaginal ultrasound shows a typical endometrioma, with hyperechoic wall foci. At Doppler US no vascularity was seen in these foci (not shown). The next case is a transvagin\\nal US-image that shows a cystic lesion with a hyperechoic structure. There is a wide differential diagnosis including ovarian cystic neoplasm with solid component, mature cystic ter\\natoma with hyperechoic Rokitansky nodule, hemorrhagic cyst with clot and endometrioma with clot or debris. Continue with the CT and MR. Endometrioma A CT was requested that turned o\\nut to show the same, predominantly cystic lesion. If additional imaging is needed for cysts that are indeterminate at ultrasound, it is better to perform MRI. The T2-weighted image \\non the right correlates nicely with the ultrasound image. On T2-weighted images endometriomas typically show 'shading'. LEFT: Gd-enhanced T1-weighted image with fatsat. RIGHT: Subtr\\naction image. MRI confirms the absence of any enhancement, confirming that it is most likely debris within the cyst. On MRI the hemorrhagic content will make endometrioma appear bri\\nght on T1-weighted images. On T1-fatsat images an endometrioma will remain bright. This in contrast to teratomas, that are also bright on T1 but dark on T1-fatsat images. Always inc\\nlude a T1 fat suppressed sequence, because this makes small T1 bright lesions more conspicuous. Endometrioma The next case is a unilocular, mildly hypoechoic ovarian lesion with thr\\nough transmission. There is no internal or wall vascularity on Doppler. On ultrasound this can again either be a hemorrhagic cyst or an endometrioma. Continue with the MR images End\\nometrioma 6 months later a follow-up MRI was performed. The lesions are bright on T1-weighted images. The bright signal persists on fat saturation indicating the presence of blood. \\nThere is T2 shading consistent with a hemorrhagic lesion. There is no enhancement. The fluid-fluid level in the right ovarian lesion also confirms its cystic nature. The fact that t\\nhe lesions persist after 6 months makes bilateral endometrioma much more likely than hemorrhagic cysts. Axial MR demonstrating characteristic 'string-of-pearls' appearance\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome:\\nThe Poly-Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Imaging can confirm or suggest the diagnosis. Imaging criteria: These patients usually have menstrua\\nl cycle irregularities and either typical clinical signs of hirsutism, obesity, infertility, acne, male balding pattern or biochemically show increased androgen levels. Sagittal MR-\\nimage in a patient with polycystic ovary syndrome On the left a sagittal T2-weighted image in a patient with increased serum androgen levels.

In this patient, MRI confirmed the diagnosis of PCOS.\\n Theca lutein cysts. The septations do not show enhancement on Doppler evaluation.\\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome - Theca lutein cysts:\\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a relatively rare condition. It is caused by hormonal overstimulation by hCG, and is therefore usually bilateral. Hormonal overstimulation can o\\nccur in gestational throphoblastic disease, PCOS or in patients receiving hormonal therapy. It can also be seen in pregnancy, but seldom in a normal single pregnancy. If it does occ\\nur in normal pregnancies, the reported natural course is spontaneous resolution after birth. In normal pregnancies the reported natural course is spontaneous resolution after birth.\\n Hormonal overstimulation more often occurs in molar pregnancy, erythroblastosis fetalis or in plural pregnancies. On imaging there is - usually bilateral - ovarian enlargement with\\n multiloculated cyst that can totally replace the ovary. The clinical history is the distinguishing feature to make the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Theca lutein \\ncysts: US images of a young pregnant woman.

The features needed to make the diagnosis of ovaria\\nn hyperstimulation syndrome are in the clinical history - a young pregnant woman - and in the last image of the uterus, which shows an invasive uterine mass, consistent with invasiv\\ne molar pregnancy.\\nPID with tubo-ovarian abscess:\\nTubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) usually arises as a complication of Chlamydia or Gonorrhoeae infection that rises from the vagina or cervix to the fallopian tubes. On imaging a thick-wal\\nled complex cystic ovarian lesion is seen with abundant flow. The presence of a thickened endometrium or hydrosalphinx makes the diagnosis of a PID more likely. The axial CECT image\\n shows a left complex cystic lesion with thick enhancing walls and internal gas. It looks like an abscess. Note the relatively unremarkable aspect of the overlying mesentery: this i\\ns unlikely to be a peri-diverticular abscess. Continue with the reconstructed images. On the sagittal image notice, that the lesion is connected to the ovarian vein confirming that \\nthis is an ovarian lesion (arrow). The coronal image shows the anatomic connection to the uterus. There is a gasbubble in the uterine cavity, which confirms the suggestion of an inf\\nection rising from the uterine cavity via the salphinx to involve the ovary (click or tap the image to enlarge).\\nBenign cystic ovarian neoplasms:\\nMature cystic teratoma with a Rokitansky nodule or dermoid plug\\nMature cystic teratoma:\\nA very common benign ovarian lesion that may appear cystic is a mature cystic teratoma, also called dermoid cyst. Mature in this context means benign, as opposed to the immature, ma\\nlignant teratoma. Benign cystic teratomas typically occur in young women of child-bearing age. At imaging they are usually unilocular (up to 90%) but can be multilocular, and are bi\\nlateral in ~15%. Up to 60% may contain calcifications. The cystic component is fluid fat, produced by sebaceous glands in cyst lining. The presence of fat is diagnostic. The charact\\neristic ultrasound appearance is that of a cystic mass, with a hyperechoic solid mural nodule, which is called a Rokitansky nodule or dermoid plug (figure). Tip-of-the-iceberg sign \\nIn another case the transvaginal ultrasound shows the 'tip-of-the-iceberg' sign: acoustic shadowing from the hyperechoic part of the dermoid cyst. This may be misinterpreted as bowe\\nl gas and the lesion may be overlooked. A fat-fluid level may be present, caused by fat floating on more aqueous fluid. Multiple thin, echogenic lines or stripes may be seen, caused\\n by hair floating in the cyst cavity. Mature cystic teratomas, even though benign, are often resected because of increased risk of ovarian torsion, the most commonly associated comp\\nlication. Other complications associated with teratoma are infection, rupture (spontaneous or trauma) and, rarely, hemolytic anemia (resolves with resection). Malignant transformati\\non can occur but is also rare ( Axial T1-weighted image in the same patient shows a bright lesion with an internal septation. A septation is seen in about 10% of thse lesions. On th\\ne T1-weighted image with fat suppression there is suppression of the signal. This confirms the fatty content and is diagnostic of a teratoma. Classic low attenuation consistent with\\n fat in a right sided cystic teratoma at CT.\\nCystadenoma and cystadenofibroma:\\nCystadenoma and cystadenofibroma are also common benign ovarian tumors. They can be either serous or mucinous. At imaging a serous cystadenoma is most often unilocular and anechoic,\\n and may look like a simple cyst. Mucinous cystadenomas are most often multilocular with thin (\\nThe locules may contain complex fluid, due to proteinaceous debris or hemorrhage, or both. The finding of papillary projections should raise the suspicion of a possible borderline m\\nalignancy or a cystadenocarcinoma. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a 5.1x5.2-cm dominant left ovarian cyst. The cyst is anechoic and no septations are seen. Also there is no ascites. \\nThere is, however, a nodule on the posterior wall that shows no flow on Doppler. This may be a follicular cyst with some debris, but a cystic neoplasm cannot be excluded. Work-up wi\\nth MRI is recommended. T2-weighted image of the same patient shows thin enhancing septations (as well as motion artifacts that should not be mistaken for septations). There are no t\\numor nodules and no adenopathy or peritoneal deposits. There is only a small amount of ascites. This proved to be a cystadenoma. The next case is another cystic lesion On the poster\\nior wall a solid mural nodule is found, which is avascular. No secondary signs of malignancy. Continue with the MRI. Five years later the lesion has grown. Axial T2 shows a complex \\ncystic left ovarian lesion, with a solid nodule on the posterior wall. At post-contrast axial T1W-FatSat the thin septa and the mural nodule show slight enhancement. On the basis of\\n these findings the distinction between a benign ovarian lesion such as a cystadenofibroma and a malignant lesion cannot be made. The lesion was resected and was found to be a cysta\\ndenofibroma. The next case is a transabdominal ultrasound that shows a left-sided multiloculated cystic mass. This looks like a cystic ovarian neoplasm but no ovary could be identif\\nied. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images CT of the same patient shows a multi-loculated cystic mass adjacent to the bladder, connected to the left ovarian vein (arrow). There are th\\nick septations and irregular wall thickening. On the basis of this CT the distinction between a benign ovarian lesion such as as cystadenofibroma and a malignant ovarian lesion cann\\not be made. The lesion was resected and found to be a cystadenofibroma.\\nMalignant cystic ovarian neoplasms:\\nRemember, the role of imaging is not to determine the histological nature of a lesion, but to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and guide decisions on further management. Th\\ne examples given here serve as a demonstration of suspicious imaging features, not as a guide for determination of histologic lesion type.\\nSerous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma:\\nUltrasound shows a complex solid-cystic mass in the left ovary, and another, very large complex solid-cystic mass in the right hemi-pelvis. CT of the same patient shows a complex so\\nlid-cystic mass with thick, enhancing septations in the right ovary. These findings are very suspicious for a malignant cystic neoplams. There is also bilateral lymphadenopathy (arr\\nows). Pathology showed a serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma. This is the most common type of ovarian cancer.\\nMucinous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma:\\nUltrasound shows a very large multi-loculated cystic lesion in the region of the right adnex. Some locules are anechoic. Others contain uniform low-level echoes, consistent with pro\\nteineous content, such as hemorrhage or, in this case, mucin. The septations are thin, except for the dorsal septations that appear somewhat thicker, partially caused by the lower s\\ncanresolution at great depth.\\nThe septations are avascular.\\nThere are no solid components.\\nThere was no ascites. Despite the absence of solid components and despite the absence of vascularity on color Doppler, the size and the multi-loculated aspect of this lesion are sus\\npicious for a cystic neoplasm and warant further evaluation. The CECT shows similar findings.\\nThe locules are of different attenuation, consistent with varying protein content. There is no ascites orperitoneal deposits and no lymphadenopathy. At pathology this was a mucinous\\n cystadenocarcinoma of low malignant potential. Specimen of the mucinous cystadenocarcinoma The thin, relatively avascular septae, the absence of frank solid components, the absence\\n of ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis and the absence of invasion, suggest a lesion of low malignant potential (LMP). Note however, that this diagnosis can not be made on imagin\\ng findings alone. Especially the absence of invasion in ovarian stroma cannot be judged reliably on imaging.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 151}),\n",

The complex solid-cystic lesions, in addition to being bil\\nateral, are suspicious for a cystic ovarian neoplasm and warrant further evaluation. Again, the role of imaging is to confirm a lesion is present and to decide that this is not a le\\nsion that can be classified as definitely benign nor a lesion that can be safely followed-up: action is required. CT of the same patient confirms large bilateral complex solid-cysti\\nc lesions, bulging into the abdomen.

Since the Weber-classification is a simplification of the Lauge-Hansen classification, it will help you to understand the different stages of Lauge-Hansen.\\nIntroduction:\\nAlgoritm for ankle fractures:\\nStep 1\\nThe first question you should ask yourself is:\\nIs it a Weber type A fracture?Is there an avulsion of the lateral malleolus. That’s easy. Step 2\\nIf it is not a type A. Then the next question is:\\nIs it a Weber type B fracture?This oblique fracture at the level of the syndesmosis is always easy to find on the x-rays. Step 3\\nIf it is not type A or type B, then the last question is:\\nCan this be a Weber type C fracture?These fractures are usually not visible on x-rays of the ankle, because the fibula fracture is too high, but the algoritm provides clues for the \\ndetection of these fractures. When we've answered the above questions, then we end up in one of these three categories.\\nIn each of these categories we need to determine the stage of the fracture, which tells us if the ankle is stable or unstable. In Weber A stage 1 is stable. \\nHowever when there is also a vertical or push-off fracture of the medial malleolus, then it is stage 2 and the ankle is unstable, as the ring of stability is broken in two places. I\\nn Weber B stage 2 is stable, but stage 3 and 4 are unstable. In Weber C finding a high fibula fracture means unstable stage 3. Since this fracture is usually not visible on x-rays o\\nf the ankle, you wanna study the ankle x-rays to look for stage 1 and 4, which can be a clue to image the whole lower leg to look for a high fibula fracture. These stages in Weber B\\n and C always follow a strict order.\\nThis means that when you find a stage 3 fracture, there already must be a stage 1 and 2 even if you can't see them.\\nWe will discuss these stages in the next chapter.\\nFracture stages:\\nThis is an overview of the stages of ankle fractures. It was originally described by Christian Lauge-Hansen, a Danish pathologist in 1950 and later copied by Bernhard Georg Weber in\\n 1972, a member of the AO-group. Stages of Weber A Stages of Weber B Stages of Weber C Weber B and Weber C fractures are very different in the type of fibula fracture. \\nIn Weber B there is a oblique oriented push-off fracture at the level of the syndesmosis, while in Weber C there is a twist-like fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. Notice \\nhowever, that there are many similarities between Weber B and C with only differences in the order of events. For instance a tertius fracture is either stage 3 in a Weber B or a sta\\nge 4 in Weber C fracture. Another important thing to realize is that traction on a ligament results in either a rupture of that ligament or an avulsion fracture at the insertion of \\nthat ligament.\\nStep 1 - is it a Weber A / SA:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 152}),\n",

Usually this is due to adhesions, a twist of the mesentery or internal herniation. In the large bowel it is known as a volvulus. In the small bowel it is simply known a\\ns small bowel closed loop obstruction. Especially in the small bowel the risk of strangulation and bowel infarction is high with a mortality rate of 10-35%.

              " Document(page_content=\"Disable Scroll Scroll through the images Case of small bowel obstruction Let first start with a rather difficult case and then continue with some basic knowledge about closed loop o\\nbstruction. Here we have a patient with a small bowel obstruction. So the most important question for you to answer is:\\nIs there a closed loop obstruction?Because if there is, this patient is at risk for bowel infarction and surgery is the best option. Scroll through the images. Can you find the clos\\ned loop and what is the cause? When we have a patient in the ER with what appears to be a small bowel obstruction (SBO), the most important thing we can do, besides making the diagn\\nosis, is to identify the presence or absence of strangulation. Strangulation is defined as obstruction associated with vascular compromise. The morbidity and mortality rate in the S\\nBO-group is mainly due to bowel infarction and subsequent necrosis. This is most commonly caused by a closed loop obstruction. CT is the imaging procedure of choice in the evaluatio\\nn of patients suspected of SBO. 'U' or 'C' shaped loops of bowel. Point of obstruction has a beak-like appearance The CT-presentation of a closed loop obstruction in the small bowel\\n depends on two things: If we have a short closed loop oriented within the plane of imaging, we will see a U- or C-shaped loop of bowel. Closed loop obstruction with radial array of\\n dilated loops. There is bowel wall thickening and mesenteric edema indicating ischemia Another important appearance of a closed loop obstruction is that of a radial array of dilate\\nd small bowel loops with the mesenteric vessels converging to a central point. This is almost always due to a small bowel volvulus. The findings of ischemia in closed loop obstructi\\non are the same as in patients with other causes of mesenteric ischemia: Closed loop obstruction with bowel ischemia The case on the left shows another patient with closed loop obst\\nruction. Although there is good enhancement of the vessels there seems to be a lack of enhancement of the bowel wall. Other signs of ischemia in this case are mesenteric edema and b\\nowel wall thickening. Infarcted bowel was found at operation. Closed loop obstruction presenting as a clump of bowel loops If the closed loop is longer and is oriented perpendicular\\n to the plane of section, we will see a clump of bowel loops as shown in the case on the left. Sometimes this is difficult to appreciate on just the axial images and coronal or sagi\\nttal reconstructions can be helpful. In this case there is also mesenteric edema and localised ascites in combination with dilated loops with wall thickening indicating strangulatio\\nn and risk of infarction.\\nImaging technique in SBO:\\nCT is the imaging procedure of choise in patients who are suspected for bowel obstruction. When we examine these patients, we should not give oral contrast for following reasons: In\\n some of the patients with a closed loop obstruction a bowel obstruction is not suspected. In the case on the left positive oral contrast was given. Notice the constriction in the s\\nmall bowel in figure B. Distal to the constriction in figure C we see a cluster of dilated small bowel loops not filled with oral contrast, indicating the closed loop. Only rarely c\\nontrast will pass the point of obstruction and enter the area of the closed loop. If we go back to figure B, you may already have noticed that there are two points of narrowing in t\\nhe small bowel (arrows). Therefore we have two adjacent collapsed small bowel segments representing the point of the closed loop obstruction. The bowel wall thickening, ascites and \\nmesenteric edema indicate the presence of bowel ischemia. Notice that you cannot appreciate the degree of bowel wall enhancement in the loops that are filled with oral contrast. Clo\\nsed loop obstruction and small bowel feces sign in a patient with non-dilated proximal bowel\\nSmall Bowel Feces Sign:\\nIn some of these patients with SBO the proximal small bowel proximal to the point of obstruction may not be dilated. On the left we see images of a patient in whom obstruction was n\\not suspected. This patient also received positive oral contrast. Look for the major findings and then continue. First you will notice that the small bowel is not dilated. When you g\\no down to the pelvis you see a dilated loop of bowel with inhomogeneous content and finally deep down in the pelvis there is a C-shaped dilated bowel indicating a closed loop obstru\\nction. The other important finding in this patient is the 'Small Bowel Feces Sign' (SBFS: arrow). The SBFS is a very useful sign as it is seen at the zone of transition from normal \\nto obstructed bowel and thus facilitating identification of the point and the cause of the bowel obstruction. The SBFS has been defined as gas and solid material within a dilated sm\\nall-bowel loop that simulates the appearance of feces.

First look at the image and then continue. Besid\\nes diffuse dilatation of the bowel, the major finding on this film is a large air containing structure in the pelvis. An important diagnosis to consider would be a volvulus of the c\\nolon and many would diagnose this as a sigmoid volvulus because it is located in the pelvis. However this actually is a cecal volvulus as will be explained below. Cecal volvulus can\\n go almost anywhere\\nCecal Volvulus:\\nA volvulus always extends away from the area of bowel twist. So a sigmoid volvulus can only move upwards and usually goes to the right upper quadrant. Cecal volvulus however can go \\nalmost anywhere and can even be located in the pelvis (figure). On the left there are additional CT-images of the same patient as above. First look at these images and look for the \\nmajor findings and then continue. First we see a collapsed descending colon and a non-dilated ascending colon, so this cannot be a sigmoid volvulus. Secondly, we see a beak-like str\\nucture in the right lower quadrant which is where the bowel is twisted.\\nIn the left lower quadrant we see the dilated cecum. Coronal recontructions can be very helpfull in demonstrating what is going on. On the left we see the non-dilated ascending and \\ndescending colon (straight arrows) and the transition point of the volvulus (curved arrow). Cecal volvulus is due to the cecum twisting around the ascending colon thus leading to sm\\nall bowel obstruction. A long narrow based mesentery predisposes to volvulus. An incomplete midgut rotation is a predisposing factor. Infarction is usually the result of venous cong\\nestion, while the arterial supply is rarely compromised. Cecal volvulus accounts for about 25% of cases of colonic volvulus. Dilated cecal volvulus (C) shifting away from the area o\\nf bowel twist (arrow) On the left a typical cecal volvulus is seen. We can see the beak-like transition zone located in the right lower quadrant indicating that this is a cecal volv\\nulus. The dilated cecum is located in the left upper quadrant. Also notice the collapsed descending colon posterior to the dilated cecum (curved arrow). The x-rays show a typical ce\\ncal volvulus. Notice that the dilated bowel points toward the area of twist, which is the area where you expect the cecum to be located. Continue with the CT-images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Cecal volvulus.

We can see the distended sigmoid extending from the pelvis way up into the right upper quadrant. Look at the image and decide for your\\nself why this cannot be a cecal volvulus. Then continue. The key finding is the dilatation of the proximal colon. The dilated loop seen on the left side is the dilated transverse co\\nlon. At CT we can nicely appreciate the area of the twist with the sigmoid extending up to the diafragm. The sigmoid is the commonest site of colonic volvulus. It accounts for 75% o\\nf large bowel obstruction. Sigmoid volvulus AP supine and erect radiograph of the abdomen demonstrates the characteristic coffee bean sign in sigmoid volvulus.

Treatment is done in specialized\\ncenters, but the initial diagnosis is usually made in the hospital where the\\nchild first presents. In\\nthis article we will provide tools to make the initial imaging diagnosis of the\\nmost common malignant abdominal tumors as accurate as possible. This will guide the next imaging procedures Some benign tumors which can easily be mistaken for a malignancy are incl\\nuded. Cystic abdominal masses in children are discussed here.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe most common cancers overall in children are leukemia (28%), brain and spinal tumors (26%). \\nThey are followed by tumors that mainly present as an abdominal tumor: Neuroblastoma (8%), Nephroblastoma (5%) and Lymphoma (8%) (ref). Pediatric abdominal tumors are often very lar\\nge at initial presentation, because most children come to attention because someone noted severe abdominal distention. It may seem a contradiction, but in very large tumors, it is u\\nsually more difficult to ascertain the organ of origin. The most common intra-abdominal tumors in children are: The key features of these abdominal tumors are presented in the table\\n. Ultrasound is the first imaging modality to be used. \\nIt can easily confirm that there is a mass and can often define the site of origin. Search for synchronous movement with respiration of the tumor with its organ of origin. \\nThis can be seen in smaller hepatic and renal tumors. \\nIn large tumors the surrounding organs are compressed and will show no movement. Claw sign in renal tumor In renal tumors the “claw sign” is often present.\\nThis is seen when a  part of the kidney is draped around the tumor like a claw (figure). Before we discuss the different abdominal tumors, it is good to realize that the definitive \\ndiagnosis is usually made by pathologic tissue examination. Most tumors are biopsied before treatment. \\nHowever renal tumors in children between six months and nine years are not biopsied because the likelihood of it being a nephroblastoma is so high that the risk of a wrong diagnosis\\n outweighs the risk of tumor spill during a biopsy, especially in diffuse anaplastic nephroblastoma.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",

The peak age is 2 - 3 years. Frequently these tumors present with a distended painless abdom\\nen and they are often very large at presentation. Sometimes they present with hematuria, abdominal pain or hypertension. Smaller\\ntumors are found during sonographic screening in children with syndromes which\\npredispose to nephroblastoma, like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Denys-Drash\\nsyndrome (see the webpage on renal tumors in children).

It is a highly vascular tumor. These tumors can be solitary, multi\\nple or diffuse. Most are discovered as an abdominal mass in the first six months of life. They can lead to congestive heart failure and rarely to Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, a rare d\\nisease, in which the vascular tumor leads to decreased platelet counts and bleeding disorder.\\nAFP levels are mostly normal. UltrasoundOn ultrasound a well-perfused tumor is seen. It can be hypoechoic or of mixed echogenicity. Unlike adult hepatic hemangiomas they are not ech\\nogenic. Calcifications are common.\\nLarge arteries and veins are seen and the aorta may be wider than normal due to the large demand of the tumor and tapers distal to the celiac axis.

It is the same tumor as on the ultrasound.\\nMesenchymal hamartoma:\\nMesenchymal hamartomas are usually multicystic liver lesions, although they can rarely be solid. They are often large at presentation. Serum AFP levels are normal. Ultrasound will s\\nhow a multicystic lesion. MRI will demonstrate this as well. After Gadolinium some stromal enhancement can be seen. Example 1\\nThe image is of a two-year-old boy, who presented with a painless swelling of the abdomen.

The mass was thought to be a hemangioendothelioma. \\nBiopsy was done and pathology was compatible with a mesenchymal hamartoma. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\\nHepatoblastoma:\\nHepatoblastoma is the most common malignant liver tumor in young children, while hepatocellular carcinoma presents in older children, mostly in their teens. [7].\\nHepatoblastoma usually presents with an enlarged abdomen. Ultrasound will generally show a well demarcated tumor. In larger tumors necrotic cysts and calcifications can be seen. CT \\nangiography is done preoperatively to define the relation between the tumor and the hepatic vessels. MRI will better delineate the tumor. A hepatoblastoma has low signal intenstity \\non T1 and mixed signal intensity on T2. After Gadolinium patchy enhancement is seen. Example 1A two-year-old boy presented with a swelling in the abdomen.\\nOn ultrasound a large solid tumor was seen in the upper abdomen. Some calcifications are present. The mass probably originates from the liver. It slides over the right kidney.\\nContinue with the MRI. MRI shows a solid hepatic mass with multiple small cysts. After contrast injection the mass is seen to be limited to the right posterior and anterior section,\\n bordered by the middle hepatic vein (arrow). The mass has moderate diffusion restriction. Biopsy was compatible with an epithelial hepatoblastoma. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nHepatocellular carcinoma:\\nThis disease is rare in young children but can be seen in older children, mostly >10 years of age, although it has even been reported in children of five years of age. Underlying di\\nsease which predispose to HCC include hepatitis B and Tyrosinemia. Tyrosinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by the failure to break down tyrosine, a building block of most pr\\noteins. Tyrosine and its byproducts will build up in organs and can lead to liver and kidney failure and an increased risk for HCC. The tumor presents with abdominal mass, pain, or \\njaundice. AFP levels are elevated (although usually less elevated compared to AFP levels in hepatoblastoma). Example 1A seventeen-year-old girl presented with upper quadrant abdomin\\nal pain. On ultrasound a large liver tumor was detected. \\nOn MRI a tumor in liver segment 5 and 6 is seen with satellite lesions in segment 7 and 8 (arrows). There is a tumor thrombus in the right portal vein (arrowhead), and several lung \\nmetastases (*).\\nHodgkin and Non-Hodgkin:\\nThere are two main types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma more commonly manifests with cervical lymph node enlargement and mediastinal masses\\n, while it is rarely confined to the abdomen. Non-Hodgkin is more commonly located in the para-aortic and mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen (table). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma present\\ns more frequently with extra nodal disease than Hodgkin lymphoma. For staging of Hodgkin lymphoma the Lugano classification is used  [9], and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma the Internatio\\nnal Pediatric NHL staging system [10]. Ultrasound\\nOn ultrasound enlarged lymph nodes are very hypoechoic. The almost anechoic aspect of the tumor is typical of malignant lymphoma. If the bowel is affected the layering of the bowel \\nwall is lost. MRI\\nOn MRI masses are seen with some enhancement after Gadolinium and remarkable strong diffusion restriction. Another tumor that can show this marked diffusion restriction is a neurobl\\nastoma, however these tumors are often much more heterogeneous with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage PET-CT\\n18-F-FDG PET-CT is used for staging. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Example 1This video is of a thirteen-year-old boy with cervical and mediastinal locations o\\nf a Hodgkin lymphoma. Sonographic examination of the abdomen demonstrates multiple enlarged hypoechoic paraaortal lymph nodes, which is typical for Hodgkin lymphoma. Example 2A 12-y\\near-old girl presented with a large mass in the abdomen. Ultrasound could not define an organ of origin. MRI shows a large mesenterial mass and diffuse infiltration of the omentum. \\nNotice the marked diffusion restriction of the omentum, which makes a lymphoma the most likely diagnosis. This was confirmed by pathologic examination. Sorry, your browser doesn't s\\nupport embedded videos. Example 3 A four-year-old suffered from hypertension. His kidneys were enlarged and ultrasound showed a striated appearance of the papilla and hypoechoic are\\nas in the cortex. There were also enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Pathologic examination demonstrated a Burkitt lymphoma.\\nLeukemia:\\nLeukemia is the most common malignancy in children. It can present with abdominal involvement. Leukemia can affect all solid abdominal organs.\\nThe organs can be diffusely infiltrated or have a more nodular pattern. The kidneys are affected in almost half of the patients with later stages of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It\\n can be uni- or bilateral, and there can be focal lesions or diffuse infiltration. The last has a rather typical appearance with a striated pattern around the calices, like in malig\\nnant lymphoma. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Example 1 An eight-year-old girl presented with weight loss and severe pain in the legs. \\nAn ultrasound examination had shown multiple lesions in both kidneys. \\nMRI demonstrates not only the renal tumors, but also a lesion in the pancreas, right iliac wing, left sacrum and multiple retroperitoneal lymphnodes. The diagnosis on imaging was ma\\nlignant lymphoma but the final diagnosis turned out to be leukemia.\\nGerm cell tumor:\\nThe majority of germ cell tumors in children occur in the testis and ovary, but they can arise anywhere in the body, including the abdomen. \\nThey develop from pluripotent stem cells, and therefore have variable cell lines. \\nOften a mixture of benign and malignant cell lines is found. \\nThe most malignant component on pathologic examination determines the choice of therapy. The tumor can excrete alpha-fetoprotein and / or beta human chorionic gonadotropin. \\nAbdominal germ cell tumors are diagnosed because of mass effects. \\nThe most common non-gonadal abdominal germ cell tumor is the sacrococcygeal teratoma. \\nThis entity is discussed on the page Cystic Abdominal Masses in Children. Germ cell tumors are generally part cystic and part solid. The more solid, the more malignant. [13]\\nOn ultrasound solid tumors are often very inhomogeneous with cystic and solid parts. Calcifications are common. \\nThe mixture of cystic and solid parts suggests germ cell tumor. On\\nMRI calcifications are difficult to observe because they have a variable\\nsignal on different MR sequences. They are mostly of low signal intensity and thus hard to notice,\\nbut sometimes they may have high signal on spin echo T1 and T2.  \\nMRI can demonstrate fatty components in the tumor\\nwhich strongly suggests the diagnosis of a germ cell tumor. Example 1 A four-month-old boy with an abdominal swelling. Ultrasound shows a tumor with cystic and solid parts. Some ech\\nogenic foci are present (arrow). On MRI (not shown) fatty components were visible. At operation a teratoma of the stomach was resected. It was benign.

Example 3 A sixteen-year-old girl presented with swollen legs. \\nCT demonstrates a mass with fat, coarse calcifications and solid parts. \\nThe inferior caval vein was compressed. At operation a retroperitoneal mature cystic teratoma was resected.\\nRhabdomyosarcoma:\\nRhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are the most common soft tissue tumors in children and can develop almost anywhere but mostly in the\\nhead and neck region, including the orbit and in the genitourinary tract. About 25% of all RMS arise in the lower abdomen, generally originating from the bladder, prostate or vagina\\n, but they can arise almost anywhere, for instance along the biliary tract (where no striped muscle is present!). The most common pathologic subtype is embryonal RMS, followed by al\\nveolar RMS. The\\nalveolar type has a worse prognosis. The\\nage of the patient, generally below 15 years and the location of the tumor in\\nthe prostate, bladder or vagina will point towards the diagnosis, while the imaging features are non-specific. Example 1 A fifteen-year-old boy with a tumor with a small cystic part\\n (arrow) is seen near the bladder. \\nBalloon of a catheter in the bladder. MRI A\\nsagittal image shows a tumor anterior to the bladder neck. There\\nis patchy enhancement. \\nDWI\\nshowed strong diffusion restriction (not shown).

Most images can be enlarged by clicking on them.\\nIntroduction:\\nCrohn’s disease is a chronic, recurrent inflammation of the bowel wall of unknown origin. \\nThe disease has a tendency for transmural progression with ulceration, abscesses, fistula formation, fibrosis and (intermittent) luminal obstruction. Although Crohn’s disease can in\\nvolve the entire gastrointestinal tract, colon and ileocecal region are the most frequently involved areas. Patients with Crohn's disease often have longstanding, insidious and atyp\\nical symptoms leading to serious diagnostic delay of months to even years.  \\nOn the other hand, ileocecal Crohn disease may also present acutely with appendicitis-like symptoms or small bowel obstruction. \\nIn both scenarios US can play an important role in making the correct diagnosis. Apart from primary detection, US  is also useful in:\\nNormal US anatomy:\\nThe US architecture of the normal bowel wall has a typical five-layered morphology of alternating echogenicity, closely corresponding to the histological layers of the bowel wall. T\\nhis US architecture is essentially identical from the stomach to the rectum. \\nThe normal US anatomy is outlined in the section Ultrasound of the GI tract - Normal Anatomy\\nUS signs of ileocecal Crohn’s disease:\\nBowel wall thickening:\\nIn ileocecal Crohn’s disease, typically all bowel wall layers are involved, and the normal stratification is often locally disturbed. US shows marked mural thickening, predominantly\\n in the terminal ileum, but cecum and appendix can also be involved. Bowel wall thickening is most prominent in the hyperechoic submucosal layer, representing deposition of fat and \\nfibrous tissue as a result of chronic bowel inflammation (4).

Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Using graded compression, two adjacent bowel segments are compressed against the iliopsoas muscle. The ventral segment is normal and is easily compressed, while the C\\nrohn’s loop can hardly be compressed. Measuring bowel wall thickness is best and most reproducibly performed during compression, as here in a normal individual (left) and in a patie\\nnt with Crohn’s disease (right). Measurements are performed from outer contour of the muscular layer to the opposite side, and then divided by 2, resulting in a wall thickness of 1.\\n5 mm and 6.5 mm for normal resp. Crohn ileum. \\nSee also the section Ultrasound of the GI tract - Normal Anatomy.\\nTransmural signature:\\nCommonly, at first presentation, US already reveals the characteristic transmural “signature” of Crohn’s disease. This transmural progression is recognized as focal, hypoechoic chan\\nges (*) in the otherwise hyperechoic submucosa, closely correlating with endoscopic findings and active inflammatory histologic changes (4).

Subsequent US showed the typical characteristic transmural hypoechoic changes in the hyperech\\noic submucosa confirming Crohn’s ileitis. Note the superior image resolution of US compared to CT. In patients with manifest active Crohn’s disease, the normal US architecture of th\\ne bowel wall may be lost diffusely. Note the hyperechoic fatty tissue (fat) around the ileum, representing the inflamed mesentery and omentum, trying to wall off the imminent perfor\\nation.  \\nIn cases like this, the altered morphology and luminal narrowing may mimic malignancy.\\nSkip lesions:\\nOne of the features of Crohn’s disease is the patchy way it affects bowel. \\nThis results in skip lesions,  where large parts of the bowel are left unharmed. The affected parts show a relatively sharp demarcation, the transition from normal (small arrows) to\\n abnormal bowel (large arrows) being rather abrupt.\\nUlceration:\\nBright eccentric foci within the hypoechoic areas are air-configurations representing deep ulceration, here depicted in two different patients. \\nThese transmural ulcerations herald sinus tract formation, abscesses and fistula formation.\\nNote the partially surrounding inflamed fat, representing mesentery and omentum, at this point effectively walling off the imminent perforation.\\nSinus tract formation:\\nAir-configurations reaching beyond the peripheral borders of the bowel wall definitely indicate sinus tract formation. Here an example in two different patients.\\nAbscess:\\nActively inflamed terminal ileum with a moderately demarcated hypoechoic area outside the bowel wall, surrounded by inflamed fat, indicates sinus tract and abscess formation. Enable\\n Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Two patients with Crohn’s abscesses close to the ileum. \\nNote that abscesses in Crohn’s disease are often small and collapsed. The explanation for this phenomenon  is that these abscesses usually have an open connection to the ileal lumen\\n, allowing pus to immediately evacuate to the bowel lumen when pressure goes up.\\nFistulas:\\nUltimately sinus tract formation may proceed to  fistula formation. Here two examples of entero-enteric fistulization (arrowheads). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Fistula (arrowheads) from the terminal ileum to the appendix (arrows) in advanced ileocecal Crohn’s disease.\\nNote the hyperechoic fat, surrounding the fistula complex, representing omentum and mesentery effectively walling off a possible imminent perforation to the peritoneal cavity. \\nDue to its slow and insidious character, free perforation in Crohn’s disease is very rare.

Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Ultimately sinus tract and abscess formation may result in a fistula. \\nThe most frequent targets are small bowel, sigmoid and appendix.  \\nUnusually, fistula to the bladder, the abdominal wall and iliopsoas muscle may occur. \\nIn situations with complex enterocutaneous fistula involving multiple small bowel loops, CT or MRI enterography is the ideal modality  (post-contrast T1 MRI), for pre-operative mapp\\ning and in follow-up, as in this patient. In patients with such a complex anatomy, US plays a less important role than CT and MRI. See also: Crohn's disease- Evaluation with MRI.\\nStenosis and prestenotic dilatation:\\nInflammatory bowel wall thickening or the ensuing fibrotic strictures may finally result in luminal narrowing, stenosis and bowel obstruction. \\nThe affected segment typically demonstrates dysfunctional motility.\\nIn case of acute abdominal symptoms, US can demonstrate the presence of prestenotic dilatation and therefore proves symptomatic stenosis. This young woman with known Crohn’s disease\\n had intermittent colicky attacks that were never documented with imaging. She was asked to come back immediately during an attack  to undergo US Now US demonstrated marked presteno\\ntic dilatation proximal to a short segment of abnormal ileum (arrowheads).

US reveals mucosal and submucosal thickening and hyperemia of the entire colon, which is impossible to dif\\nferentiate from ulcerative colitis. Since in every patient with suspected IBD,  repeated stool cultures are performed,  the correct diagnosis is not a problem in most cases.\\nRight-sided infectious ileocolitis:\\nIn a small group of patients, especially young adults, the bacterial infection for unknown reasons may initially remain limited to ileum and right colon. \\nThese patients present with prominent RLQ pain and have no or only mild diarrhoea. \\nThis right-sided infectious ileocolitis may therefore present with symptoms mimicking appendicitis or ileocecal Crohn’s disease, and thus may lead to unnecessary surgery. \\nUS plays an important role in the timely diagnosis. The causative bacteria are Campylobacter (80%) and Salmonella (20%). \\nIn the past, Yersinia was a frequent cause of  infectious ileitis, closely mimicking Crohn’s disease both clinically and on US. \\nHowever, the incidence of Yersinia has strongly decreased over the last three decades and is seen only very rarely nowadays.

Typical, prominent image of the ileocecal valve in infectious ileocecitis due to (sub)mucosal thickening of b\\noth ileum and cecum. The ileocecal valve is visualized in two planes, perpendicular to each other (note body scheme). As clinically observed in Campylobacter patients, pain in Campy\\nlobacter ileocecitis is often intermittent and crampy in nature. \\nDuring these crampy pain attacks (remember “Crampylobacter”), the ileum is slightly intussuscepted into the cecum, sliding back again after the attack. Differentiating Crohn’s disea\\nse and infectious ileocolitis is usually easy, as in the latter the layer structure is virtually always intact and  there is never inflamed fat, abscess or fistula formation. Differ\\nences between Crohn’s disease and infectious ileocolitis. However, differentiation of early Crohn’s disease from infectious ileocolitis, can at times be difficult to impossible. \\nFollow-up and repeated stool cultures in such cases can solve the problem. In this young patient, USfindings were compatible with both early Crohn’s ileitis and right-sided infectio\\nus ileocolitis. \\nRepeated US after 7 days waspathognomonic for Crohn’s disease. \\nNote that both wall thickening and surrounding inflamed fat have markedly increased in volume (arrowheads).\\nTuberculous ileitis:\\nIn this patient from Indonesia with  RLQ pain, the tentative US diagnosis of Crohn’s disease was made. A chest X-ray however revealed active tuberculosis, so the most likely diagnos\\nis was tuberculous ileitis. \\nFollow up US after tuberculostatic therapy showed complete resolution of the abnormalities. Tuberculous ileitis can closely mimic Crohn’s disease, and even show abscesses,  fistula \\nformation and fibrotic stenosis.\\nTyphoid ileitis:\\nThis Dutch student  presented with high fever, constipation and RLQ  pain after returning from India. \\nUS showed splenomegaly and wall thickening of the terminal ileum (arrowheads) with evident hypoechoic transmural changes (*). \\nThere was also inflamed fat around the ileum and the mesenteric lymph nodes (ln) were enlarged.

In this 52-year old man the classic appearance of an adenocarcinoma of the descending co\\nlon was found by US. \\nLongitudinal view shows a short segment ofirregular, asymmetrical, hypoechoicbowel wall thickening with loss of layer structure, especially at the ventral side. \\nNote that dorsally the wall is relatively intact.In the transverse view, the proximal segmentof colonis normal, more distally prominent hypoechoic wall thickening suggests tumor.

Concomitant wall thickening of the terminal ileum and especially the transmural changes (arrowhead) in the distal appendix, s\\nuggested the correct diagnosis of ileocecal Crohn’s disease with involvement of the appendix. An important pitfall is secondary thickening of the terminal ileum due to advanced  app\\nendicitis. \\nIn these two different patients  (who both turned out to have appendicitis),  prominent wall thickening of the ileum initially raised the suspicion of Crohn’s disease or right-sided\\n infectious ileocolitis. \\nFurther US searching brought to light that this was reactive thickening due to an underlying inflamed appendix (arrow).

This 28-year old man with a blank medical history, presented with RLQ pain si\\nnce 24 hours, suspect for appendicitis. \\nUS and subsequent CT showed a completely unexpected Crohn’s ileitis with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and a normal appendix.

MRI is helpful in determining the extent of deep infiltrating endometriosis, e\\nspecially when laparoscopic inspection is limited by adhesions. In this article we will focus on the diagnosis and preoperative assessment of endometriosis using MR imaging. You can\\n enlarge images by clicking on them. This item is not available on the iPhone application.\\nIntroduction:\\nEndometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It is mainly found in the abdominal cavity, most commonly on the surface of the ovaries. I\\nt is an estrogen-dependent disease and is estimated to occur in 10% of the female population, almost exclusively in women of reproductive age. The most common symptoms are dysmenorr\\nhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, and infertility - although it may also be asymptomatic. Click on image for enlarged view The symptoms depend on the localization of the endometriosis,\\n the depth of the infiltration and whether the endometriosis is complicated by adhesions. The illustration shows the typical localizations of endometriosis:\\nMRI-protocol:\\nIf the only reason for performing MRI is to determine the presence or extent of endometriosis, the sequences listed in the table on the left are sufficient. Lesions usually demonstr\\nate low to intermediate signal intensity on T2- and T1-weighted images. In some cases punctate foci of high signal intensity are seen on T2-weighted imaging, indicating dilated endo\\nmetrial glands. Foci of high signal intensity may be seen on T1-weighted images. If these foci also have a high signal intensity on T1-weighted images with fat saturation, it indica\\ntes the presence of hemorrhage. T1-weighted images with fat saturation are necessary to differentiate blood in endometriomas from fat in mature cystic teratomas, since both show hig\\nh signal intensity on T1-weighted images without fatsat. If the questions that need answering are more diverse, for example in cases of suspected malignancy, T1- and T1-fatsat seque\\nnces before and after the administration of intravenous gadolinium may supplement this protocol. Diffusion-weighted imaging may also be added.\\nSuperficial endometriosis:\\nSmall superficial endometriotic plaque at laparoscopy In superficial endometriosis – also known as Sampson's syndrome – superficial plaques are scattered across the peritoneum, ovar\\nies and uterine ligaments. These patients tend to have minor symptoms and usually also less structural changes in the pelvis. At laparoscopy, these implants may be seen as superfici\\nal powder-burn\\nor gunshot lesions. Coronal T2 and T1-Fatsat images: superficial serosal implants of endometriosis On MRI these lesions are most often not visible because they are tiny and flat, an\\nd therefore undetectable. Only when they exceed 5mm or when they appear as hemorrhagic cysts, showing high signal intensity on T1 and low signal intensity on T2-weigthed images, the\\ny may be detected (figure). Neither transvaginal ultrasound nor MRI are sufficiently sensitive to screen for these endometriotic plaques.\\nDeep pelvic endometriosis:\\nSagittal T2-weighted images demonstrating endometriosis infiltrating the rectum and endometriosis infiltrating the bladder In deep pelvic endometriosis - also called Cullen's syndro\\nme - there is subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial deposits. The symptoms are more severe and related to the localization and depth of invasion. MRI is of use for the diagnosis\\n of deep infiltrating endometriotic lesions and for the assessment of disease extension. Preoperative mapping of disease extension is important to decide whether surgical interventi\\non is indicated, and if so, for planning complete surgical excision. Endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac with infiltration of the rectal wall\\nCul-de-sac localization:\\nThe cul-de-sac is the most common site of pelvic involvement. Presence of deep infiltrating endometriosis in the cul-de-sac can be easily overlooked at laparoscopy due to the creati\\non of a false peritoneal floor by endometriosis in the pouch of Douglas, partly caused by anterior rectal wall adhesions. This phenomenon gives an erroneous impression of extraperit\\noneal orgin. Consequently, the location of the deep infiltrating endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum may also be a misnomer as the rectovaginal septum is located caudal to the \\nposterior vaginal fornix and, on the basis of normal anatomy, may therefore not be a primary site for endometriosis to develop. This differentiation between normal anatomy and the p\\nresence of endometriosis in the cul-de-sac is readily made using MRI. This sagittal T2-image shows deep infiltrating endometriosis in the\\nposterior cul-de-sac with infiltration of the rectal wall.\\nUterus:\\nThe torus uterinus - where the sacrouterine ligaments attach - and posterior fornix are common localizations of endometriosis. Clinically these patients often present with dyspareun\\nia. Endometriosis involving the torus uterinus T2-images of endometriosis involving the torus uterinus. Retrocervical endometriosis T2-images showing deep infiltrating endometriosis\\n in the posterior fornix and torus uterinus. There is no infiltration of the bowel wall. Endometriosis with involvement of the left sacrouterine ligament T2-weighted images demonstr\\nating involvement of the\\nleft sacrouterine ligament. Rectal endometriosis\\nBowel involvement:\\nBowel endometriosis affects between 4% and 37% of women with endometriosis. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the first line of investigation in patients with suspected bowel endometr\\niosis. Additionally, MRI can determine the depth of bowel wall infiltration, the length of the affected area and the distance of the lesion from the anus. The T2-images demonstrate \\ntwo fan-shaped hypointense lesions (red arrows). These findings are typical for endometriotic lesions infiltrating the muscular layer of the bowel wall. There is also some submucosa\\nl swelling, seen as hyperintensity on the luminal side of the bowel wall. Rectal stenosis due to endometriosis In case of circular involvement, extensive deep infiltrating endometri\\nosis of the bowel wall can lead to stenosis of the bowel lumen. Patients may clinically present with pencil-like stool or constipation. The T2-images show focal stenosis of the rect\\num as a result of circular endometriotic involvement. Bladder wall endometriosis\\nBladder involvement:\\nThe urinary tract is involved in only 4% of women with endometriosis of which around 90% involve the bladder. The T2-images show endometriosis infiltrating the bladder wall. Bladder\\n wall endometriosis The sagittal T2-image shows full-thickness bladder endometriosis with isointense signal compared to muscle and foci of high signal intensity, indicating dilated \\nendometrial glands. The fatsat T1-image shows small cysts with hyperintense signal within the lesion caused by hemorrhage. LEFT: Coronal T2WI: kissing ovaries due to adhesions RIGHT\\n: Coronal T1WI+FS demonstrating small hemorrhages (red arrows)\\nAdhesions:\\nEndometriosis is frequently complicated by adhesion formation. On MRI adhesions can be seen as spiculated, low- to intermediate\\nsignal intensity strandings on T1 and T2. Adhesions can fixate the pelvic organs, leading to posterior displacement of uterus and ovaries, elevation of the posterior vaginal fornix \\nand angulation of bowel loops. They may also lead to hydronephrosis, although in most cases hydronephrosis is caused by fibrosis secondary to the endometriosis. The T2- and fatsat T\\n1-images on the left show a patient with endometriosis in whom the ovaries are stuck together ('kissing ovaries'), as a result of extensive adhesion formation.

Blo\\nod produced by such an implant during each menstrual cycle cannot escape and will accumulate within the ovary, forming a cyst known as an endometrioma. Endometriomas present as comp\\nlex cystic masses, often thick-walled with a homogeneous content. On transvaginal ultrasound, endometriomas may be seen as thick-walled\\ncysts with low level echoes.

On MRI, endometriomas present as solitary or multiple masses\\nwith a homogeneous hyperintense signal intensity on T1- and T1-fatsat sequences. The T1-fatsat helps differentiate endometriomas from mature cystic teratomas, which usually contain \\nfat. On T2WI, endometriomas may range from having a low signal intensity (also known as shading) to an intermediate or high signal intensity. The low signal intensity reflects the h\\nemoconcentration of a cyst. Endometriomas generally have a thick, fibrous capsule with low signal intensity on T2, caused by hemosiderin-laden macrophages (figure).

Endometrial implants have been reported in many unusual sites outside the pelvis including the chest. Abdomi\\nnal wall endometriosis is the most common location of extrapelvic endometriosis and usually occurs after cesarean section. Sonography shows a solid hypoechoic lesions in the abdomin\\nal wall , frequently containing internal vascularity on power Doppler examination. These sonographic findings are nonspecific, and a wide spectrum of disorders should be considered \\nin the differential diagnosis including neoplasms such as a sarcoma, desmoid tumor, or metastasis and nonneoplastic causes such as a suture granuloma, hernia, hematoma, or abscess. \\nHowever, abdominal wall endometriosis should always be your prime concern in patients with an abdominal wall mass nearby a cesarean section scar.

It requires the coordination of nerves and muscles in the buccolabial area, the tongue, the palate, the pharynx, the lar\\nynx and finally the esophagus. Radiographic studies of patients with swallowing disorders can help to analyse the problem. In this article a systematic approach on how to analyse th\\nese videos is presented by focussing on four basic findings: Aspiration Normal Swallowing\\nNormal Swallowing:\\nLEFT: Oral or preparatory phase. RIGHT: Transport to pharynx and subsequent triggering of the actual swallowing reflex.\\nOral phase:\\nIn the oral phase food is prepared for swallowing and then transported to the pharynx. This is a preparatory phase in which the food is held within the mouth while the base of the t\\nongue and the soft palate close the oral cavity posteriorly to prevent food spilling into the open larynx and trachea. A bolus is formed in the central portion of the tongue and the\\nn pushed posteriorly toward the pharynx with an anterior-to-posterior tongue elevation. As the bolus enters the pharynx the actual swallow or pharyngeal reflex is triggered. LEFT: P\\nharyngeal constrictors push the bolus down. RIGHT: Together with the contraction of the inferior constrictor, the cricopharyngeus relaxes.\\nPharyngeal phase:\\nThis phase is a reflex action. The bolus passes through the pharynx quickly and then enters the esophagus. This takes place in less than a second.

Elevation of the soft palate prevents material from entering the nasal cavity. This st\\nage is followed by the pharyngeal constrictor muscles pushing the bolus further into the pharynx, toward the cricopharyngeal sphincter. The larynx prevents material from entering th\\ne trachea by respectively closing the true vocal cords, false vocal folds, and aryepiglottic folds. Contraction of the lower pharyngeal constrictor is followed by relaxation of the \\ncricopharyngeal muscle, allowing the bolus to pass into the esophagus.

Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll The AP-view is important to look for asymmetry. Once the series of the pharyngeal phase has been acquired, follow the contrast bolus all the way down to the gastroeso\\nphageal junction.\\nIndications for a study:\\nIndications for a swallowing study are dysphagia, globus sensation and aspiration. Dysphagia is a general term used to describe the inability to transport the food properly from the\\n mouth to the stomach.\\nGlobus sensation is a term to describe the feeling, that there is something in the throat, that is in the way or needs to be swallowed.\\nAspiration is the most severe form of swallowing disorders and can result in aspiration pneumonia, chronic lung disease or choking. In some patients with chronic lung disease a swal\\nlowing study can be performed to look for 'silent aspiration'.\\nStudy of Swallowing:\\nThe radiologist is explaining how to perform the modified valsalva First try to find out exactly what the patients problem is, so you can customize the series. Is there a risk of as\\npiration, i.e. wet voice, recurrent pneumonia or aspiration? If so, do not start the examination with barium contrast, but instead use non-ionic water-soluble contrast. If during th\\ne first few swallows there is no aspiration, you can switch to barium, as this gives better quality images. Before we start the examination, the procedure is explained to the patien\\nt and we practise certain manoeuvres like the modified Valsalva (figure). When solid food is the problem, you may want to add a solid substance to the barium - for instance biscuits\\n or bread with bariumpaste. The patient in the video only has problems with solid food. The examination of patients with a possible swallowing disorder consists of: Start with one o\\nr two lateral swallows followed by a lateral double-contrast view of the pharynx (see later). Then an AP-swallow is recorded followed by an AP double-contrast view of the pharynx. N\\next the passage through the esophagus is recorded, sometimes followed by double-contrast views of the gastroesophageal junction. Always start with the lateral view first!\\nFluorographic study of the actual swallowing:\\nThe act of swallowing is recorded on video or some sort of digital recording. We use grabs from the fluographic images and store them into the PACS-system, where we can play the ima\\nges back and forth in slow motion. It is very important to always start with the lateral view first, because if the patient aspirates, the lateral view will tell you how and why it \\nhappened. If you have to stop the examination, the most important images will already have been recorded. If you start with an AP-view and the patient aspirates, you may have to sto\\np the examination and you will never know why aspiration occurred and what the problem is. If a patient is unable to stand or sit, you can still do a lateral view. Use only a small \\namount of barium for the first swallow and if the patient is doing fine, coninue with larger portions. Aspiration of a small amount of barium is usually not a big problem, but you d\\non't want a lot of barium filling the bronchi. LEFT: Lateral view during singing aaa. Hyoid (H) and tongue base (T) move anteriorly. Left and right pyriform sinuses are projected on\\n top of each other. Tip of soft palate (SP) is seen. RIGHT: Valleculae (V) and pyriform sinuses (P).\\nDouble contrast images of the pharynx:\\nFor the lateral view, ask the patient to sing an aaa, as this will move the tongue in an anterior position and give a better view on the oro- and hypopharynx. In Dutch this will be \\nthe letter eee, as it is pronounced the same as the english aaa. For the AP-view the modified Valsalva manoeuvre is performed. The patients has to blow air through the tightened lip\\ns as in trumpet-playing, while relaxing the neck region. Always practise this manoeuvre prior to the examination, so the patient knows what to do. On the left DC views of the pharyn\\nx. Outpounching of the lateral wall of the pharynx is normal and can be quite severe (Dizzy Gillespie). These are called 'lateral pharyngeal ears'. Cricopharyngeal hypertrophy in a \\npatient with reflux.\\nExamination of the esophagus:\\nAlways follow the passage of barium through the esophagus until it enters the stomach. Disorders of the gastroesophageal junction are often experienced as a problem within the throa\\nt. The rationale for this is that in patients with a distal obstruction, gastroesophageal reflux or a motility disorder, the cricopharyngeal muscle has to work very hard to prevent \\nfoodspillage back into the pharynx - along with the risk of aspiration. This increased muscle tone gives the patient the sensation that there is something in the throat. The images \\nare of a patient with globus sensation. This was due to severe reflux and subsequent increased tone of the cricopharyngeal muscle. A large paraesophageal hernia with reflux is the c\\nause of the complaints. Optimal views of gastro-esophageal junction when air regurgitates from the stomach into the coated esophagus in a patient with a sliding hiatus hernia. Excel\\nlent views of the gastroesophageal junction can be achieved by doing the following: You get the best lighting, when the anterior part of the cervical spine is in the middle of the i\\nmage. Do not put the contrast bolus in the center of the image, because on the video you'll get a constant shift of images that are too dark to images that are too bright.\\nAnalyzing swallowing studies:\\nA simple way to analyse a swallowing study is to concentrate on four easily detectable findings: These findings are mostly already apparent during the examination, but analysis of a\\nll the images will clarify the mechanism that causes these abnormal findings. These imaging findings may be isolated findings or may be related to each other. For instance, prematur\\ne closure of the cricopharyngeal muscle may lead to stasis of contrast in the pharynx, which may result in aspiration as the larynx opens at the end of swallowing. Asymmetric swallo\\nwing due to head turn. The head is turned to the left and contrast is only seen in the right food channel.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 170}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Asymmetry:\\nAsymmetric swallowing on an AP-view is usually the result of an asymmetric tilting of the epiglottis. Sometimes it is caused by rotation of the head, but in many cases no real expla\\nnation is found. Even when the head is not rotated, the epiglottis can tilt asymmetrically when it hits the posterior pharyngeal wall. This is more likely to occur when only a small\\n bolus is given, as the pharynx will not fully distend. A larger bolus will result in a symmetric swallow. In the case on the left rotation of the head closes the side to which the \\nhead is turned (Figure). If a patient has a unilateral pharyngeal paresis, turning of the head towards the affected side will help the patient in preventing aspiration. By turning t\\nhe head towards the affected side, this side will be closed preventing stasis on this side and possible secondary aspiration. However before you decide that it is a normal finding y\\nou have to exclude a pharyngeal tumour or unilateral paresis. The double-contrast views can be helpful in these cases. In unilateral paresis the paralysed side will protrude during \\nthe modified Valsalva. When a tumour is present in the pharynx, it is usually visible on the DC views. Sometimes endoscopy is necessary to solve the problem of an asymmetric swallow\\n. Asymmetry (2) The case on the left is an odd case, but it nicely demonstrates the difficulty that sometimes exists in determining the cause of asymmetry. On the far left asymmetry\\n is seen on the fluorographic study (green arrow). It looks as if there is something in the right pyriform sinus. On the double contrast view on the right the pyriform sinus is norm\\nal (green arrow), but at the level of the vallecula on the right a lobulated proces is seen (yellow arrow). At a higher level a smooth indentation of the oropharynx is seen (blue ar\\nrow). The lobulated tumor at the level of the valleculae proved to be remnants of the lingual tonsil, which is a common finding and sometimes difficult to differentiate from cancer \\nof the tongue base. Continue with the CT of this patient. Impression of the oropharynx by an elongated internal carotid artery (blue arrow.). Compare to the position of the carotid \\nartery on the left The CT image shows that the smooth indentation of the oropharynx on the right was caused by an elongated internal carotid artery. So indeed this is an uncommon ca\\nse in which on the fluorographic study a tumor was suspected in the pyriform sinus. Finally a proces was found within the oropharynx and a proces compressing the wall from outside a\\nt a higher level. Due to these processes there was an asymmetric passage of contrast in the hypopharynx simulating a proces in the pyriform sinus. Here another patient with an elong\\nated internal carotid artery. This patient had swallowing problems and at inspection a pulsating structure was seen in the oropharynx. This is not un uncommon finding. So before you\\n perform a biopsy in this area make sure that you are not dealing with the carotid artery. Stasis of contrast at the level of the pyriform sinuses (blue arrows) with subsequent aspi\\nration (yellow arrows)\\nStasis:\\nStasis is the result of insufficient cleansing of the pharynx, either due to an obstruction- i.e. dysfunction of the cricopharyngeus or tumor or due to insufficient contraction of t\\nhe pharyngeal constrictors. Insufficient contraction is the result of pharyngeal paresis resulting from a neuromuscular disorder. Excessive movements of the tongue base and larynx a\\nre sometimes seen on lateral fluorographic studies to compensate for the loss of function of the pharyngeal constrictors. When the patient resumes breathing, aspiration can occur (F\\nigure). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Stasis (2) Here a set of images demonstrating a patient with a paresis of the pharynxconstrictors. This is usually associated with insufficient relaxation of the cric\\nopharyngeal muscle. In this example we can see how the patient tries to compensate for the loss of pharyngeal constriction by excessive movement of the tongue and the head. This pat\\nient is in extreme stress, because he knows that when he starts breathing and the throat is not empty, he will aspirate. In some of these cases cricopharyngeotomy is the only soluti\\non to facilitate the passage of food to the esophagus. Small impression of the cricopharyngeus. No obstruction.\\nCricopharyngeal Dysfunction:\\nInsufficient opening and premature closure are the most common problems of the cricopharyngeal muscle. Normally you should not see an impression of the cricopharyngeus during passag\\ne of the bolus, but a small non-obstructive indentation is sometimes seen and is not clinically significant (Figure). It can however sometimes explain the symptoms of the patient. I\\nt is assumed that the passage of food irritates the mucosa that covers the cricopharyngeal muscle resulting in a globus sensation. LEFT: small pouch. MIDDLE and RIGHT: true Zenker's\\n diverticulum due to premature closure of the cricopharyngeus (yellow arrow)\\nZenker's diverticulum:\\nA Zenker's diverticulum is always the result of cricopharyngeal dysfunction. Premature closure of the cricopharyngeus results in an increased pressure in the hypopharynx, just above\\n the cricopharyngeus, as the pressurewave of the pharyngeal constrictors pushes the bolus downwards. This increased pressure can result in an outpouching at a weak spot in the poste\\nrior pharyngeal wall (Killian's dehiscence). First this will result in a small pouch, that in time can increase and form a true Zenker's diverticulum (Figure).

The digital recordings nicely demonstrate the filling of a large Zenker's diverticle. The contraction of the lower pharyngeal constrictors is indicated by the blue arrow. The c\\nontraction of the lower pharyngeal muscle against the closed cricopharyngeal muscle causes the posterior outpouching, just above the contracted cricopharyngeal muscle (yellow arrow)\\n. Cricopharyngeal dysfunction (4) Here a video of a patient with a Zenker diverticulum. Notice that on the AP-view the patient keeps on swallowing because of the globus sensation. A\\nspiration before, during or after the actual swallow.\\nAspiration:\\nThere are three instances when aspiration can occur: before, during or after the actual swallow. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Aspiration before swallowing When tongue or soft palate are unable to prevent spillage of food into the pharynx, aspiration may occur since the larynx is still open. \\nWeakness of these muscles in the mouth and the throat is due to paralysis or myopathy. We have to assume that a failure of the sensory nerves in the pharynx is the problem. Notice a\\nlso that there is no coughing reflex. This patient probably has silent aspiration. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Aspiration during swallowing This is due to an insufficient closure of the larynx when it should be closed. Closure of the larynx is a result of anterosuperior liftin\\ng of the larynx which allows the true cords, false cords and finally, the aryepiglottic folds to contract, followed by a backwards folding of the epiglottis over the closed larynx. \\nThe aryepiglottic folds are the main gatekeepers, while the epiglottis plays only a minor role in preventing aspiration. Both failure of these intrinsic muscles of the larynx as wel\\nl as failure of the extrinsic muscles (i.e. muscles that lift the larynx) may lead to aspiration during swallowing. Weakness of the extrinsic muscles is seen after radiotherapy, in \\nneurologic disorders and in recurrens nerve paralysis (i.e. neuromuscular dysfunction). Notice that this patient has diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) with syndesmofyt\\nes at many levels on the anterior side of the cervical spine. However they are not the cause of the swallowing disorder.

              " Document(page_content=\"ce the swallowing reflex is initiated, the larynx closes properly, but contrast is already in. Notice also that while the contrast enters the larynx, it does not initiate a cough re\\nflex. Althoug the digital recording perfectly explains the complaints of the patient, it is difficult to say what causes this problem. Usually when there is aspiration during swallo\\nwing, the problem is at the level of the larynx. Mostly it is the larynx that is unable to close either due to weakness of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles or weakness of the extrins\\nic muscles that lift the larynx and allow it to contract (for instance after neck radiation or surgery). In this case the problem is probably at the level of the sensory nerves in t\\nhe pharynx, who are not triggered properly. You could also argue, that this maybe is aspiration before swallowing, because it happens before the actual swallowing reflex. Maybe a mo\\nre forcefull push of the bolus posteriorly from the mouth into the oropharynx could help in triggering these nerves instead of allowing the bolus to slide over the back of the tongu\\ne. Aspiration after swallowing This is the most common cause of aspiration. It is the result of stasis of contrast in the pharynx due to insufficient contraction of the pharyngeal c\\nonstrictors or insufficient opening of the cricopharyngeal muscle or an obstructing web or tumor. When the larynx opens the contrast may leak into the trachea. The patient in the vi\\ndeo aspirates due to stasis in the hypopharynx. In this video there is massive aspiration due to stasis as a result of insufficient contraction of the pharyngeal constrictors and in\\nsufficient opening of the cricopharyngeal muscle.\\nWeb:\\nWebs are mucosa folds which are usually located anteriorly in the hypopharynx or upper esophagus. Liquids usually pass well, but in many cases a 'jet' is seen. The passage of solid \\nfood may produce irritation or damage to the mucosa, resulting in a globus feeling. They are best diagnosed on the lateral projection of the barium swallow. Here another example of \\na web. Webs are frequently overlooked at esophagoscopy unless special attention is given to this area. During esophagoscopy they may rupture, but in many cases recurrence is seen.\\nPharyngeal ears:\\nOutpounching of the lateral wall of the pharynx are called 'lateral pharyngeal ears'. Sometimes patients complain of globus sensation or that small food particles or pills get stuck\\n in their throat, but usually it is an incidental finding. They can be quite prominent as in Dizzy Gillespie the famous trumpet player. Two cases of pharyngeal ears.\\nOsteofytes:\\nAlthough osteofytes can be quite big, they hardly ever cause swallowing problems.\\nEsophagus pathology:\\nAs mentioned earlier problems in the esophagus can give the sensation of a problem in the throat. In the video there is stasis of contrast in the proximal esophagus due to a large c\\narcinoma. A common cause of swallowing problems is reflux which irritates the cricipharyngeal muscle and results in hypertrophy. The patient in the video has a large hiatal hernia w\\nith reflux and almost no peristatic movements in the esophagus. Here three patients with swallowing problems as a result of esophageal pathology. The patient on the left has reflux \\nesophagitis with a Barrett's esophagus. The patient in the middle has a esophageal cancer. The patient on the right has a stricture due to ingestion of caustic material.\\nLingual tonsils:\\nThe lingual tonsils are nodules of lymphatic tissue at the back of the base of the tongue (yellow arrow). They are similar to the adenoid or nasopharyngeal tonsil (blue arrow). Larg\\ne lingual tonsils can be a cause of dysphagia or globus sensation especially if the tonsils compress the epiglottis. In many cases however they are incidental findings. Endoscopy is\\n sometimes needed to differentiate large tonsils from a carcinoma at the tongue base. Notice that you have to look carefully to detect the large lingual tonsil.\\nDiagnosis:\\nThe results of the swallowing examination help in establishing a final diagnosis. Based on this examination alone however, a specific diagnosis usually cannot be made, since most se\\nvere swallowing disorders are the result of a complex neuromuscular dysfunction. Hence the swallowing study should be regarded as part of the total evaluation of the patient by gast\\nroenterologist, neurologist and speech therapist. The strength of the fluoroscopic examination is, that it is the only examination that can show us, what is really going on during s\\nwallowing and can therefore lead to a rehabilitation plan.\\nSwallowing Rehabilitation:\\nSwallowing rehabilitation is a specialty on its own. Here we will make some brief comments on rehabilitation as it may help you to better understand the dynamics of swallowing. In u\\nnilateral pharyngeal paralysis stasis can be prevented by closing down one of the lateral food channels by turning the head towards the affected side or by manually compressing it. \\nPatients with aspiration before swallowing due to insufficient closure of the mouth, can be helped by flexing their head during chewing and thus holding the food in the anterior par\\nt of the oral cavity. In patients with aspiration during or after swallowing the 'supraglottic swallow' may help. Before swallowing a deep breath is taken. Air is prevented to leak \\nout of the airways by compressing the vocal cords. Immediately after swallowing the patient has to cough forcefully in order to clear the airways and the throat from any residual fo\\nod. Some patients only aspirate when they ingest fluids. These patients can be helped by changing their fluid intake into jelly-like liquids. by Nam-Jong Paik\\n3.

Using a dedicated MRI-protocol, it is possible to detect an\\n epileptogenic lesion in 80 percent of these patients. Resection of these lesions can lead to seizure freedom in many patients. We will discuss the MRI protocol and the typical find\\nings in the most common epilepsy-associated diseases.\\nIntroduction:\\nCommon causes of Epilepsy:\\nThe illustration summarizes the most common causes of seizures in patients with medically uncontrollable epilepsy. Some of these lesions are readily identifiable. Meso temporal scle\\nrosis and focal cortical dysplasia are the most common causes and can only be depicted with a dedicated protocol. The table also summarizes epileptogenic lesions that are detected i\\nn patients with uncontrollable seizures. Mesial temporal sclerosis is the most common cause of intractable epilepsy. In medication refractory epilepsia the most common location of t\\nhe epilectogenic lesion is temporal lobe (60%), frontal lobe (20%) and parietal lobe (10%), periventricular (5%) and occipital (5%).\\nSeizures and Epilepsy:\\nSeizures are common. About 4 percent of all people will have at least one seizure during their lifetime. In patients with a first ever seizure imaging will mostly show no brain-abno\\nrmalities, because the seizure is provoked by fever, drugs, dehydration or sleep deprivation. The term epilepsy is used, when there are recurrent unprovoked seizures. About 60 perce\\nnt of patients with epilepsy can be controlled with antiepileptic drugs. Most patients with uncontrollable seizures have complex partial seizures. Partial seizures - also called foc\\nal seizures - are seizures which affect only a part of the brain at onset. They usually start in the temporal lobe. In simple partial seizures the person remains conscious. A simple\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 172}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' partial seizure can be a precursor to a larger seizure and then it is called an aura. A complex partial seizure affects a larger part of the hemisphere and the person may lose cons\\nciousness. If a partial seizure spreads from one hemisphere to the other this will give rise to a secondarily generalised seizure. The person will become unconscious and may have a \\ntonic clonic seizure.\\nMRI epilepsy protocol:\\nThe table shows a dedicated epilepsy protocol. Some will also use Inversion Recovery and not use contrast on a routine base. T1WI\\nSuperior for cortical thickness and the interface between grey and white matter. On T1WI look for grey matter occuring in an aberrant location as in gray matter heterotopia.\\nFLAIR Look very carefully for cortical and subcortical hyperintensities on the FLAIR, which can be very subtle. Since FLAIR may show false-positive results due to artefacts, the abn\\normalities should be confirmed on T2WI. \\nT2* or SWI Helpful when searching for haemoglobin breakdown products as in posttraumatic changes and cavernomas, or to look for calcifications in tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber, c\\navernomas and gangliogliomas.\\nMesial temporal sclerosis:\\nMesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is a specific pattern of hippocampal neuronal loss accompanied by gliosis and atrophy. The etiology is unknown, but there is a relationship between M\\nTS and prolonged febrile seizures earlier in life, complicated delivery and developmental processes. In 15% of patients another developmetal abnormality can be found, mostly focal c\\nortical dysplasia. This is called dual pathology. MTS is the most common cause of partial complex epilepsy in adults and is also the most common etiology in young adult patients und\\nergoing surgery. Surgical removal of visible MRI changes associated with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis leads to seizure freedom in up to 80% of cases. Right-sided mesial temp\\noral sclerosis Coronal T2W and FLAIR images are the most sensitive for detecting MTS. On axial slices mesial temporal sclerosis is commonly overlooked. Bilateral mesial temporal scl\\nerosis is difficult to detect due to the lack of comparison with the unaffected contralateral hippocampus. The coronal T2WI and FLAIR images show right-sided mesial temporal scleros\\nis. Notice the volume loss, which indicates atrophy and causes secondary enlargement of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. The high signal in the hippocamous reflects glios\\nis. Dual pathology: MTS and focal cortical dysplasia Mesial temporal sclerosis may occur in association with other pathology, especially focal cortical dysplasia. This is called dua\\nl pathology. The images show mesial temporal sclerosis with a hyperintense and shrunken hippocampus (red arrows), and secondary enlargement of the left temporal horn of the left lat\\nerale ventricle. Also notice associated subcortical hyperintensity in the left temporal lobe indicating focal cortical dysplasia. Left mesial temporal sclerosis. Subtle gliosis of l\\neft hippocampus (blue arrow) and atrophy (yellow arrow). 35-year-old patient with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. MR shows subtle hyperintensity of the left hippocampus on the ax\\nial FLAIR (blue arrow) and atrophy of the left hippocampus on coronal images (yellow arrow). Left mesial temporal sclerosis treated with amygdalo-hippocampectomy The patient was suc\\ncesfully treated with amygdalo-hippocampectomy on the left.\\nDifferential of hippocampal hyperintensity:\\nHippocampal hyperintensity on T2WI or FLAIR images with volume loss is diagnostic for mesial temporal sclerosis in the appropriate clinical setting. Hippocampal hyperintensity witho\\nut volume loss is seen in: Status epilepticus. Axial FLAIR, axial DWI and coronal T2WI. Status epilepticus The imaging findings in status epilepticus can mimick mesotemporal scleros\\nis. In status epilepticus a hyperintense hippocampus can be seen, but there is swelling and no atrophy. Axial FLAIR, axial DWI and coronal T2WI demonstrate a hyperintense hippocampu\\ns with a slightly compressed temporal horn of the lateral ventricle consistent with hippocampal edema. DWI shows diffusion restriction due to cytotoxic edema in the acute stage of t\\nhe status epilepticus. Hyperintense hippocampus due to a DNET DNET mimicking mesial temporal sclerosis Axial T2WI shows hyperintense, but enlarged hippocampus with a bubbly appearan\\nce. This is typical for a DNET or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, which we will discuss in a moment. The coronal contrast-enhanced T1WI shows an enlarged hippocampus without\\n uptake of contrast medium.\\nFocal Cortical Dysplasia:\\nkey findings Focal cortical dysplasia is a congenital abnormality where the neurons fail to migrate in the proper formation in utero. MRI findings may be very subtle or may even be \\nnegative, therefore a high index of suspicion is mandatory! The most common findings are cortical or subcortical hyperintensities especially seen on FLAIR-images. These are often fo\\nund at the bottom of a deep sulcus. Another finding is a blurred interface between grey and white matter, because the white matter looks a little bit like gray matter because it con\\ntains neurons that did not reach the cortex. Focal cortical dysplasia - coronal T1WI and FLAIR The images show typical focal cortical dysplasia. There is cortical thickening and blu\\nrring of the grey/white matter junction on T1WI (left). The FLAIR image on the right shows the subcortical hyperintensity. Dual pathology: MTS and focal cortical dysplasia The image\\ns demonstrate cortical and subcortical signal abnormalities on T2WI and FLAIR in the left temporal lobe indicating focal cortical dysplasia. Notice associated T2/FLAIR hyperintense \\nand shrunken hippocampus as a result of mesial temporal sclerosis, i.e. dual pathology. Focal cortical dysplasia. Coronal T2WI Another case of focal cortical dysplasia. Notice the h\\nypoplastic left temporal lobe with cortical thickening (arrow) and atrophy of the white matter. Focal cortical dysplasia.

The FLAIR-images also show high signal in the subcortical whi\\nte matter. These findings are typical for focal cortical dysplasia. Focal cortical dysplasia in the right occipital lobe with transmantle sign\\nTransmantle sign:\\nSometimes the hyperintensity is seen extending from the subcortical area to the margin of the ventricle. This is called the transmantle sign. This finding represents the arrested ne\\nuronal migration. Images of a 27-year-old male with refractory occipital lobe epilepsy. Coronal FLAIR and axial T2WI show T2-hyperintense cortical thickening and high signal in cort\\nex and subcortical region. Notice subcortical hyperintensity extending to the right ventricle indicating transmantle sign (blue arrow). Focal cortical dysplasia - Transmantle sign. \\nTransmantle sign seen in another patient with focal cortical dysplasia.\\nCortical and glial scars - Ulegyria:\\n54-year-old patient with a history of perinatal asphyxia and longstanding refractory partial epilepsia. Left parietal scar in the parasagittal watershed area resulting in a shrunken\\n cortex. Cortical and glial scars usually result from meningitis or birth injury. Ulegyria is a specific type of scar. It is defined as cerebral cortex scarring due to perinatal isc\\nhemia. Ulegyria typically affects full term infants. In these infants there is greater perfusion to the apex of the gyri than to the cortex at the depth of the sulci. The resulting \\npattern is that of a shrunken cortex in which the deep portions of the gyri are more shrunken than the superficial portions, leaving pedunculated gyri on long stalks with a mushroom\\n appearance. Ulegyria must be differentiated from microgyria. Ulegyria MR will shows tissue loss and gliosis underneath a shrunken cortex. The shrunken cortex is best appreciated on\\n a 3D-T1WI because of its high resolution and the superior delineation of the cortex, while FLAIR will show the hyperintensity associated with the gliosis. Therefore always use the \\nFLAIR-sequence to search for hyperintensities in an epileptic patient and subsequently correlate these findings with the cerebral cortex in the affected area on high resolution T1WI\\n.\\nCavernoma:\\nCavernoma is also known as cavernous malformation or cavernous angioma. It is a benign low flow vascular malformation with a tendency to bleed. 75 percent occur as solitary sporadic\\n lesions and 10-30 percent occur as multiple lesions. Cavernomas consist of locules of variable size that contain blood products in different stages of evolution which produces a po\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 173}),\n",

Some patients have lymphangioleiomatosis, a cystic lung disease seen in women. The classic clinical triad is focal epilepsy, adenoma sebaceum and mental retardation (mnemon\\nic: fits, zits and nitwits). The cortical hamartomas are called tubers and are similar to cortical dysplasia. Subependymal nodules are small lesions protruding into the lateral vent\\nricles. Sometimes they are calcified. Seizure surgery in TSC is contemplated if a particular tuber can be implicated in seizure activity, or if a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma\\ns obstructs the foramen of Monro causing hydrocephalus.

A red\\n hot foot in a patient with diabetic neuropathy is a diagnostic problem. In this overview we will focus on two questions: Is this a Charcot foot with superimposed infection? Overvie\\nw\\nOverview:\\nOsteomyelitis versus Charcot:\\nOsteomyelitis: Osteomyelitis in a diabetic with neuropathy is infection of the bone that usually results from contiguous spread of a skin ulcer. Consequently, the most common locati\\non for osteomyelitis is not in the midfoot, but at the pressure points of the forefoot (metatarsal heads, IP joints) and in the hindfoot at the plantar aspect of the posterior calca\\nneus. To determine whether osteomyelitis is present, place a marker on the ulcer or sinus tract and track it down to the bone and evaluate the MR- signal intensity of the marrow (1)\\n. Active Charcot: Unlike osteomyelitis, Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is primarily an articular disease, which is most commonly located in the midfoot. In the early stage radiograp\\nhy will not demonstrate bone abnormalities, but MRI will show subchondral bone marrow edema. The subcutaneous soft tissues are not typically involved. Signal intensities on MRI will\\n not discriminate between active Charcot Joint and osteomyelitis. Location, i.e. bone or joint and ulcer or not, are the clues to the right diagnosis. Chronic stage of Charcot:The c\\nhronic stage of Charcot no longer shows a warm and red foot, but the edema usually persists. Joint deformity, subluxation and dislocation of the metatarsals lead to a rocker-bottom \\ntype deformity in which the cuboid becomes a weight-bearing structure. The deformity of the foot with abnormal pressure distribution on the plantar surface coupled with reduced or l\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 175}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='oss of sensation, makes the foot vulnerable and leads to callus and blister formation aswell as foot ulceration. Charcot with superimposed osteomyelitis: Foot ulceration can subsequ\\nently lead to infections, such as cellulitis and osteomyelitis, and this may eventually lead to amputation. The simplest method to determine whether osteomyelitis is present is to f\\nollow the path of an ulcer or sinus tract to the bone and evaluate the signal intensity of the bone marrow (1). Osteomyelitis in chronic Charcot is usually located in the midfoot, w\\nhile osteomyelitis in diabetic neuropathy without Charcot is usually in the forefoot and hindfoot.\\nOsteomyelitis:\\nWhile diagnosing osteomyelitis is important, it is unfortunately also difficult. Clinical and laboratory signs and symptoms are generally unhelpful. The clinical diagnosis relies on\\n the identification and characterization of an associated foot ulcer, a method that is often unreliable. It is important to mark the skin or subcutaneous abnormality, i.e. ulcer or \\nsinus tract and to find its relation to the area of bone abnormality. The probe-to-bone test, i.e. palpation of bone with a sterile blunt metal probe in the depths of infected pedal\\n ulcers was thought to be highly correlated with ostemyelitis. In later studies, however, it had a relatively low positive predictive value (7). On plain radiographs, bone infection\\n may not show up on the first 2 weeks and in a later stage the radiographic characteristics of neuro-osteoarthropathy and osteomyelitis overlap. In both cases there will be deminera\\nlization, destruction and periosteal reaction of the bones, particularly when neuro-osteoarthropathy presents at a later stage. Here, images of a patient with a small cutaneous defe\\nct and subcutaneous edema at the metatarsals. A secondary sign, an abscess, is shown in the forefoot, with high signal intensity on STIR, low or intermediate signal on intensity T1W\\n, and ring-enhancement of the borders showing high signal intensity on T1+Gd.\\nCharcot neuro-osteoarthropathy:\\nAcute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy of the midfoot Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is a degenerative disease with progressive destruction of the bones and joints. It is seen in pati\\nents with neurological disorders with sensory loss of the feet, including tabes dorsalis, leprosy, diabetic neuropathy, and other conditions involving injury to the spinal cord. In \\n1868 Jean-Martin Charcot gave the first detailed description of the neuropathic aspect of this condition in a patient with syphilis. Today, diabetes mellitus is the most common etio\\nlogy associated with Charcot osteoarthropathy, with the joints of the foot and ankle being most commonly affected. Here an illustration with the key MR-features of acute Charcot neu\\nro-osteoarthropathy: Chronic stage of Charcot osteoarthropathy The exact nature of Charcot arthropathy is unknown. The neurotraumatic theory states that Charcot arthropathy is cause\\nd by an unperceived trauma to an insensate foot. The sensory neuropathy renders the patient unaware of the osseous destruction that occurs with continuous ambulation. The neurovascu\\nlar theory suggests that the underlying condition leads to the development of autonomic neuropathy, causing the extremity to receive an increased blood flow, which in turn results i\\nn a mismatch in bone destruction by increased osteoclastic activity and bone synthesis (1). The image shows a progressive neuro-osteoarthropathy of the tarsometatarsal joints (Lisfr\\nanc dislocation) with subchondral cysts, erosions, joint distention and dislocation. A hot red foot in acute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy\\nAcute Charcot:\\nAcute active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is defined by clinical signs. There should be neuropathy and a warm and swollen foot. The skin temperature should be 2?C or more at the s\\nite of maximum deformity of the affected foot compared with a similar site on the contralateral foot. Osteomyelitis should be excluded and fever is not present. Serum C-reactive pro\\ntein level is normal or only a slightly elevated. The differential diagnosis is infection (osteomyelitis, cellulitis, septic arthritis), inflammation (gout, rheumatoid arthritis) an\\nd deep vein thrombosis. In this early stage, radiographic abnormalities are not present. The acute stage of Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy shows rapid and progressive bone and joint\\n destruction within days or weeks. Immobility by total contact casting can prevent further bone and joint destruction. Here a radiograph of a patient with diabetic neuropathy and a \\nred hot foot. In the acute stage, the radiographs are normal and may not exclude the diagnosis of acute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy. Within 4 months there is progressive decrease\\n of calcaneal inclination with equinus deformity at the ankle. There is destruction of the tarsometatarsal joint with the typical rocker-bottom deformity. Bony debris is seen on the\\n dorsal aspect of the foot. In the acute stage, MRI shows only subchondral bone marrow edema. Here MRI images of a patient with acute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy. The bone marrow\\n edema typically is not restricted to one or two bones, but is seen in the entire midfoot. Bone marrow edema and its enhancement are typically centered in the subchondral bone, sugg\\nesting articular disease. The subcutaneous tissues are relatively normal and there is no ulcer or other signs of infection.\\nChronic Charcot:\\nThe chronic inactive stage no longer shows a warm and red foot. The edema usually persists. Crepitus, palpable loose bodies and large osteophytes are the result of extensive bone an\\nd cartilage destruction. Joint deformity, subluxation and dislocation of the metatarsals lead to a rocker-bottom type deformity in which the cuboid becomes a weight-bearing structur\\ne. This results in excessive skin callus formation, blisters and foot ulceration. At the stage of chronic inactive Charcot osteoarthropathy, bone healing and change of active perios\\nteal reaction will proceed into inactive periosteal reaction and sclerotic borders. The classic radiographic description of neuro-osteoarthropathy is that of the five D\\' s. Debris m\\nay be present and effusions may decompress along fascial planes, carrying bony debris far from the joint. Dislocation is the result of ligamentous laxity. On the far left, a normal \\nradiograph in the acute stage of Charcot. Subsequently progressive Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is seen with dislocation of the Lisfranc joint.\\nCharcot with superimposed osteomyelitis:\\nTo determine whether osteomyelitis in a Charcot foot at MR imaging is present, follow the path of an ulcer or sinus tract to the bone and evaluate the signal intensity of the bone m\\narrow. If there is bone marrow edema, osteomyelitis is very likely. If there is bone marrow edema in the absence of a cutaneous defect, active Charcot may be present. If it is norma\\nl, both active Charcot as well as osteomyelitis is not likely.

Abnormal pressure on the cuboid has led to ulceration. STIR and T1W images in Charcot neuro-osteoa\\nrthropathy with a plantar ulcer (asterix) and osteomyelitis of the cuboid. In a patient with Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy and a rocker-bottom foot, the cuboid bone is an important\\n location of osteomyelitis. If the T1-weighted image at that location shows low signal intensity in combination with a cutaneous defect, osteomyelitis is extremely likely. On the le\\nft STIR and T1-weighted images of a patient with active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy with a plantar ulcer along the bony protuberance of the cuboid. There is abnormal signal inten\\nsity in the cuboid bone next to the ulcer, indicative of osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis in chronic Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy Here the contrast enhanced images with and without fa\\nt saturation. Enhancement of the cuboid bone and adjacent soft tissues on postcontrast images, together with the plantar ulcer, makes osteomyelitis very likely. No osteomyelitis in \\nchronic Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy On the left a patient with Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy with a subcutaneous fistula tract (arrow). This patient has subcutaneous edema and s\\nwelling. When we follow the fistula tract to the bony protuberances of the cuboid, there is no marrow edema at the midfoot. This makes yet osteomyelitis unlikely. Ghost sign The gho\\nst sign is indicative of neuro-osteoarthropathy with superimposed osteomyelitis. The \"ghost sign\" refers to poor definition of the margins of a bone on T1-weighted images, which bec\\nome clear after contrast administration. Here, a patient with neuro-osteoarthropathy and superimposed osteomyelitis. The areas of osteomyelitis are more pronounced on the contrast-e\\nnhanced T1-weighted image as compared to the native T1-weighted image. The bone marrow edema, which is of low signal intensity on the T1-weighted image without contrast enhances and\\n becomes as bright as normal bone marrow.\\nMRI protocol:\\nThe MRI examination includes special attention for positioning of the foot. It must be placed in the center of the magnet, to obtain homogeneous fat suppression. Markers have to be \\nplaced over ulcers or sinus tracts. T1 and STIR or T2 fatsat sequences are needed. Because of the curvature of the foot, fat suppression is more uniform with the use of STIR than wi\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 176}),\n",

As an alternative to spectral fat saturation technique, Dixon ch\\nemical shift imaging is described (8). Sagittal views are for evaluation of midfoot involvement, the plantar surface and the posterior calcaneus. A view parallel to the toes is adeq\\nuate for imaging the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Contrast is used to better depict devitalized regions, abscesses, sinus tracts and joint or tendon involvement. \\nby Andrea Donovan, MD and Mark E.

Interactive cases are presented in the m\\nenu bar to test your knowledge. by David Rubin and Robin Smithuis\\nNormal Meniscal Anatomy:\\nMedial meniscus: The posterior horn is always larger than the anterior horn.\\nMedial meniscus:\\nBoth horns are triangular in shape and have very sharp points. The posterior horn is always larger than the anterior horn (figure). If this is not the case, then the shape is abnorm\\nal, which can be a sign of a meniscal tear or a partial meniscectomy. LEFT: normal medial meniscal root immediately anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament. RIGHT: missing poste\\nrior root due to meniscal root tear. The posterior root is immediately anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament. If it is missing on the sagittal images, then there is a meniscal\\n root tear (figure). The anterior horn has an insertion on the tibia and a second portion that travels from medial to lateral to connect to the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus\\n (intermeniscal or transverse ligament). Lateral meniscus. Both horns are about the same size.\\nLateral meniscus:\\nOn sagittal images the posterior horn is higher in position than the anterior horn. Both horns are about the same size. Lateral meniscus: posterior horn and posterior meniscal root.\\n The lateral meniscus posteriorly comes up high over the tibial spine to insert near the posterior cruciate ligament. This upward position of the posterior horn may be the reason fo\\nr the higher signal intensity of the posterior horn in all planes due to magic angle effect.\\nMeniscal tears:\\nCriteria for tears:\\nThe two most important criteria for meniscal tears are an abnormal shape of the meniscus and high signal intensity unequivocally contacting the surface on PD images. High signal int\\nensity not unequivocally contacting surface. Small black line on inferior margin of the meniscus. At arthroscopy the meniscus was normal. It is a misunderstanding that menisci shoul\\nd be homogeneously low in signal intensity on proton-density images. The meniscus does not have to be black. Only when the high signal unequivocally reaches the surface of the menis\\ncus you can make the diagnosis of a tear. If there is doubt whether the high signal touches the surface, look at all the adjacent images. If there is still doubt, then do not diagno\\nse a tear. If you have a questionmark in your head, say \"meniscus is normal\". (figure) Basic shapes: Longitudinal, Horizontal and Radial.\\nNomenclature of Meniscal Tears:\\nShapes. There are 3 basic shapes of meniscal tears: longitudinal, horizontal and radial. Complex tears are a combination of these basic shapes. Bucket handle, Horizontal Flap tear a\\nnd Parrot beak. Displaced Tears Bucket-handle tear = displaced longitudinal tear. Flap tear = displaced horizontal tear. Parrot beak = displaced radial tear.\\nLongitudinal, horizontal and radial tears:\\nLongitudinal tears Longitudinal tears parallel the long axis of the meniscus dividing the meniscus into an inner and outer part. Therefore, the distance between the tear and the out\\ner margin of the meniscus is always the same (figure). The tear never touches the inner margin. Three sagittal images of a longitudinal tear Longitudinal tears follow the collagen b\\nundles that parallel the contour of the meniscus. If a longitudinal tear has other components (horizontal or radial), then it is a complex tear violating the collagen bundles. This \\nrequires a higher energy trauma. LEFT: abnormal shape of posterior horn. A piece is missing. RIGHT: displaced fragment in the intercondylar fossa. Longitudinal tear (2) Bucket handl\\ne tear is a displaced longitudinal tear. LEFT: meniscus is abnormal in shape and there is a displaced fragment. RIGHT: Three structures in the intercondylar fossa: post cruciate lig\\n (1), ant cruciate lig (2) and displaced fragment (3). On coronal images bucket handle tears are easier to recognize. Normally there are only two structures in the intercondylar fos\\nsa: the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament. Any other structure in the intercondylar fossa is abnormal and a displaced meniscal fragment is the most likely possibility. More o\\nn Bucket handle tears Flipped meniscus: posterior horn is missing because it is flipped over and located on top of the anterior horn. Longitudinal tear (3) Flipped meniscus is a for\\nm of bucket handle tear. There is a capsular detachment or peripheral tear of the meniscus, usually the posterior horn. The posterior horn flips over onto the anterior horn. More on\\n Flipped meniscus Horizontal tear with a meniscal cyst Horizontal tears Horizontal tears divide the meniscus in a top and bottom part (pita bread). If horizontal tears go all the wa\\ny from the apex to the outer margin of the meniscus, they may result in the formation of a meniscal cyst. The synovial fluid runs peripherally through the horizontal tear and accumu\\nlates within the meniscus and finally result in a cyst. The connection with the joint space is often lost, so they will not fill with contrast on MR-arthrography. The synovial fluid\\n is absorbed and is replaced by a gelatinous substance. There are 3 criteria for the diagnosis of a meniscal cyst: The diagnosis of a meniscal cyst is important to the surgeon becau\\nse it takes one operation on the outside of the knee to remove the cyst and another operation on the inside for the meniscus. Radial tears Radial tears are perpendicular to the long\\n axis of the meniscus. They violate the collagen bundles that parallel the long axis of the meniscus. These are high energy tears. They start at the inner margin and go either parti\\nal or all the way through the meniscus dividing the meniscus into a front and a back piece. Radial tears are difficult to recognize. You have to combine the findings on sagittal and\\n coronal images to make the diagnosis. LEFT: triangle missing the tip.RIGHT: disrupted bow tie. The following combination of findings is diagnostic: In one plane: triangle missing t\\nhe tip and in the other plane: a disrupted bow tie. Disrupted bow tie indicating a small radial tear. Small radial tears are difficult to diagnose. Sometimes the only sign is a disr\\nupted bow tie. LEFT: Absent or empty meniscus on sagittal image.RIGHT: Axial image shows complete radial tear leading to a defect in the meniscus. If you image a complete radial tea\\nr directly along the length of the tear you will see an absent or empty meniscus. These complete radial tears open up and give the impression that there is a part missing. However y\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 177}),\n",

More on empty meniscus sign Meniscal root tear: on sagittal images there is an absent \\nor empty meniscus-sign adjacent to the posterior cruciate ligament where the meniscal root should be. On coronal images a meniscal root tear is confirmed.\\nMeniscal root tear:\\nA meniscal root tear is a radial tear located at the meniscal root. Normally when you image the posterior cruciate ligament on sagittal images you should see a considerable portion \\nof the posterior horn of the meniscus on that image or the image adjacent to it. If this is not the case it is an absent or empty meniscus-sign, indicating a radial tear. More on me\\nniscal root tears\\nPost-operative meniscus:\\nPost-operative menisci are harder to evaluate because the two most important criteria, i.e. abnormal signal and abnormal shape, do not apply. Abnormal signal is no longer a reliable\\n sign of a tear, because if there has been a suture repair, this will heal with scar tissue, which also has high signal on PD-images (figure). Although an uncommon finding, if there\\n is also high signal on T2-weighted images, then you can make the diagnosis of a tear, as this is the result of synovial fluid leaking into a meniscal tear. This however is an uncom\\nmon finding. Abnormal shape can be the result of partial meniscectomy. So you need to know what procedure was performed during arthroscopy. Only when comparison is made with prior p\\nostoperative images, can you determine, if an abnormal shape is a new finding indicative of a new tear. Sometimes differentiation between normal post-op findings and a re-tear is no\\nt possible on conventional MR-images. In these cases, MR-arthrography with 40cc diluted Gadolinium helps to make the distinction because even small amounts of Gadolinium that leak i\\nnto a tear are readily visible on fat saturated T1 images. PD and T2W images. Prior partial meniscectomy and suture repair. At arthroscopy, there was no tear. Post-operative Meniscu\\ns 1 The case on the left shows a meniscus with an abnormal shape aswell as abnormal signal touching the surface on PD but not on T2W-images. This patient had a prior partial menisce\\nctomy and a suture repair. On the basis of these imaging findings, it is impossible to tell if this is a tear or a normal postoperative finding. This patient had another operation f\\nor ACL reconstruction. The surgeon looked at the meniscus and the meniscus was found to be normal i.e. no tear. LEFT: Old MR exam with tear. Patient had a suture repair. RIGHT: On n\\new exam, there is a new tear (yellow arrow). It is not possible to tell if the old tear has healed. Post-operative Meniscus 2 This patient had a suture repair for meniscal tear. The\\nre was a new injury. On the new MR, it is impossible to determine if the old tear had healed. However a new tear is seen, so this case is easy. MR-arthrogram: In the new tear the si\\ngnal is as bright as in the synovial fluid (yellow arrows). In the healed tear the signal is not as bright. On an MR-arthrogram, there was very high signal intensity in the new tear\\n comparable with the synovial fluid, but only moderate signal intensity at the healed old tear. So comparison with the old films was diagnostic for the new tear, while the arthrogra\\nm showed that the old tear has healed. PD and MR-arthrogram after suture repair for meniscal tear: healed tear. Post-operative Meniscus 3 This patient also had a suture repair for m\\neniscal tear. After a new injury, the PD-images show high signal unequivocally reaching the surface of the meniscus (seen on the original films, but not clearly seen on the compress\\ned image on the left). On this image, it is not possible to tell if the tear has healed. So an MR-arthrogram was performed which showed that the tear has healed.\\nNone:\\nNone:\\nBreast Implants:\\nNormal imaging findings and complications:\\nEsteban van Keulen, Saskia Fuchs, Maud Hegeman and Robin Smithuis\\nDepartment of Radiology of the Tergooi MC hospital in Hilversum, University Medical Center Utrecht and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2022-04-05 Breast augmentation surgery is the most popular cosmetic surgery procedure worldwide.\\nThe number of women who have breast implants for augmentation or reconstruction is increasing. The risk of rupture increases with the age of the implant and is seen more often in re\\nconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer than in implants for cosmetic augmentation. In this review we will focus on the role of imaging in describing normal and abnormal fin\\ndings of common implants. This review is based on a presentation given by Saskia\\nFuchs, Esteban van Keulen en Maud Hegeman during the Sandwich course of the Radiological Society of the Netherlands in\\nfebruari 2021.\\nIntroduction:\\nLocation and type of implant:\\nAbout 80% of breast implants are for cosmetic augmentation, while about 20% are for breast reconstruction following mastectomy.\\nBreast implants consist of a silicone outer envelope and a silicone or saline filling. Capsule\\nAll breast implants will become encapsulated. This can start within weeks to years after implantation. \\nIt is a physiological foreign body reaction of fibrous tissue that will form around the implant. Breast implants are placed: Arros indicate the pectoral muscle Subpectoral implant\\nIn this technique, the pectoralis major muscle is elevated from the chest wall.\\nPalpability\\nof the edges of the implant will be lower in general.\\nMammograms are usually less distorted compared to the prepectoral group. Prepectoral implantIn the prepectoral technique, the implant is placed in front of the pectoral muscle poste\\nrior to the glandular tissue.\\nRippling is observed as the most common complication.\\nMammograms are somewhat more distorted. The location of the implant in relation to the pectoral muscle is best recognized on the oblique views. Saline filled implant and a silicone \\nfilled implant which is cut to show the form-stable content. Silicone filled implantsThe most used breast implants consists of an outer silicone elastomer envelope and an inner fill\\ning of silicone gel.\\nThe silicone filling has evaluated over the years into a more form-stable mass (figure). Saline filled implantsSaline filled implants also have a silicone outer envelope. They\\ncan be primarily used for cosmetic augmentation or\\nused\\nas breast tissue expanders in reconstructive surgery as a temporary device and gradually filled with saline. Saline filled implants are more prone to trauma\\nresulting in immediate deflation. Breast implants may be round or anatomically pre-shaped. \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 178}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='The surface of the envelope can be smooth or textured including a polyurethane covering to prevent the implant from turning.\\nSome implants have a patch, which is a textured area on its surface to keep the implant in place or as a palpable orientation mark for the surgeon. * Must be considered as an uncert\\nain finding if it is only seen as a single sign on a single image (which is uncommon).\\nImaging findings:\\nThis table summarizes normal and abnormal findings in breast implants. When the droplet-, noose- or keyhole sign is seen as a single sign on a single image, which is uncommon, then \\nit must be considered as an uncertain finding. The Linguine sign is most specific for intracapsular rupture. Normal findings Capsular calcifications\\nCalcifications can be found in about 25% of the breast implants. The incidence of capsular calcifications increases with age of implants. These calcifications do not indicate ruptur\\ne, although associated with some degeneration of the envelope. EffusionA\\nsmall amount of periprosthetic fluid is frequently seen and is almost always normal.\\nHowever\\nit still can be a seroma, hematoma or infection and must be correlated to\\nclinical symptoms. There is no absolute diameter that should be interpreted as\\nabnormal. Comparing\\nwith the contralateral implant can be helpful. Folding\\nPalpable folds can occur especially in prepectoral implants with a superficial location in women with few surrounding tissue. These folds can be impressed and pop back at physical e\\nxamination. Folding is a normal finding. Capsular calcifications. Possible intracapsular rupture of the breast implant on the right. On this axial CT-image there is\\ncapsular thickening with severe capsular calcifications. On the right side there also is an irregular content and some\\nlinear lines, which is suspicious for intracapsular rupture. Degenerative changes Capsular contraction The\\nincidence of contraction of the capsule is up to 25% in 10 years and is seen\\nmore often in breast reconstruction than in cosmetic breast augmentation. The capsule\\nwill become\\nthick and hardens, the\\nimplant shape will usually become rounder and less compressible. Droplet sign\\nThe droplet sign and inhomogeneous content are degenerative changes that may indicate intracapsular rupture, but are not definitive proof of rupture. Intracapsular rupture An intrac\\napsular rupture occurs when the shell of the implant ruptures but the fibrous capsule formed by the breast remains intact. \\nSilicone does not freely extravasate, but is stuck between the capsule and the envelope. \\nThis makes it difficult to detect on clinical exam or mammography. There are many signs described that indicate intracapsular rupture, but it all comes down to silicone between the \\ncapsule and the envelope.\\nIntracapsular rupture is best seen on MRI. Teardrop signIt is a focal invagination of the silicone envelope where the two walls do touch. A small amount of silicone is within the te\\nardrop, which means that it is outside the envelope. Keyhole sign\\nAlso known as nose-sign. It is a focal invagination of the silicone envelope where the two walls do not touch. A small amount of silicone is within the keyhole and outside the envel\\nope. Linguine sign\\nThe ruptured envelope appears as curvilinear lines that look like Linguine pasta. These signs of intracapsular rupture need to be differentiated from normal folding which may contai\\nn some fluid, which is normal periprosthetic fluid (figure). Extracapsular rupture In extracapsular rupture the silicone from the ruptured implant migrates freely beyond the envelop\\ne and the fibrous capsule into the surrounding breast tissue. Capsular calcifications and extracapsular rupture (arrow) In 2019 the mammogram shows extensive capsular calcifications\\n and a very round shape of the breast implant.\\nThis indicates a contracture of the implant. At follow up in 2020 the contour has changed and now there is silicone beyond the capsule, which is a definitive sign of extracapsular r\\nupture (arrow). This elderly patient did not not want surgery, but only wanted screening for possible malignancy. In 2022 at follow up exam not much has changed. Modern Silicone gel\\n is more cohesive and has less tendency to spread.\\nReporting:\\nWhen you examine the patient with ultrasound, mention the degree of evaluability.\\nThe condition of the implant can be obscured by capsular calcifications or the posterior border can be hard to see in big volume of implant. No Bi-Rads classification in the MRI rep\\nort as the protocol is not able to\\ndetect breastcancer.\\nUltrasound:\\nEnvelope (yellow arrow) and capsule (white arrow) anterior to the envelope\\nNormal findings:\\nSmall effusions are commonly seen.\\nThey have a different signal intensity than Silicone and should not be confused with the keyhole sign. The T2W-image shows an effusion\\nfilling the virtual space between the envelope and the capsule. This is a\\nnormal finding. The T1W-image shows a hypointens\\nthickened capsule. The capsule will show hypointense on any sequence. The contour of the implant is more\\nrounded, which indicates capsular contraction. Although signs of contraction can be well seen on\\nimaging, the degree of contraction is estimated by physical exanination. Normal radial folds Radial folds are infoldings of the envelope extending from the surface into the gel cont\\nent. \\nThis is also a normal finding.\\nThe content within the fold-lines should not contain Silicone. Normal radial folds More normal radial folds. Normal radial folds Here more examples of normal infolding of the envelo\\npe.\\nThere is no silicone content within these folds.

              " Document(page_content='However there should be more signs to consider a possible rupture.\\nFolding:\\nFolds are seen in many forms. They are dynamic. \\nWhen turning outwards they are sometimes palpable, especially at the edges of the breast implant and at locations where there is little tissue between the implant and the skin. Thes\\ne folds are normal findings. Radial folds Deep linear or curved lines within the implant can be hard to call. Are they inner radial folds or part of a collapsed envelope as a result\\n of intracapsular rupture? Try to look for more signs and follow the line to look for continuity with the envelope. In some cases MRI is needed to solve this problem.\\nIntracapsular rupture:\\nWhen there is silicone within a fold, then it is a sign of intracapsular rupture. The images show: Here another example of the different presentations of intracapsular rupture with \\nsilicone outside the envelope, but within the capsule.\\nStepladder sign:\\nUS can detect intracapsular rupture by identifying a series of horizontal echogenic straight or curvilinear lines, somewhat parallel, traversing the interior of the implant, commonl\\ny known as the “stepladder sign”. It is important not to confuse the stepladder sign with normal prominent radial folds. Images\\nMore examples of the “stepladder sign”. Stepladder sign in a patient with extreme capsular calcifications. In this patient heavily capsular calcifications did obscure the condition \\nof the prosthesis. \\nHowever when looking from a different angle it was obvious that there was a stepladder sign indicating rupture. Due to the widespread calcifications, it was not sure whether it was \\nonly an intracapsular rupture or also some extracapsular leakage of Silicone. Intracapsular rupture A. The envelope can no longer be found around the surface of the implant. The inn\\ner content is complete inhomogeneous and degenerated. B. The envelope is collapsed (yellow arrow) and does not follow the outer envelope-capsular complex (white arrow). \\nThere is an inhomogenous collection between the envelope and the capsule containing Silicone. .\\nExtracapsular rupture:\\nThis woman has an extracapsular rupture on the right with silicone outside the thickened capsule (white arrow). In the left breast there is an intracapsular rupture indicated by the\\n subcapsular line with silicone on both sides of the line (yellow arrow). Another example of extracapsular rupture with silicone outside the capsular border. Residual Silicone after\\n explantation This patient had bilateral removal of the breast implants.\\nOn the right there is high signal of silicone material in lymph nodes (white arrow). On the left there is residual silicone anterior and posterior to the major pectoralis muscle (ye\\nllow arrow) and also within the muscle. When a new silicone prosthesis is implanted, this residual silicone should not be interpreted as extracapsular leakage of the new implant.\\nMRI:\\nProtocol:\\nMRI is the gold standard for evaluation of the integrity of the breast implant with a sensitivity of 80-90% and specificity of 90-97% for detecting ruptures. It has a high spatial r\\nesolution and the ability to suppress or enhance the signal of Silicone, water and fat.\\nA combination of sequences can be used to detect complications. \\nGadolinium i.v. is not needed. T2W-images\\nThese are best for studying the anatomy and provide high resolution. They also give information about lymph adenopathy. Silicone-only-imagesThese are STIR-images, in which fat is su\\nppressed, combined with water suppression. As a result there is only signal of the silicone material. This sequence is ideal for studying rupture of the envelope and detecting silic\\none outside the envelope or outside the capsule. Water-only-imagesA combination of fat saturation and silicone suppression gives information about fluid collections within or around\\n the prosthesis.\\nLinguine sign:\\nThis is the most reliable sign of intracapsular rupture.\\nThe curvilinear lines which are formed by the ruptured envelope resemble Linguine pasta.

BIA-ALCL develops primarily if not exclusively in patients with textured implants.\\nThe estimated prevalence in these implants is 1:30.000. \\nMost BIA-ALCL were seen in Allergan Biocell textured breast implants and they were subsequently taken off the market. Two-thirds of individuals with\\nBIA-ALCL present with discomfort and swelling due to the development of\\nperiprosthetic effusion (85%) in which atypical lymphoid cells are found. Sometimes associated with a mass in 15% of cases. Any late onset unilateral effusion or mass should be punc\\ntured and analyzed. Staging is with PET-CT, like in any other lymphoma. Most patients present with Stage 1.\\nThe treatment is surgical excision of the implant, capsule and mass if present. Outcome is\\nfavorable when early treated.\\nX-Ray and CT:\\nChest X-Rays and CT do not play a role in examining breast implants. Sometimes they can be detected on X-rays for instance when there are capsular calcifications or when a  filling \\nvalve of an expandable prosthesis is seen (arrow). Also on CT sometimes complications can be seen, but usually CT does not give adequate information about the integrity of the prost\\nhesis.

Imaging of breast implants—a pictorial review Insights Imaging. 2011 Dec; 2(6): 653–670.\\nSella Turcica and Parasellar Region:\\nWalter Kucharczyk and Marieke Hazewinkel\\nRadiology department of the University of Toronto, Canada and the Radiology department the Medical Centre Alkmaar, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2008-08-10 This review is based on a presentation given by Walter Kucharczyka and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Marieke Hazewinkel. In this review a sys\\ntematic anatomic approach to differential diagnosis of a sellar or parasellar mass is described. By clicking on one of the subjects in the list on the left, you will go directly to \\nthis item. If you have printing problems with the margins of the document, you may have to adjust the margins in the page set up of your internet browser, which you will find in the\\n top left of the menu bar.\\nAnatomic Approach to Differential Diagnosis:\\nIn order to analyze a sellar or parasellar mass on MRI we use the following anatomic approach: Pituitary gland On a coronal section through the brain the reference structure is the \\npituitary gland which lies in the sella turcica. It is usually larger in females than in males - in females the superior border tends to be convex, whereas in males it is usually co\\nncave. The most common abnormalities that arise in the pituitary gland are pituitary adenoma, Rathke's cleft cyst and craniopharyngioma. Pituitary stalk The next structure to identi\\nfy is the pituitary stalk. This is a vertically oriented structure which connects the pituitary gland to the brain. It is thinner at the bottom and thicker at the top. Embryological\\nly, it is also derived from Rathke's cleft epithelium and therefore the pathologies, which can arise in the pituitary gland can also arise in the stalk. There are a few unusual thin\\ngs to be considered in children, such as germinomas and eosinophilic granulomas. In adults metastases and occasionally lymphoma can arise in the pituitary stalk. Optic chiasm Anothe\\nr major structure in the suprasellar cistern is the optic chiasm. It is an extension of the brain and looks like the number 8 lying on its side. It is glial tissue - therefore the m\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 181}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"ost common tumors to originate here are gliomas. In the US and Europe another frequent pathology in this region is demyelinating disease - particularly multiple sclerosis. This can \\nalso be associated with some swelling of the optic chiasm. Hypothalamus Further cephalad lies the base of the brain, which at this location is the hypothalamus. Anatomically the hyp\\nothalamus forms the lateral walls and floor of the third ventricle. The most common pathologies to arise here are gliomas - in children hamartomas, germinomas and eosinophilic granu\\nloma. Carotid artery A very important structure in this area is the internal carotid artery. It runs a complex anatomic course as it passes through the skull base shaped like an S o\\nn lateral views. It passes through the cavernous sinus. The segment cranial to this is known as the supracavernous segment. This bifurcates into the anterior cerebral artery, which \\npasses cranially to the optic chiasm, and the middle cerebral artery, which runs laterally. Aneurysms and ectasias are pathologies that can arise here. One must also be aware of con\\ngenital variations in the course of the internal carotid Sometimes it is very medially positioned and can actually lie in the midline. Cavernous sinus The cavernous sinus is a paire\\nd complex of venous channels. In the lateral wall of the sinus run nerve III (oculomotorius), IV (trochlearis), V1 and V2 (trigeminus). The sixth cranial nerve (abducens) runs more \\nmedially and is located caudal to the carotid artery. The most common pathologies occurring in the cavernous sinus include schwannomas arising from the cranial nerves and inflammati\\non, which can lead to thrombosis. This is known as cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis. Carotid-cavernous fistulas are fistulous communications between the carotid artery and the veins\\n of the cavernous sinus. Meninges The meninges cover the cavernous sinus. They are thicker laterally and superiorly than medially and inferiorly. The most common tumor to arise from\\n the meninges is of course the meningioma. Dural metastasis is the second most common tumor to arise here. Also inflammatory pathologies occur in the basal meninges - the most commo\\nn infection being tuberculous meningitis. Of the non-infectious inflammatory pathologies sarcoidosis is the commonest. Sphenoid sinus Inferior to the pituitary gland lies the spheno\\nid sinus. This structure contains air and is lined by mucosa and bone. Posterior to the sphenoid sinus lies the clivus (not shown on this coronal section through the brain). Patholo\\ngy that arises in this area includes carcinomas arising from the mucosa of the sphenoid sinus - squamous cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are the most common. Chordomas a\\nrise in the clivus and chondrosarcomas and osteosarcomas also occur in this area. Metastases can occur anywhere. Bacterial or fungal inflammatory processes in the sphenoid sinus can\\n spread intracranially via the cavernous sinus.\\nPituitary Microadenoma:\\nPituitary Microadenoma By definition, pituitary microadenomas are less than 10 mm in diameter and are located in the pituitary gland. These images show a classic case: on T1 a lesio\\nn about 3-4 mm in diameter, slightly hypointense compared to normal pituitary tissue, located in the pituitary gland. On T2, the lesion is slightly hyperintense. The differential di\\nagnosis: pituitary microadenoma or Rathke's cleft cyst (the two can be indistinguishable). The sensitivity of an unenhanced MRI scan for detecting pituitary microadenomas is about 7\\n0%. It is not always necessary to give intravenous contrast for detecting pituitary microadenomas as patients with a negative scan generally receive the same symptomatic treatment a\\ns patients with a microadenoma (usually these patients are women with symptoms of hyperprolactinemia). The purpose of the scan is to rule out any large lesions. In possible surgical\\n candidates (for example patients with failed medical therapy or pituitary disease not amenable to medical therapy such as Cushing's disease) it is necessary to give contrast to loc\\nalize the lesion as accurately as possible. On an unenhanced scan, approximately 70% of all pituitary microadenomas can be detected. If you give gadolinium, you can reduce the false\\n-negative rate from 30% to 15%. As mentioned earlier, this usually does not affect patient management. Coronal T1 and T2-weighted images and T1-weighted images before and after gado\\nlinium. In this patient the lesion in the pituitary gland is only detectable after the administration of intravenous contrast. The differential diagnosis: pituitary microadenoma or \\nRathke's cleft cyst.\\nPituitary Macroadenoma:\\nBy definition, pituitary macroadenomas are adenomas over 10mm in size. They tend to be soft, solid lesions, often with areas of necrosis or hemorrhage as they get bigger. As they gr\\now, they first expand the sella turcica and then grow upwards. In this example of a pituitary macroadenoma there is suprasellar extension with elevation and compression of the optic\\n chiasm. Because they are soft tumors, they usually indent at the diaphragma sellae, giving them a 'snowman' configuration. This is one feature that can help distinguish between a p\\nituitary macroadenoma and a meningioma. Another feature which can help differentiate them is enlargement of the sella turcica - this generally only occurs with pituitary macroadenom\\nas that originate in the sella. On the left another example of a pituitary macroadenoma. The lesion starts in the sella, which is enlarged, and extends into the suprasellar cistern.\\n Note the classic 'snowman' configuration caused by constriction by the diaphragma sellae. Notice the blood-fluid level, indicating hemorrhage. The usefulness of observing the incli\\nnation of the diaphragmatic leaflets was referred to earlier. On the T2-weighted images on the right you can see that the leaflets are displaced upwards by this macroadenoma which s\\ntarted in the sella and is growing upwards. A lesion originating above the sella and growing downwards would push the leaflets in the other direction (this can be seen with meningio\\nmas for example). Usually the diagnosis of a macroadenoma is straightforward. Sometimes a meningioma can give a similar appearance. On the left an example of a meningioma. Note ther\\ne is no diaphragmatic constriction and there is uniform enhancement after the administration of intravenous gadolinium which is typical of meningioma. These images are of a transsph\\nenoidal resection of a pituitary macroadenoma. After the bony floor of the sella turcica has been removed, the dura is incised with a cruciate incision. Because the pressure above t\\nhe dura is larger than the pressure below, the macroadenoma then delivers itself into the sphenoid sinus. Intra-operative MRI was performed in an experimental setting to determine w\\nhether the neurosurgeon had successfully removed all of the tumor. Because using this surgical approach means a limited field-of-view, it is important to know beforehand what it is \\nyou are operating on. As we will see there are lesions you do not want to operate using this approach! Another common pathway of extension is laterally into the cavernous sinus. It \\nis not always possible to tell if there is cavernous sinus invasion, but there are three signs to look out for:\\n-Is there more than 50% encirclement of the carotid artery? Note: meningiomas tend to constrict the carotid artery, macroadenomas do not.\\n-Is there lateral displacement of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus compared to the opposite side?\\n-Is there an increased amount of tissue interposed between the carotid artery and the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus? At medical school they teach you that a rare manifestation\\n of a common lesion is more likely than a rare abnormality. Since pituitary adenomas are the most common lesions of the skull base, it is prudent to always include them in the diffe\\nrential diagnosis if you can not identify a normal pituitary gland when confronted with a mass in this region. This patient presented with nasal obstruction. She went to an ENT spec\\nialist who saw a large endonasal mass and she was referred to the neurosurgeon for planned major skull base resection. The neurosurgeon had seen something similar before, and checke\\nd her prolactin-level. This was 4000 (25 or less is normal). Endonasal biopsy revealed prolactinoma. After treatment with bromocriptine the mass shrunk down and no surgery was neces\\nsary.\\nRathke Cleft Cyst:\\nRathke's cleft cyst is the second of three pathologies derived from Rathke's cleft epithelium. The cyst is fluid-filled and has very thin walls with a thickness of only one or two c\\nell layers. This is illustrated by the microscopic image. These walls can contain cells which secrete fluid, allowing the cyst to grow and compress adjacent structures. Rathke's cle\\nft cysts can occur either in or above the sella turcica. On the images above there is a normal pituitary gland, a normal optic chiasm and a normal carotid artery on each side. The p\\nituitary stalk is not identifiable, however, due to a round mass in this area. The mass has a high signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-images. Now the only two things that are thi\\ns bright on unenhanced T1-weighted images are either fluid (blood or proteinacious fluid) or fat. Solid masses are not this bright. Therefore it is most likely a cystic structure or\\niginating from the pituitary stalk, probably a Rathke's cleft cyst. A cystic craniopharyngioma is also in the differential diagnosis.\\nThese images illustrate the importance of unenhanced T1 images. They allow you to appreciate that the abnormality is located in the pituitary stalk alone. If you were only presented\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 182}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\" with images after the administration of intravenous contrast, you might think the pituitary gland was abnormal as well. These T1, T2 and T1-weighted images after gadolinium demonst\\nrate another Rathke's cleft cyst located in the pituitary gland. Unlike the normal pituitary tissue and pituitary stalk it does not enhance after the administration of intravenous c\\nontrast. The normal pituitary tissue is compressed and displaced far to the left. It is important to recognize this as it could be mistaken for an enhancing component of the cystic \\nmass. In general, all extra-axial masses , i.e. masses outside of the brain like the pituitary gland and stalk, will enhance because they do not have a blood-brain barrier. If you h\\nave a non-enhancing extra-axial mass, there are three possibilities:\\nCraniopharyngioma:\\nCraniopharyngioma is the third of the three pathologies derived from Rathke's cleft epithelium. Technically these are benign tumors, but unlike Rathke's cleft cysts, they have thick\\n walls and are locally invasive. Macroscopically, it is a complex mass with multiple nodules at the base of the brain, sinuating along the fissures. Often, it can not be completely \\nresected. The picture on the right shows a thick-walled cyst as part of the craniopharyngioma. In over 50% of cases craniopharyngiomas have a pathognomonic appearance. On these unen\\nhanced and enhanced T1-weighted sagittal images, a compressed pituitary gland can be identified. There is a large intrasellar and suprasellar mass with cystic and enhancing componen\\nts as well as calcifications. These findings in a child are virtually pathognomonic for craniopharyngioma (perhaps with only a dermoid in the differential diagnosis). Coronal images\\n of the same mass. And axial images. Unenhanced CT shows the calcifications more clearly. After intravenous contrast the total extent of the lesion and its cystic components are muc\\nh less evident.\\nMeningioma:\\nThe most common intracranial tumor in adults is the meningioma with 20% of occurring at the skull base. This is an autopsy specimen with the brain removed, showing a meningioma sitt\\ning on the diaphragma sellae. Meningiomas are almost always solid lesions, sometimes with a cyst on the edge. They can lift up the arachnoid a little bit and enhance uniformly as a \\ngeneral rule. On the top-left unenhanced and enhanced CT-images, the main differential diagnosis of the enhancing mass would include meningioma, pituitary adenoma and an aneurysm. T\\nhe post-constrast MR-image on the top-right rules out an aneurysm as a possible diagnosis (no flow void), but on axial images a pituitary adenoma and meningioma are still difficult \\nto differentiate. Notice the spread of the lesion along the meninges. The epicentre of the lesion is above the sella. Meningioma. T1WI and T1WI-postcontrast On the coronal images (T\\n1 and T1-postcontrast), a compressed pituitary gland can be identified at the bottom of the sella turcica. Above it lies a large mass, partially intrasellar and partially suprasella\\nr. Although the diaphragma sellae can not be identified on these images, it is probably a suprasellar mass growing downwards. When pituitary macroadenomas get this size they usually\\n have areas of hemorrhage or necrosis - in mengiomas this is less often the case.\\nAneurysm:\\nThis is an important case to keep in mind. This patient is a woman in her late forties, who presented to her family doctor with galactorrhea. The family doctor did a number of tests\\n, including a determination of her prolactin level. This was about 150 (25 or less is normal). Thinking the patient had a pituitary adenoma, the family doctor ordered this CT scan. \\nIt is easy to get tunnel vision when reporting on a scan like this as a radiologist when the clinical information includes hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea. Of course your first \\nthought is a pituitary adenoma. If you look at the location of the lesion however (partially in the sella turcica and partially in the cavernous sinus), there are other possibilitie\\ns, including a meningioma or an aneurysm. The radiologist reported this as a pituitary adenoma, and the patient was treated with bromocriptine. The bromocriptine had no effect, and \\nthe patient went to a neurosurgeon for a surgical opinion. The neurosurgeon ordered this MRI. The lesion partly in the right cavernous sinus and partly in the sella turcica is predo\\nminantly black on this T1-weighted image. In general there are three things that are black on MRI: air, bone and rapid blood flow. In this case it is black due to rapid blood flow i\\nn a carotid aneurysm. This is the corresponding angiogram. Obviously, this is not a lesion to be operated on transsphenoidally! Hypothalamus hormones either stimulate (green arrow) \\nor inhibit (red arrow) the production of pituitary hormones. Why did the aneurysm cause hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea in this patient? It was caused by compression of the pitu\\nitary stalk. The pituitary stalk connects the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland and hormones produced in the hypothalamus are transported to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gla\\nnd via portal veins running along the stalk. Most of these hormones stimulate the production of other hormones in the pituitary gland (such as TRH, GnRH, GHRH and CRH), but the rele\\nase of dopamine inhibits the production of prolactin by the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Therefore when the stalk is compressed by a mass or is transected, the level of prolactin\\n rises while all the other hormone levels decrease. This is known as the 'Stalk Section Effect'.\\nIt is the reason why masses other than adenomas can cause hyperprolactinemia. This is also why an unenhanced MRI scan suffices in a patient with hyperprolactinemia: it is not the si\\nze of the microadenoma, but ruling out other pathology that matters. On the left the T1-weighted image of a thrombosed aneurysm with high signal intensity on the unenhanced scan. It\\n originates in the intracavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery.\\nOn the right the T2-weighted images: the thrombosed aneurysm has a dark rim. This is an example of a partially thrombosed aneurysm in the suprasellar cistern. The patent lumen is bl\\nack on these T1-weighted images. It is surrounded by clot of different ages arranged in layers reaching from the lumen to the wall. It resembles an onion cut in half. On the left an\\n autopsy specimen. You can see that this patient suffered a massive intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The layers of bloodclot are very nicely reflected in the MR images.\\nAneurysm vs Meningioma:\\nOne of the most difficult differential diagnoses on CT is aneurysm versus meningioma. In this patient there is a large mass on the right hand side, possibly originating from the men\\ninges or cavernous sinus. On CT it is impossible to tell whether this mass is an aneurysm or a meningioma. This is an MRI of the same patient. The mass is predominantly black and th\\nere is a large flow artefact running in the phase-encoding direction. These findings correspond to rapid blood flow, and the mass must therefore be an aneurysm. Angiogram of the sam\\ne patient. It demonstrates that the flow in the aneurysm is not laminar, but that it swirls, gradually filling the lumen with contrast.\\nHamartoma:\\nHamartomas are masses of dysplastic tissue found almost exclusively in young children. One of the most common locations is the floor of the third ventricle. This is a pathology spec\\nimen showing a small nodule hanging in the suprasellar cistern. They are benign lesions, but patients do succumb to them because of the bad location. These are CT images of a hamart\\noma suspended from the floor of the third ventricle. It does not enhance after the administration of intravenous contrast. MR images of a similar small nodule suspended from the flo\\nor of the third ventricle. Hamartoma (red arrow) posterior to the enhancing pituitary gland and stalk. The best images to see hamartomas on are enhanced sagittal T1-weighted MR imag\\nes. Here you can see the non-enhancing hamartoma attached to the tuber cinereum between the pituitary stalk and mamillary body. There really is no differential diagnosis.\\nHypothalamic and Chiasm Glioma:\\nOptic nerve glioma in a patient with neurofibromatosis Gliomas can occur in any part of the brain and the optic chiasm is a common location, particularly in patients with neurofibro\\nmatosis type 1. This enhanced CT shows an example of an optic nerve glioma in a patient with neurofibromatosis. There is a suprasellar mass which is indistinguishable from the optic\\n chiasm. Further forward at the level of the orbits the optic nerve is abnormal on both sides. These consecutive coronal MR-images show the mass at the optic chiasm and the swollen \\noptic nerves. On these axial images you can see the optic nerves and chiasm enhance after the administration of intravenous gadolinium. The way a patient is normally positioned, sli\\nces through the nerves themselves are not obtained. These slices can be used to make oblique images along the axis of the nerves. With these images as a result. Note the enhancement\\n of the nerve after intravenous contrast with sparing of the meninges. Approximately 25% of optic nerve gliomas do not enhance, so a lack of enhancement should not prevent you from \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 183}),\n",

Note the normal pituitary gland and stalk.\\nGerminoma:\\nGerminoma (Courtesy of Dr. Susan Blaser) The following case concerns a 9-year-old male with a history of headache, nausea and vomiting. Sagittal T1 images before and after intraveno\\nus contrast show a mass in the midline, on the floor of the third ventricle. The mass enhances after gadolinium. Continue with next images. T2- and T1 weighted sagittal images of th\\ne same patient show a similar mass in the epiphysial area. This is a germinoma - an intracranial germ cell tumor that occurs primarily in children and adolescents. These are typical\\n localisations. These lesions crawl along the floor of the 3rd ventricle.\\nChordoma:\\nChordomas are the most common lesions of the clivus, also a favored location for metastases and chondrosarcomas. This patient has a normal pituitary gland. Posterior to this is a la\\nrge, fungating mass positioned at the level of the clivus. The CT shows some calcifications in this area. The differential diagnosis for this mass would be chordoma or chondrosarcom\\na. Chordomas tend to occur in the midline, whereas chondrosarcomas tend to occur off the midline.\\nMetastases:\\nThe patient on the left is a patient with lung cancer who presented with a sixth cranial nerve palsy. The abnormality is in the clivus, which should have a high signal intensity on \\nthis sagittal T1-weighted image (as in the image on the left). A low signal intensity means the normal fatty marrow has been replaced by some other tissue. In this case by tumor met\\nastasis. Also lymphomas, myelomas or diffuse bone abnormalities can give this appearance. Therefore always take a minute to look at the clivus. So again in order to analyse a sellar\\n or parasellar mass on MRI we use the following anatomic approach:\\nCT-pattern of Bowel wall thickening:\\nRichard Gore and Robin Smithuis\\nProfessor of Radiology, University of Chicago, Evanston, IL, USA and the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2014-05-21 This article is based on a presentation given by Richad Gore and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Richard Gore is editor of the Text\\nbook of Gastrointestinal Radiology, 3rd Edition and High Yield Imaging: Gastrointestinal. We will discuss a pattern approach to patients with bowel wall thickening with special atte\\nntion to the CT-enhancement patterns.\\nIntroduction:\\nBowel wall thickening is a common finding in imaging. CT can be helpful in the differentiation of intestinal disease. Important features to look for are: All these features will be \\ndiscussed in detail in the following paragraphs.\\nLenght of bowel wall involvement:\\nAdenocarcinoma usually presents as a short segment of bowel wall thickening. The borders are shouldering unlike in diverticulitis, where the borders are tapering (figure).\\n* 5-10 cm involvement Diverticulitis, Crohn's disease and ischemia usually present as a somewhat longer segment of involvement.\\n* 10-30 cm involvement See the list in the table. The image shows a submucosal hemorrhage. This is mostly seen in the small bowel and duodenum.\\n* Diffuse involvement When the entire colon is involved think of ulcerative colitis. Involvement of both the colon and the small bowel is seen in infectious bowel disease (IBD), ede\\nma and SLE.\\nOverview of enhancement pattern:\\nThe figure shows an overview of the CT-patterns of mural enhancement in patients with bowel wall thickening. Click to enlarge.\\nType 1 - White Attenuation:\\nThere are many pathophysiologic events that can cause a white attenuation pattern: Normal bowel wall enhancement. The normal bowel will enhance bright especially if the scan is in t\\nhe late arterial phase, i.e. 35-40 seconds post injection. If the bowel wall is not thickened, this is normal enhancement. When there is bright enhancement in thickened bowel, it is\\n sometimes difficult to differentiate between the white enhancement pattern and the water-target-sign pattern. Acute inflammatory bowel disease.\\nAcute IBD:\\nHere a patient with acute inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Notice the bright enhancement of a large segment of the small bowel with a thickened wall. This is the result of hyperemi\\na due to the vasodilatation. Notice the dilated vessels on the ventral side. Shock bowel with hyperenhancement. Slit-like IVC (red arrow).\\nShock Bowel:\\nIn patients with a hypovolemic shock, there is a redistribution of the blood flow. This can result in abnormal bright enhancement of the bowel wall like in this case of a patient wh\\no is in a hemorrhagic shock. Notice that some bowel loops show a white pattern, while others show a water target sign. The slit-like inferior vena cava is due to the hypovolemia (re\\nd arrow). Hyperenhancing adrenal glands in shock. As a result of redistribution of bloodflow to vital organs, these patients can have hyperenhancing adrenal glands, as these organs \\nare needed to produce adrenaline in order to manage the shock.\\nType 2 - Gray Attenuation:\\nIn the gray-pattern, the bowel wall is thick and despite a nice bolus of contrast there is poor enhancement and you can not see the different layers of the bowel wall. This pattern \\nis seen in chronic fibrotic Crohn's disease, ischemia and neoplasms like adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. Gray enhancement pattern in a patient with chronic Crohn's disease.\\nChronic Crohn's disease:\\nHere a patient with chronic Crohn's disease with cicatrization. In these patients the bowel wall is like a rock and these patients will not respond to steroids or other medication.\\nMesenteric Ischemia:\\nBowel ischemia frequently affects the colon and is more frequently seen in the splenic flexure, descending colon and sigmoid. It is mostly due to a low flow state like hypovolemic s\\nhock or congestive heart failure. Especially in elderly with bowel wall thickening you should always put ischemia in your differential diagnostic list. A special cause of ischemia i\\nn the small bowel is a closed loop obstruction, which we will discuss in a moment. Gray enhancement pattern in a patient with SMV thrombosis. Here a patient with bowel ischemia as a\\n result of thrombosis in the SMV (red arrow). Notice the venous congestion in the mesentery (yellow arrow). Gray enhancement pattern in a patient with closed loop obstruction. Here \\nanother patient with ischemia of a large segment of the small bowel due to a closed loop obstruction. An important appearance of a closed loop obstruction is that of a radial array \\nof dilated small bowel loops with the mesenteric vessels converging to a central point. The findings of ischemia in closed loop obstruction are the same as in patients with other ca\\nuses of mesenteric ischemia: Click here for more information about closed loop obstruction. Sometimes it can be helpful to determine the amount of enhancement on thick slab coronal \\nreconstructions. This is nicely demonstrated in this patient, where there is good enhancement of the jejunum (green area), but lack of enhancement in the ileum (red area) as a resul\\nt of ischemia. Here another case of closed loop obstruction. Notice the difference in enhancement between the normal non-distended loops (green arrow) and the distended strangulated\\n loops (red arrow). In the center are the twisted mesenteric vessels (yellow arrow).\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 184}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Tumor:\\nThe gray enhancement pattern with loss of identification of the various layers of the bowel wall can be seen in various tumors like adenocarcinoma, metastases and GIST. Lymphoma and\\n neuroendocrine tumors like carcinoid usually show somewhat more enhancement. Here a patient with an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid.\\nType 3 - Water target sign:\\nThe most common type of enhancement is the target sign with water density. Target sign with submucosal edema. The target sign is caused by the enhancing mucosa and muscularis propri\\na with the edematous submucosa in between (figure). Pseudomembranous Colitis with dilatation of the sigmoid.\\nPseudomembranous Colitis:\\nPseudomembranous colitis (PMC or sometimes called colitis difficile) is a colitis, that is mostly caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile due to bacterial overgrowth of the co\\nlon in patients who are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Here a patient with PMC. There is ascites and hyper enhancement of the bowel wall with submucosal edema and edema in\\n the mesocolon. The dilated bowel in the right lower abdomen is actually the redundant sigmoid. Pseudomembranous Colitis The diagnosis is made by testing for the presence of C. diff\\nicile toxins in the stool or the presence of C. difficile itself. The endoscopic detection of pseudomembranes on the mucosa of the colon or rectum used to be diagnostic of PMC befor\\ne the above tests and CT were available. Risk factors for developing PMC are: Pseudomembranous colitis Patients present with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever caused by the toxins\\n that are produced by the bacteria. The disease can be complicated by a toxic megacolon. Pseudomembranous colitis The CT findings are:\\nPortal hypertension:\\nPortal hypertension is another cause of the water target sign. When a patient has portal hypertension, the increased pressure is transmitted to the right colon. This leads to the ge\\nneration of inflammatory mediators and increased production of nitrous oxide, which induces tissue injury. This produces an isolated right sided colitis. Study the images and then c\\nontinue reading. The findings are: The differential diagnosis is: Right -sided colitis in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The endoscopic images are of different pa\\ntient with right-sided colitis.\\nSpontaneous bacterial peritonitis:\\nPatients with portal hypertension and right-sided colitis are at risk for developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In these patients there is vascular ectasia in the right colo\\nn. A diffuse colitis can be seen with granular, erythematous and mucosal friability, which just looks like ulcerating colitis. The following items make these patients at risk for de\\nveloping spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Typhlitis in a patient with neutropenia.\\nTyphlitis:\\nTyphlitis is another disease that presents with the water target sign. Typhlitis is a necrotizing inflammation of the cecum, which is usually seen in patients with neutropenia due t\\no acute leukemia, AIDS or aplastic anemia. There is transmural edema and ulceration, which can cause perforation. The micro-organisms that are involved are: Pseudomonas, Candida, CM\\nV and E. Coli. These patients are very sick and have fever, watery-bloody diarrhea and neutropenia. Neutropenia is an abnormally low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell\\n that helps fight off infections, particularly those caused by bacteria and fungi. When the neutropenia is severe - fewer than about 500 cells per microliter of blood - bacteria, th\\nat normally present in the mouth and digestive tract can cause infections. CMV-colitis.\\nInfectious Colitis:\\nRight colon: Diffuse colitis Left colon and Rectosigmoid: Rectosigmoid:\\nIschemia:\\nIn young patients ischemia is usually due to trauma or vasculitis. Here are images of a young patient with SLE. There is a gray-pattern of enhancement of the whole left-sided colon.\\nType 4 - Fat target sign:\\nSubmucosal fat was first reported in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Soon it turned out that submucosal fat was frequently seen in obese patients, espe\\ncially in the transverse and descending colon. Now the most common cause of the fat target sign is obesity. Rapid submucosal fat accumulation can be seen in patients that are treate\\nd with chemotherapy. Here a patient with Crohn's disease and a fat-target sign. 17% of patients with Crohn's disease have submucosal fat in the terminal ileum and ascending colon. I\\nt is dependent on the duration of the disease. Submucosal fat is frequently seen in patients with celiac disease. Especially if there is isolated fat in the duodenum or in the proxi\\nmal jejunum, that is very suspicious of celiac disease. These patients also have more pronounced folds in the ileum compared to the jejunum, which is the opposite of the normal find\\ning (figure). The faeces in these patients may contain more fat (blue arrow). How to deal with submucosal fat?\\nType 5 - Gas - Pneumatosis:\\nThe most concerning pattern is gas within the bowel wall. Gas within the bowel wall is called pneumatosis intestinalis. Pneumatosis intestinalis is seen in life-treatening situation\\ns in patients with ischemia and impending bowel perforation, who need immediate therapy. However pneumatosis can also be found as an incidental finding in patients without abdominal\\n complaints. Finally gas adjacent to the bowel wall can mimick pneumatosis. This is called pseudopneumatosis. So the first question is....are we really dealing with pneumatosis inte\\nstinalis and what is the clinical setting of the patient. The clinical course is generally benign when pneumatosis is an incidental finding, such as when it occurs in association wi\\nth obstructive pulmonary disease.\\nPseudopneumatosis:\\nLet's first start with pseudopneumatosis, because we don't want to alarm anybody by mistaking normal intraluminal gas for pneumatosis. Especially in the cecum and ascending colonic \\ngas bubbles can be trapped between fecal debris and the mucosa. In this case we are quite sure that the gas is intraluminal and not within the wall. In this case it is more difficul\\nt. The linear arrangement of the gas bubbles makes it suspective of pneumatosis. However these gas bubbles are trapped between the fecal debris and the bowel wall. In these cases yo\\nu have to carefully study all the images and use different window settings. Give special attention to the non-dependent bowel wall, where there is no feces in contact with the mucos\\na and gas bubbles will not be seen. Pseudopneumatosis in SBO. String of pearls signThis is a patient with a small bowel obstruction (SBO). Study the images. Then continue reading. T\\nhe CT-images show dilatation of the small bowel. In these patients the folds of the small bowel or valvulae conniventes will widen and air bubbles will become trapped in a stepladde\\nr configuration on the ventral side. On a horizontal beam radiograph of the abdomen this is known as the string of pearls sign. Here another case of SBO with a string of pearls sign\\n. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images. Scroll through the images and then continue reading. At first glance this really looks like pneumatosis in a patient with a very dilated as\\ncending colon due to an obstructing tumor. Notice how gas bubbles can be seen in a circular arrangement and are also seen on the non-dependent portion of the bowel wall (blue arrow)\\n. However when we scroll through the images, it becomes clear that these gas bubbles are only seen in between the bowel wall and the bowel content. When we get to the point, where t\\nhere is a air-fluid level, there are no air bubbles on the non-dependent portion of the bowel wall. So this is another case of pseudopneumatosis. However this still is a very sick b\\nowel and decompression is needed. Such an accumulation of gas bubbles between the mucosa and the bowel content is only possible in a bowel, that has lost its normal peristaltic move\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 185}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"ments due to longstanding and severe obstruction.\\nPortal venous gas:\\nNow let's continue with some patients, who do have pneumatosis. Here a patient in whom there is no doubt about the diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis. Identifying gas within the \\nmesenteric or portal veins is diagnostic of pneumatosis. These patients are not only at risk for bowel ischemia and perforation, but also for sepsis. Portal venous gas is an ominous\\n radiologic sign and is associated with a high mortality rate. The increased use of CT has resulted in the recognition of an increasing number of non-life threatenig causes of porta\\nl venous gas of which diverticulitis is the most common. Here a patient with extensive pneumatosis and gas within the portal veins. Bowel ischemia was found at surgery. Pneumobilia:\\n air in the intrahepatic bile ducts and in the common bile duct (arrow). Gas in the portal veins has to be differentiated from gas within the bile ducts, which is called pneumobilia\\n. Sometimes an air-fluid level can be seen in the portal vein. Portal venous gas is located peripherally in the liver as opposed to pneumobilia which is usually more centrally locat\\ned. In this case it is obvious that the air is located within the bile ducts. There is air centrally in the liver and we also see air in the common bile duct (arrow). Obstruction is\\n a common cause of pneumatosis. Here a patient with pneumatosis of the cecum and ascending colon as a result of obstruction due to a sigmoid cancer (arrow). The gas in the bowel wal\\nl indicates an impending perforation. Here another patient with pneumatosis as result of an obstruction.

Laceration of the mucosa due to anastomotic surgery or catheter manupilation may result in entrance of gas into the submucosal layer. In\\n this patient the insertion of a feeding catheter resulted in pneumatosis of the small bowel. Pneumatosis after insertion of a PEG-tube.

Here a very strange case to show how difficult things can be and that findings are not always what they appear to be. This patient was sept\\nic and based on the ultrasound findings the diagnosis of an abscess post-cholecystectomy was made. A CT was performed to prepare for a CT-guided percutaneous drainage of the abscess\\n (red circle). Scroll through the images. Then continue reading. On the first image there is gas in the portal veins. There is a feeding catheter which is placed in the duodenum. Th\\nere is extensive pneumatosis (red arrows). The curved arrow indicates the markers that were placed in preparation of the CT-guided drainage. Based on these findings the patient was \\ntransferred for emergency laparotomy, because bowel ischemia was suspected. At surgery the bowel was distended, but there were no signs of ischemia. The abscess was drained surgical\\nly and the patient did well. Finally it was concluded that the pneumatosis was probably the result of mucosal damage by the feeding catheter. This strange case should not mislead yo\\nu. These CT-findings will always be suspective of bowel ischemia and necessitate emergency surgery in the proper clinical setting as was in this case.\\nIncidental pneumatosis:\\nHere images of a patient without any abdominal symptoms. There is pneumatosis, which was regarded as an incidental finding. Asymptomatic pneumatosis can be seen in patients with ast\\nhma and COPD.\\nPneumatosis in mesenteric ischemia:\\nPneumatosis is sometimes seen in mesenteric ischemia and is a sign of pending perforation and necrosis. In this patient there is an occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (red \\narrow). This has resulted in ischemia of the right colon with pneumatosis. Notice the subtle portal venous gas in the left lobe of the liver (yellow arrow).\\nDegree of mural thickening:\\nThe diseases that cause the largest bowel wall thickening are Crohn's disease and Pseudomembranous colitis (PMC).\\nMesenteric abnormalities:\\nPatency of the mesenteric vesselsThe causes of bowel ischemia are arterial occlusion, venous thrombosis, strangulation and a low flow state.

Notice the gr\\noup of small bowel loops with a thickened wall in the right upper abdomen (yellow arrow). The mesenteric edema (red arrow) indicates increased venous pressure due to strangulation. \\nEngorgement of vessels Increased venous pressure in strangulation also leads to engorgement of veins (yellow arrow).

It is more common than previously thought and frequent\\nly missed on initial imaging. It is a difficult diagnosis because of its nonspecific clinical presentation and subtle imaging findings. In this article we will focus on: Pitfalls. I\\nntroduction\\nIntroduction:\\nCerebral venous thrombosis is located in descending order in the following venous structures: Internal cerebral and thalamostriate veins.\\n* Cavernous sinus. Clinically patients with cerebral venous thrombosis present with variable symptoms ranging from headache to seizure and coma in severe cases. In neonates shock an\\nd dehydration is a common cause of venous thrombosis. In older children it is often local infection, such as mastoiditis, or coagulopathy. In adults, coagulopathies is the cause in \\n70% and infection is the cause in 10% of cases. In women, oral contraceptive use and pregnancy are strong risk factors.\\nWhen to think of venous thrombosis:\\nVenous thrombosis has a nonspecific presentation and therefore it is important to recognize subtle imaging findings and indirect signs that may indicate the presence of thrombosis. \\nAlthough these findings are often present on initial scans, they are frequently detected only in retrospect. Clinically patients with venous thrombosis often present with seizures, \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 186}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='which is not a symptom in patients with an arterial infarction. On a routine non-enhanced MR or CT you should think of the possibility of venous thrombosis when you see:\\nDense clot sign:\\nDirect visualization of a clot in the cerebral veins on a non enhanced CT scan is known as the dense clot sign. It is seen in only one third of cases. Normally veins are slightly de\\nnser than brain tissue and in some cases it is difficult to say whether the vein is normal or too dense (see pitfalls). In these cases a contrast enhanced scan is necessary to solve\\n this problem. Dense clot sign in a thrombosed cortical vein. Dense clot sign (2) Visualization of a thrombosed cortical vein that is seen as a linear or cord-like density, is also \\nknown as the cord sign. Another term that is frequently used, is the dense vessel sign. Dense clot sign (3) On the left images of a patient with a hemorrhagic infarction in the temp\\noral lobe (red arrow). Notice the dense transverse sinus due to thrombosis (blue arrows). Two cases of empty delta sign due to thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.\\nEmpty delta sign:\\nThe empty delta sign is a finding that is seen on a contrast enhanced CT (CECT) and was first described in thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. The sign consists of a triangul\\nar area of enhancement with a relatively low-attenuating center, which is the thrombosed sinus. The likely explanation is enhancement of the rich dural venous collateral circulation\\n surrounding the thrombosed sinus, producing the central region of low attenuation. In early thrombosis the empty delta sign may be absent and you will have to rely on non-visualiza\\ntion of the thrombosed vein on the CECT. The sign may be absent after two months due to recanalization within the thrombus. Empty delta sign (2) On the left a case of thrombosis of \\nthe right transverse sinus and the left transverse and sigmoid sinus (arrows). There is enhancement surrounding the thrombosed hypoattenuating veins. Venous thrombosis with absence \\nof normal flow void on T2-weighted image..\\nAbsence of normal flow void on MR:\\nOn spin-echo images patent cerebral veins usually will demonstrate low signal intensity due to flow void. Flow voids are best seen on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, but can sometimes\\n also be seen on T1-weighted images. A thrombus will manifest as absence of flow void. Although this is not a completely reliable sign, it is often one of the first things, that mak\\ne you think of the possibility of venous thrombosis. The next step has to be a contrast enhanced study. On the left a T2-weighted image with normal flow void in the right sigmoid si\\nnus and jugular vein (blue arrow). On the left there is abnormal high signal as a result of thrombosis (red arrow). Venous thrombosis with absence of normal flow void on T1-weighted\\n image. Absence of normal flow void on MR (2)\\nThe images on the left show abnormal high signal on the T1-weighted images due to thrombosis. The thrombosis extends from the deep cerebral veins and straight sinus to the transvers\\ne and sigmoid sinus on the right. Notice the normal flow void in the left transverse sinus on the right lower image. Absence of normal flow void on MR-images can be very helpful in \\ndetecting venous thrombosis, but there are some pitfalls as we will discuss later. Slow flow can occur in veins and cause T1 hyperintensity.\\nVenous infarction:\\nThe other sign that can help you in making the diagnosis of unsuspected venous thrombosis is venous infarction. Venous thrombosis leads to a high venous pressure which first results\\n in vasogenic edema in the white matter of the affected area. When the proces continues it may lead to infarction and development of cytotoxic edema next to the vasogenic edema. Thi\\ns is unlike in an arterial infarction in which there is only cytotoxic edema and no vasogenic edema. Due to the high venous pressure hemorrhage is seen more frequently in venous inf\\narction compared to arterial infarction. Since we are not that familiar with venous infarctions, we often think of them as infarctions in an atypical location or in a non-arterial d\\nistribution. However venous infarctions do have a typical distribution, as shown on the left. Since many veins are midline structures, venous infarcts are often bilateral. This is s\\neen in thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, straight sinus and the internal cerebral veins. Bilateral infarction in superior sagittal sinus thrombosis Venous infarction (2) - \\nSuperior sagittal sinus thrombosis The most frequently thrombosed venous structure is the superior sagittal sinus. Infarction is seen in 75% of cases. The abnormalities are parasagi\\nttal and frequently bilateral. Hemorrhage is seen in 60% of the cases. On the left bilateral parasagittal edema and subte hemorrhage in a patient with thrombosis of the superior sag\\nittal sinus. On the left reconstructed sagittal CT-images in a patient with bilateral parasagittal hemorrhage due to thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. The red arrow on the \\ncontrast enhanced image indicates the filling defect caused by the thrombus. Venous infarct in Labbe territory Venous infarcts (3) - vein of Labbe Another typical venous infarction \\nis due to thrombosis of the vein of Labbe. On the left images demonstrating hypodensity in the white matter and less pronounced in the gray matter of the left temporal lobe. There i\\ns a broad differential diagnosis including arterial infarction, infection, tumor etc. Notice that there is some linear density within the infarcted area. This is due to hemorrhage. \\nIn the differential diagnosis we also should include a venous infarct in the territory of the vein of Labbe. The subtle density in the area of the left transverse sinus (arrow) is t\\nhe key to the diagnosis. This is a direct sign of thrombosis and the next step is a CECT, which confirmed the diagnosis (not shown). Hemorrhagic venous infarct in Labbe territory On\\n the left images of a patient with hemorrhage in the temporal lobe. When the hemorrhagic component of the infarction is large, it may look like any other intracerebral hematoma with\\n surrounding vasogenic edema. The clue to the diagnosis in this case is seen on the contrast enhanced image, which nicely demonstrates the filling defect in the sigmoid sinus (blue \\narrow). Hemorrhagic venous infarct in Labbe territory On the left a similar case on MR. There is a combination of vasogenic edema (red arrow), cytotoxic edema and hemorrhage (blue a\\nrrow). These findings and the location in the temporal lobe, should make you think of venous infarction due to thrombosis of the vein of Labbe. The next examination should be a cont\\nrast enhanced MR or CT to prove the diagnosis. Venous thrombosis of vein of Galen and straight sinus Venous infarction (4) - Deep cerebral veins On the far left a FLAIR image demons\\ntrating high signal in the left thalamus. When you look closely and you may have to enlarge the image to appreciate this, there is also high signal in the basal ganglia on the right\\n. These bilateral findings should raise the suspicion of deep cerebral venous thrombosis. A sagittal CT reconstruction demonstrates a filling defect in the straight sinus and the ve\\nin of Galen (arrows). On the left a young patient with bilateral abnormalities in the region of the basal ganglia. Based on the imaging findings there is a broad differential includ\\ning small vessel disease, demyelinisation, intoxication and metabolic disorders. Continue with the T1-weighted images in this patient. Bilateral infarctions in the basal ganglia due\\n to deep cerebral venous thrombosis Notice the abnormal high signal in the internal cerebral veins and straight sinus on the T1-weighted images, where there should be a low signal d\\nue to flow void. This was unlike the low signal in other sinuses. The diagnosis is bilateral infarctions in the basal ganglia due to deep cerebral venous thrombosis. Venous infarcti\\non (5) - Edema In some cases of venous thrombosis the imaging findings can resolve completely. On the left a patient with a subcortical area of high signal intensity. The first impr\\nession was that this could be a low grade glioma. On a follow up scan the abnormalities had resolved completely. In retrospect a dense vessel sign was seen in one of the cortical ve\\nins and the diagnosis of venous thrombosis was made. The high signal intensity can be attributed to vasogenic edema due to the high venous pressure that resulted from the thrombosis\\n.\\nImaging in suspected thrombosis:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nCT-venography:\\nCT-venography is a simple and straight forward technique to demonstrate venous thrombosis.

Some advocate to do a scan like a CT-arteriography and \\njust add 5-10 seconds delay. To be on the safe side we advocate 45-50 seconds delay after the start of contrast injection. We use at least 70 cc of contrast. On the left some images\\n of a CT-venography demonstrating thrombosis in many sinuses.

On the non-enhanced images you can appreciate the dense thrombus within the trans\\nverse sinus and the hemorrhage in the infarcted area. On the enhanced images a filling defect can be seen in the transverse sinus. You can scroll through the images. Transverse MIP \\nimage of a Phase-Contrast angiography.The right transverse sinus and jugular vein have no signal due to thrombosis.\\nMR-venography:\\nThe MR-techniques that are used for the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis are: Time-of-flight (TOF), phase-contrast angiography (PCA) and contrast-enhanced MR-venography: As a\\n result of being unsaturated, these spins give more signal that surrounding saturated spins.\\n* Phase-contrast angiography uses the principle that spins in blood that is moving in the same direction as a magnetic field gradient develop a phase shift that is proportional to t\\nhe velocity of the spins. This information can be used to determine the velocity of the spins. This image can be subtracted from the image, that is acquired without the velocity enc\\noding gradients, to obtain an angiogram.\\n* Contrast-enhanced MR-venography uses the T1-shortening of Gadolinium. It is similar to contrast-enhanced CT-venography. When you use MIP-projections, always look at the source ima\\nges. On the left a lateral and oblique MIP image from a normal contrast-enhanced MR venography. Notice the prominent vein of Trolard (red arrow) and vein of Labbe (blue arrow). Ever\\ny MR techniques has its own pitfalls as we will discuss in a moment. Contrast-enhanced MR venography has the disadvantage that you need to give contrast, but has less pitfalls.\\nDSA:\\nAngiography is only performed in severe cases, when an intervention is planned. On the left images of a patient with venous thrombosis, who was unconsious and did not respond to ant\\nicoagulant therapy. There is thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus (red arrow), straight sinus (blue arrow) and transverse and sigmoid sinus (yellow arrow). Continue with the vi\\ndeo of the thrombectomy. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. On the left a video of the thrombectomy.\\nPitfalls in CT:\\nArachnoid Granulations:\\nArachnoid granulations are small protrusions of the arachnoid through the dura mater. They protrude into the venous sinuses and may mimic filling defects caused by thrombus. Usually\\n these granulations are easily to differentiate from thrombosis. Normal transverse sinus (left) and thrombosed transverse sinus (right).\\nMimick of dense clot sign:\\nNormally veins are slightly denser than brain tissue and in some cases it is difficult to say whether it is normal or too dense. In these cases a contrast enhanced scan is necessary\\n to solve this problem. On the left an image of a thrombosed transverse sinus and next to it a normal transverse sinus. Mimick of dense clot sign in an infant In infants the brain i\\ns usually less dense than in older children and adults. This results in a relative high density of the blood in the sagittal sinus compared to the brain, which simulates a dense clo\\nt sign. Hematoma mimicking a dense clot sign Hematoma simulating dense clot sign. Usually there is no problem in differentiating a hematoma from a thrombosed sinus. Here a patient w\\nith a peripheral intracerebral hematoma. Because it is located in the area of the transverse sinus it simulates a thrombosed transverse sinus.\\nPseudo empty delta sign:\\nHere a patient with a subdural hematoma on the left side, that has spread to the region of the superior sagittal sinus (arrows). At first impression this looks like an empty delta s\\nign. By scrolling through the data set, it was obvious that it was an extention of the hematoma. A hyperdense empyema can sometimes also mimick an empty delta sign.\\nWrong bolus timing:\\nOn the left three images of a patient with venous thrombosis in the superior sagittal sinus. On the far left we see a dense vessel sign on the unenhanced CT. In the middle an image \\nmade 25 seconds after the start of the contrast injection. There is arterial enhancement and it looks as if the superior sagittal sinus enhances, but in fact what we see is the shin\\ne through of the dense thrombus. Only on the image on the right, which was made 45 seconds after contrast injection there is an empty delta sign, which proves the presence of a thro\\nmbus in the sinus.\\nPitfalls in MRI:\\nHypoplastic transverse sinus:\\nHypoplasia and aplasia of the right or left transverse sinus is a common finding. It can easily be mistaken for sinus thrombosis, because on the MRA one of the transverse sinuses is\\n missing. When you suspect, that there is a hypoplastic transverse sinus, then you should look at the size of the jugular foramen. On the left images of a patient with hypoplasia of\\n the left transverse sinus. Notice the size difference of the jugular foramen. On the left a transverse MIP of phase-contrast images. To differentiate whether there is a hypoplastic\\n transverse sinus or thrombosed sinus, you need to look at the source images. On the source image on the right you can see that there is no hypoplasia (blue arrow). In this case the\\nre thrombosis of the left transverse sinus. On the left another case that demonstrates that you cannot fully rely on phase contrast imaging. The signal in the vein depends on the ve\\nlocity of the flowing blood and the velocity encoding by the technician. On the far left a patient with non visualization of the left transverse sinus. This could be hypoplasia, ven\\nous thrombosis or slow flow. On the contrast enhanced T1-weighted image it is obvious that the sinus fills with contrast and is patent. Thrombus in right transverse sinus is dark on\\n T2 due to intracellular deoxyhemoglobin (Courtesy dr. Howard Rowley)\\nLow signal intensity in thrombus:\\nNormally when there is low signal in a vein, it is attributed to flow void and a sign of patency of the vein. However at some stage of the thrombus there is intracellular deoxyhemog\\nlobin, which is dark on T2 and mimics flow void. On the left there is a thrombosed right transverse sinus with a delta sign on the contrast enhanced image. The sinus has a low signa\\nl intensity on the T2-weighted image as a result of the intracellular deoxyhemoglobin. On the contrast enhanced T1-weighted image it is obvious that the sinus is filled with thrombu\\ns.\\nFlow void on contrast-enhanced MR:\\nOn the contrast enhanced T1 images on the left there is an area of low signal intensity within the enhancing transverse sinus. This could easily been mistaken for a central thrombus\\n within the sinus. This however is the result of flow void. Continue with the phase contrast images. On the phase contrast images it is obvious that the transverse sinus is patent. \\nWe can conclude that MRI has many false positives and negatives in the diagnosis of venous thrombosis.\\nContrast enhanced MR-venography is the most reliable MR technique.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 188}),\n",

Pitfalls in TOF imaging are:\\nChronic dural sinus thrombosis and related syndromes:\\nDAVF:\\nChronic dural sinus thrombosis can lead to dural arteriovenous fistula formation and to increased CSF pressure. A DAVF or dural arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection betwe\\nen dural arteries, which are branches of the external carotid with the venous sinuses.\\nSinus thrombosis is seen in many patients with a dural arteriovenous fistula, but the pathogenesis is still unclear (10). There are two possible mechanisms: (a) thrombophlebitis of \\nthe dural sinus may induce a dural fistula and (b) in the course of a dural fistula flow reversal may lead to thrombosis. Current classifications of DAVF focus mainly on the presenc\\ne of leptomeningeal reflux related to cerebral venous hypertension leading to cerebral venous infarction or hemorrhage. On the left DSA images of a patient with a DAVF.\\nNotice the direct communication between the branches of the external carotid artery and the transverse sinus (blue arrow).

In january 2009 there are signs of intracranial hypertension like CSF surrounding the optic nerve and CSF within t\\nhe stalk of the hypophysis.\\nThrombosis and increased CSF pressure:\\nIn some patients dural sinus thrombosis may, even after recanalisation, lead to persisting disturbances in venous circulation. This may lead to raised intracranial CSF pressure as a\\nssessed by lumbar puncture. Clinically, these patients complain of headaches and they may have vision disturbances due to papil edema. On MRI, one may see increased CSF around the o\\nptic nerve and an empty sella. Apparently in some patients a residual stenosis persists. On the left a T2-weighted image demonstrating papil edema and an empty sella. Continue with \\nthe sagittal T1-weighted image. Here the sagittal T1-weighted image demonstrating the empty sella (arrow). It is called an empty sella because the sella is mainly filled with CSF as\\n the hypofysis is compressed downwards due to the increased intracranial pressure.\\nVenous territories:\\nOn the left an illustration of the territories of the venous drainage.

Full thickness tears are typically injurie\\ns to the free tendons or the insertion of the tendons on the ischial tuberosity. \\nIn these injuries the question is whether a surgical repair is needed. Partial thickness injuries are most often injuries to the musculotendinous or musculofascial junction.\\nThese injuries usually do not require surgery. The goal of imaging is to determine the prognosis and to guide the return to normal function.\\nIntroduction:\\nAnatomy:\\nThe hamstrings are the muscles in the posterior compartment of the thigh and consist of the biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus.\\nThey are innervated by the sciatic nerve and contraction results in extention of the hip and flexion of the knee.\\nThe conjoint tendon is formed by the long head of the biceps femoris laterally and the semitendinosus tendon medially. Biceps femoris\\nThe biceps femoris muscle has two heads. \\nThe long head originates from the ischial tuberosity, while the short head originates from the linea aspera on the posterior surface of the femur. \\nThe common tendon of the two heads can be felt laterally at the posterior knee and inserts onto the head of the fibula. Semitendinosus\\nThe semitendinosus is a largely tendinous muscle, which is located medially to the biceps femoris, and covers the majority of the semimembranosus muscle. Semimembranosus\\nThe semimembranosus muscle is flattened and broad. It is located underneath the semitendinosus. Here the anatomy is shown on a coronal MR image. The insertion of the semitendinosus \\n(2) on the hamstring origin is partly muscular. The free tendon is attached to the ischial tuberosity, it has no muscle fibers attached to it. The interface between tendon and muscl\\ne fibers is the musculotendinous junction. The part of the tendon with muscle fibers attached to it is the intramuscular tendon. The muscle itself is surrounded by the fascia. The h\\namstrings insert on the upper region of the ischial tuberosity. On this posterior view you will notice that the semimembranous tendon inserts on the lateral side, while the muscle i\\ns located medially.\\nThe Conjoint tendon of the biceps femoris and the semitendinosus inserts on the medial facet.

When the tendons are avulsed from the tuber but the connection with\\n this ligament is intact, the STL can act as a ‘lifeline’ to prevent tendon retraction. Note that the semitendinosus also has muscle fibers directly attaching to the ischial tuberos\\nity. The tendon of the semimembranosus runs underneath the conjoint tendon and attaches more lateral on the ischial tuberosity. Here the semitendinosus and biceps femoris are held a\\nside to get a better view on the semimembranosus muscle and tendon.\\nNotice that the semimembranosus tendon attaches lateral to the conjoint tendon. The sciatic nerve lies in close proximity to the proximal hamstring attachment, about one centimeter \\nlateral. On this axial MR-image note the aponeurotic connection between the sacrotuberous ligament and the superficial part of the conjoint tendon. In some cases, the tendons may be\\n avulsed from the ischial tuberosity while this connection remains intact. In these cases no retraction will be present and surgery is usually not necessary.\\nBritish athletics muscle injury classification:\\nBAMIC is the most commonly used classification system for hamstring injuries. Grade 0-3 are partial thickness injuries.\\nAn additional suffix 'a', 'b' or 'c' indicates if the partial thickness injury is: Grade 4 is a full thickness tear with or without retraction.\\nPartial thickness injuries (grade 0-3):\\nPartial thickness injuries (grade 0-3) usually involve the musculotendinous junction with or without waviness of the intramuscular tendon.\\nSometimes the area where the muscle attaches to the fascia is involved. This is called a myofascial or epimysial injury.\\nFull thickness injuries (grade 4):\\nIn young patients this can be an apophysiolysis of the ischial tuberosity. In adults it is either a tendon avulsion or a free tendon tear. Modifiers in the decision-making process a\\nnd part of pre-operative planning are:\\nMRI report:\\nThere is great interest in and debate how MRI findings can help guide prognosis, progression through the rehabilitation programme, and return-to-play decision-making. This accounts \\nmost for partial thickness injuries. Therefore, all points from MRI report on the left are noted (with special interest for length of edema and distortion), although it remains uncl\\near which finding is best in predicting prognosis.\\nPartial thickness injury:\\nThe vast majority of partial hamstring injuries are located at the musculotendinous junction (MTJ), where forces are transmitted from muscle fibers to the fibers of the intramuscula\\nr tendon. These injuries are typically seen when athletes reach for the posterior thigh in a sprint. These injuries occur with or without concomitant injury of the intramuscular ten\\ndon. Partial-thickness hamstring injuries are treated non-operatively with a phased rehabilitation program.\\nLength of edema:\\nPresence of edema can be used to localize the injury.\\nEdema is typically present as feather-shaped high signal intensity as it surrounds the intramuscular tendon and fascicles. Total length of the edema is noted (white dotted line). No\\nw take a closer look at the tendon (yellow dotted line) and continue reading.\\nLength of tendon distortion:\\nWhen the tendon looks normal, straining is probable low grade. \\nTendon thickening, tendon waviness, high signal of the tendon can all be signs of higher grade straining. Case 1: normal tendon. \\nCase 2 slightly thickening and wavy aspect of a short length of the tendon. \\nCase 3: obvious thickening and waviness All these signs have to be described in your report. \\nTotal length of the distorted tendon is noted.\\nCoronal versus axial:\\nBased on coronal images alone, it is sometimes challenging to exactly classify the amount of distortion. Use the axial images to get a closer look. On these axial images, high signa\\nl and thickening of the left biceps femoris tendon (yellow dotted circle) is seen when compared to the non-injured side (white dotted circle). DOMS\\nIn this patient, subtle muscle edema in the semitendinosus was seen, diagnosed as DOMS - delayed onset muscle soreness (arrow). Both length of edema and distorted tendon are measure\\nd and noted in the report.

Length of edema and tendon distortion are of high grade. This was classified as a BAMIC 3b/c injury.\\nFull thickness injury:\\nFree tendon tear:\\nIn full thickness injuries, the free tendon is torn and  discontinuous with the ischial tuberosity. Since tension is lost, the tendon and muscle will retract from the tuberosity and\\n a gap is seen. The extent of tendon retraction or is considered an important factor for treatment decision-making.\\nSome experts advocate surgical repair when retraction is more than 2 centimeters.\\nDirect measurement of retraction:\\nThe most reliable method to quantify retraction is the ‘direct measurement’ on a coronal fluid-sensitive sequence. First, the point representing the center (white triangle) of the p\\nroximal hamstring complex origin on the upper region (dotted line) of the ischial tuberosity (IT) is determined. \\nFrom this point, the direct (ie, shortest) distance (white arrow) to the most proximal part of the hypointense tendon stump (black triangles) is measured (in cm). Note that determin\\ning the anatomic landmarks is done on different images within one MRI sequence.\\nDropped icecream sign:\\nIt is best to determine which tendon is torn on axial images.

The edema surrounds the ischiadic nerve (yellow arrow), which can lead to neuropathy. \\nHowever there is a poor correlation between the MRI findings and the symptoms of the patient. In this case, the partial injury is less pronounced. Still, the ischiadic nerve is enla\\nrged and flattened due to the injury edema. All features of possible nerve involvement (nerve enlargement, flattening, nerve edema, surrounding edema or surrounding fibrosis) are no\\nted.\\nFollow up:\\nOld injury:\\nAfter the injury, it is possible that the tendon looks normal after healing. However, in most partial injuries, fibrous scarring is seen at the site of the previous injury (yellow d\\notted circle). Quite often, when MRI is made for an acute injury, other sites of fibrous scarring of older injuries are seen.\\nReinsertion:\\nAfter a full thickness avulsion, tendons can be reinserted operatively.

The relationship between hiatus hernia, reflux and reflux esophagitis is controversial and poorly understood. Most pa\\ntients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have hernias. Many patients with hiatus hernias do not have reflux. Many patients with reflux do not have hiatus hernias. Presence\\n of reflux correlates poorly with GERD.\\nA sliding hiatus hernia is of doubtful significance when an isolated finding in the absence of clinical or imaging findings of esophagitis. Diagnosis of GERD is based on imaging or \\nendoscopic findings of esophagitis, not presence of a hiatus hernia. Sliding hernia On the left initially, GE junction is below the esophageal hiatus. Later, stomach protrudes throu\\ngh hiatus. Neither the hernia or stricture (arrow) due to reflux esophagitis were visible early in the examination. Paraesophageal hernia Large hernias can cause symptoms, and with \\nprogressive hiatal widening, increasing protrusion and rotation of the stomach can lead to gastric volvulus that can be complicated by hemorrhage, obstruction, strangulation, perfor\\nation.

The literature indicates that over 20 % of patients unde\\nrgoing cholecystectomy, have unchanged symptoms after the operation, suggesting that the diagnosis of symptomatic gallstone disease was not correctly made. On the other hand, the di\\nagnosis of acute gallstone disease can be missed because the doctor  mistakes the symptoms for another condition e.g. acute cardiovascular disease. \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 193}),\n",

Symptoms are often typical with episodes of intense pain in the upp\\ner abdomen, radiating to the back and to the right side, but also sometimes to the left side.  \\nPatients are often nauseous and may collapse from the pain. \\nNot rarely, the pain awakes patients from their sleep.\\nDuring a biliary colic, patients preferably do not sit still, and have an urge to move and walk around. \\nThey continuously  “try to find a position to tolerate the pain”. When the stone is not obstructing the gallbladder neck at the time of the examination, it will be difficult to make\\n the diagnosis of symptomatic gallstone disease and you will be able to compress the gallbladder fundus (fig). However in patients with  a history of typical, uncomplicated colicky \\nattacks without signs of cholestasis, in whom stones in the gallbladder are demonstrated on US,  the indication for cholecystectomy is evident. On the other hand, in patients with a\\ntypical symptoms, it is not always clear whether the US-demonstrated gallstones are actually the cause of the patient’s symptoms, resulting in quite a few patients who have unchange\\nd symptoms  after cholecystectomy. However in patients with  a history of typical, uncomplicated colicky attacks without signs of cholestasis, in whom stones in the gallbladder are \\ndemonstrated on US,  the indication for cholecystectomy is evident (fig).

US scanning during an episode of pain can be very helpful. \\nPatients who undergo US during an acute biliary colic, at that particular moment –invariably-  either show a hydropic gallbladder or dilated biliary ducts.These US signs however may\\n rapidly disappear when the obstruction is relieved, either spontaneously or due to spasmolytic medication, which is usaully given at the ER.\\nAcute Hydrops:\\nHydrops sign:\\nPersistent obstruction of the gallbladder results in a hydropic gallbladder due to ongoing mucus production by the gallbladder mucosa. The hydrops sign is tested by applying graded \\ncompression over the gallbladder. The hydrops-sign is positive if the gallbladder during compression “bulges” into the abdominal wall and keeps its rounded contour (fig). This is be\\nst seen in expiration, when the abdominal wall muscles relax. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Here we can see how the hydropic gallbladder will keeps its rounded shape during compression.\\nIf the obstruction carries on long enough, the high intraluminal  pressure may lead to temporary ischemia of the gallbladder wall. The US signs of acute hydrops due to an impacted s\\ntone obstructing the gallbladder, are given in the table. The non-compressibility of the gallbladder and direkt demonstration of the impacted stone in the galbladder neck or cystic \\nduct are the most valuable signs (****). Here images of a patient with acute hydrops of the gallbladder, visualized in its longitudinal and its axial plane.\\nThe obstructing stone is impacted (arrow). \\nNote that during compression the hydropic gallbladder bulges into the abdominal wall (arrowheads), indicating high intraluminal pressure. It is however not always possible to visual\\nize the hydrops-sign reliably, especially when the gallbladder lies high under the right costal arch. \\nAlso the impacted stone may be impossible to visualize in large persons, due to its deep location, far from the transducer. Not infrequently, also on CT scan hydrops of the gallblad\\nder may be identified (fig), but often complementary US is very useful. Here images of a patient with clinically suspected stomach perforation. CT shows some stones in a rounded gal\\nlbladder. Complementary US unequivocally demonstrates hydrops (arrowheads). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Even in the case, when there is intervening liver tissue between the abdominal wall and the gallbladder, an indirect “hydrops-sign” can be demonstrated. The left imag\\ne shows a gallbladder that keeps  its rounded shape, without and during compression, and bulges into the soft interposing liver tissue and abdominal wall. Likewise, the absence of h\\nydrops can be demonstrated,  even when there is intervening liver tissue, which is soft during compression (image on the right).\\nHow to demonstrate an impacted stone:\\nIn this patient examination in the decubitus position could not identify an obstructing stone  due to the presence of multiple stones. If  US in the standing position shows that all\\n loose stones have migrated to the fundus, the patient is asked to lie down again, immediately turning on its left side. \\nIn this way the stones, will remain in the fundus, allowing better visualization of the gallbladder neck and cystic duct (fig). \\nAll stones have moved to the fundus except the impacted stone (arrow). There is gallbladder wall thickening indicating developing cholecystitis (CRP was 110). Note that in case of i\\nnspissated, viscous bile, stones may change position very slowly, sometimes taking several minutes to go to the lowest point. \\nFor this reason, we ask patients with suspected gallstones, always to sit or stand up while waiting for their US examination. Here two examples of impacted stone visualized during b\\niliary colic in different patients. \\nIn the supine position a stone (arrow) is demonstrated in the gallbladder neck. \\nAfter standing up, bending over and walking, the stone (arrow) does not fall down, and therefore must be impacted. Stones in the cystic duct are sometimes not demonstrable in the US\\n plane of the longitudinal axis of the gallbladder. Here images of a patieny with acute hydrops due to an impacted stone. The impacted stone could not be visualized in the longitudi\\nnal axis of the gallbladder, due to its medial position in the cystic duct (arrow).\\nLarge diameter:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 194}),\n",

Secondary wall thickening of the gallbladder may add to the confusion.\\nUS performed after the biliary colic:\\nSilent witnesses:\\nWhat may cause considerable diagnostic confusion, is the fact that -in daily practice- most US examinations in patients with suspected symptomatic gallstones, are performed after th\\ne symptoms have subsided, with intervals varying from hours to weeks. \\nPatients also may have received spasmolytic therapy, which may cause the muscle spasm to relax and bile to pass, changing the US image which can appear atypical and even confusing. \\nThere are silent witnesses that indicate that the patient had an obstructing stone with hydrops of the gallbladder (table). Follow up in 100 patients presenting with acute hydrops a\\nt the ER treated with spasmolytics and not immediately operated. In 15 acute cholecystitis developed. In 25 the stone remained in place, but bile can pass and hydrops disappears. In\\n 60 patients the stone becomes dislodged and the galbladder returns to normal sometimes with a period of reperfusion edema. The natural course of a biliary colic due to an obstructi\\nng stone in the gallbladder neck has various pathways. During the colic the stone is impacted in the gallbladder neck with acute hydrops. \\nPersistent production of mucinous fluid causes high intraluminal pressure, leading to ischemia of the wall. US performed 5 hours after the pain episode. There is both reperfusion ed\\nema and hyperemia of the gallbladder wall. The obstructing stone (arrow) is still visible in the neck, but there was no hydrops\\nReperfusion edema:\\nIt is important to realize that patients only experience pain during the hydrops phase. \\nLaboratory data only show leucocytosis and the CRP remains normal. Soon, the intraluminal pressure will be so high that relative ischemia of the stretched thin gallbladder wall may \\noccur.\\nIf the stone is disimpacted or in another way again allows passage of  bile to the cystic duct, which may happen spontaneously or due to spasmolytic therapy, edema of the gallbladde\\nr wall may develop very rapidly (fig). This edema disappears again within 12-48 hours and is reperfusion-edema, secondary to the episode of ischemia.\\nSometimes also the secondary hyperemia can be found by Doppler US (fig). After the hydrops has disappeared, the colic is over but the patient often experiences a “sore feeling” for \\na while.

When the hydrops has disappeared, patients do not have colicky pain any more. \\nHowever patients often have a vague “sore” feeling in the upper abdomen as if someone has “stumped them in the belly”. It is obvious that it is essential to integrate the patient’s \\nhistory, the laboratory data and the US findings in the final report of the US examination. At day 0 there is acute hydrops due to an impacted stone.\\nOne day later, the patient is symptom free.\\nThe stone is still in place, but apparently allows passage of bile to the cystic duct, since hydrops has  disappeared. Reperfusion edema and sludge are the silent witnesses of the p\\nrevious attack .\\nCRP remained normal.

Of course, not all patients are so lucky that their biliary colic spontaneously subsides.  \\nOf all patients presenting with a biliary colic, in a minority (10-15 %) progression to an acute cholecystitis is seen.\\nAcute Cholecystitis:\\nIf the stone keeps obstructing the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, bacterial infection of the stagnating bile and mucus may turn an acute hydrops into an acute cholecystitis.

Diagnosis: acute hepatitis A.\\nDifferentiation Hydrops - Acute Cholecystitis:\\nMore important than the additional US signs in the differentiation of hydrops versus cholecystitis, are the clinical signs and laboratory findings: fever and elevated infection para\\nmeters. It must be stressed that especially in the elderly the development from acute hydrops into acute cholecystitis is insidious and often subclinical. The pain is often much les\\ns that the original colicky attack and fever is often absent. \\nThis underlines the important role of repeated CRP. \\nElevation of the CRP –in general- precedes the clinical symptoms. If the patient presents late, the gallbladder may show impressive morphological changes. \\nSomewhat confusing may be the fact that in advanced cholecystitis, there can be a less prominent US-hydrops sign, because the diseased wall is not capable of producing mucus anymore\\n and the intraluminal pressure has decreased. The images show a longstanding acute cholecystitis. Note the large area of inflamed and indurated fat (asterisks) and the relatively sm\\nall, somewhat compressible gallbladder. \\nThis reflects a lumen filled with pus where the diseased mucosa is not capable of producing mucus under pressure anymore.

Subsequent surgery confirmed early acute cholecystitis due to a small stone in the\\n cystic duct.\\nSpecial forms of cholecystitis:\\nEmphysematous cholecystitis. US shows air in the gallbladder fundus (arrowheads). CT confirms both intraluminal and intramural air.\\nEmphysematous cholecystitis:\\nThis special form of cholecystitis is usually –but not always- found in older diabetics and has characteristic US and CT features (fig). Because the air indicates wall necrosis, acu\\nte cholecystectomy is usually advised, but successful percutaneous drainage is a good alternative, because surgery is often very risky in these diabetic and often otherwise severely\\n compromised patients. These images are of a non-diabetic patient with severe pain RUQ, CRP 190 and WBC of 19.  \\nUS noted weird aspect of the gallbladder with hyperechoic sludge and bright reflections in the wall.\\nCT showed emphysematous cholecystitis with also free air in the peritoneal cavity.

US is usually aspecific but may show a large mass of sludge-like material and an irregular wall. \\nCT shows hyperdense, non-attenuating masses within the gallbladder lumen (fig).

Another free perforated cholecystitis.\\nThe decompressed gallbladder has a relatively small lumen and  shows an irregular and edematous wall. There is free intra-peritoneal fluid around the uterus, which at US guided punc\\nture is identified as bile. Ill patient with pain RUQ since 4 days, CRP 450 and leuko 14. CT shows local perforation at the fundus with a not well-defined fluid-collection under the\\n left liver lobe. Immediate open cholecystectomy revealed perforated cholecystitis and severe purulent contamination of the peritoneal cavity. If not timely operated, free perforati\\non may eventually lead to distant abscess formation, often with a different location and aspect than the pericholecystic abscesses from complicated cholecystitis (fig). There is a p\\nericholecystic abscess as well as a distant, perihepatic abscess in perforated cholecystitis. Antibiotics were given and only the gallbladder was drained.

Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder was done.\\nThe abscess drained itself into the gallbladder lumen.\\nCholecystitis mimicking malignancy:\\nAcute cholecystitis sometimes is not recognized clinically, especially in the elderly, and may then be treated with antibiotics more than once. \\nThis may cause mitigation and alteration of the normal inflammatory process leading to unusual US and CT findings.  \\nIn such cases not infrequently the diagnosis of gallbladder malignancy is suggested which may lead to ill-advised major surgery. \\nKeep in mind that gallbladder carcinoma in the Western world is very rare, is usually inoperable at presentation and has a poor prognosis anyway.  \\nThe combination of clinical history, US and CT image, and the follow-up in time, can prevent unnecessary major surgery.\\nAcalculous cholecystitis:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 196}),\n",

Marilyn Siegel is \\nspecialized in pediatric and chest radiology. The second edition of her book entitled Pediatric Body CT will be out next week. In this review we will discuss the most common vascula\\nr anomalies of the aorta, pulmonary vessels and systemic veins in the chest. Most of these anomalies are found in children, but sometimes they are discovered later in adulthood. Man\\ny of these anomalies are asymptomatic or 'leave alone' lesions, but some of these anomalies are symptomatic and need to be treated. As a radiologist we have to be familiar with thes\\ne anomalies. A simple mouse click on an item on the left will bring you directly to this subject.\\nOverview of Arch Anomalies:\\nNot a true ring. Usually asymptomatic. Sometimes dysphagia lusoria when dilated suvclavian artery compresses esophagus posteriorly.\\n2. Innominate artery compression syndrome In children the brachiocephalic (innominate) artery is located more to the left and may compresses the trachea anteriorly.\\n3.

Mirror image aortic arch (yellow arrow) and a VSD (red arrow) This anomaly\\n is asymptomatic, because there is no obstructing ring. Almost all of these patients however come to our attention because they have associated congenital heart disease in 98% of ca\\nses. This patient had a mirror image aortic arch and a VSD. Mirror image aortic arch in patient operated for tetralogy of Fallot. On the left an adult who was operated in his childh\\nood for a Tetralogy of Fallot (pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, VSD, overriding aorta). At surgery the VSD was patched and the pulmonary outflow tract was enlarged\\n. Notice that there is also a right arch. In the United States there are now more than one million adults who have survived their congenital heart disease. In the ER you will see th\\nese patients because they age and get chest pain like many adults do and so you will see these anomalies more frequently. View from anterior\\nRight Arch with Aberrant left subclavian:\\nThe Right Aortic Arch with an aberrant left subclavian is an obstructing arch anomaly. The first branch of the aorta is the left common carotid, followed by the right subclavian art\\nery and the left common carotid. This also is a true ring. The ligamentum ductus arteriosus between the arch at the level of the left subclavian artery and the left pumonary artery \\ncompletes the ring. If this ligament is very short, there will be a lot of compression.

There is a right arch and \\nthe left subclavian artery is the last branch of the aortic arch, indicating that this is an aberrant left subclavian. Medially to the left subclavian artery we see the left common \\ncarotid, that originates from the right side and has an oblique course to the left. The yellow arrow indicates the azygos vein.

The type we usually see is the post-ductal type, which is distal to the left subclavian artery. The uncommon pre-duct\\nal type is seen in neonates. They present with severe heart failure, mostly within the first week of life, usually on the first day. The occlusion is in front of the left subclavian\\n. First study the axial image followed by the sagittal reconstruction, then continue. The findings are: Intercostal collaterals in aortic coarctation The intercostal collaterals typ\\nically occur between the 3rd and the 8th rib. Pre-ductal type of coarctation On the left two neonates with the pre-ductal type of coarctation. The stenosis is in front of the left s\\nubclavia and there is arch hypoplasia. Collaterals do not occur, probably because they don't have time to develop.

On the chest film the differential is atelectasis, pneumoni\\na or maybe a tumor. The CT shows, that he right lung is not developed and the space around the atresic pulmonary artery is filled with fibrofatty tissue with collaterals. So this is\\n pulmonary agenesis. If many collaterals develop there will also be some development of the lung.

The sagittal reconstruction shows an anomalous vessel on the poste\\nrior side of the trachea. There is a little mass effect on the trachea. Pulmonary Sling In pulmonary sling the left PA originates from the right PA and courses between the esophagus\\n and the trachea, where it compresses the right main bronchus. Pulmonary sling is seen more frequent in children as it is more symptomatic than in adults, because the chest is small\\ner, but you can also encounter it in adults.

Schoef) On the left images of a child with wheezing and dyspnea.\\n The left PA comes off the right PA and runs between the esophagus (with nasogastric tube) and the trachea.

Patent Ductus Arteriosus\\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus:\\nOn the left an adolescent with a murmur. On axial image and reconstruction the patent ductus arteriosus is seen. The ductus arteriosus is the communication between the pulmonary art\\nery and the proximal descending aorta. It shunts blood in utero from the right ventricle to the aorta to bypass the non-functioning lungs. On the first day of life there is a functi\\nonal closure and an anatomic closure with fibrosis in the first two weeks. If it does not close these patients come to attention either with a murmur or later with pulmonary hyperte\\nnsion. On the left a young adult with a murmur.

Catheters or pacemaker leads may course along left side of mediastinum. On the left a patient with a le\\nft superior intercostal vein. Notice the 'aortic nipple sign'. Left Superior Intercostal Vein On the left another example of a left superior intercostal vein. It courses along the l\\nateral margin of the aortic arch from the the accessory hemiazygos vein to the left brachiocephalic vein. Summary of left paramediastinal structures\\nAzygos Continuation of IVC:\\nTechnique and Protocol:\\nIdeally a 64 slice scanner is used, but even a 4-slice scanner will suffice for studying vascular anomalies. The technique for these anomalies in the chest is the same as we use for\\n pulmonary embolus detection. Thin collimation is used in combination with a fast table speed in order to get the highest resolution with the lowest radiation exposure. Usually a pi\\ntch of 1.5 is used. In children we preferably do not use thin collimation, because of the higher radiation exposure, but these anomalies can be very small (voorbeeld dia 18), so thi\\nn collimation is necessary. mAs and kVp In a child with a weight of less than 10Kg 40mAs will work in the chest. In children with a weight more than 45 Kg adult protocols are used w\\nith 100 mAs or more. In small children under 50 kg you can decrease the kVp to 80 and that works very well in the chest. Remember in the chest there is inherent contrast from the lu\\nngs and by dropping the kVp you enhance this contrast. On the left a 3-year old. Non-breath hold images with 50mAs and 80 kVp on a 16 row detector.\\nAlthough the axial images are a little bit grainy, the reconstructions are just fine. Do these patients need sedation?\\nWell most of the time they don't. If you can get the patient on the table and they are relatively still, even if they are breathing, you will get good studies. If you can't get the \\npatient on the table, because they prefer the floor, you've got to sedate. In about 20-25% of pediatric studies we use sedation. If the catheter is not in the antecubital vein, hand\\n injection is preferred. Scan Initiation Time Bolus tracking is used and the trigger is set at 120 HU. This may not always work, because in small children the amount of contast may \\nbe too small to trigger or due to breathing the cursor may fall to the lungs. If bolus tracking does not trigger, start the scan at 15 seconds. Positioning the ROI Coronal MPR (left\\n), external volume rendering (middle) and internal volume rendering. Post-processing Multiplanar reconstructions (MPR), volume rendered techniques (VRT) and maximum intensity (MIP) \\nare very helpful. There is no role for shaded surface or mini-IP's. On the left an external and internal rendering which provides in contrast to MPR real 3D information. In volume r\\nendering the posterior view is preferred to get a good look at the arch and descending aorta. Thick slab maximal intensity projection to study the pulmonary vasculature. If you want\\n to study peripheral vessels you will need thick slab maximal intensity projections. For instance if you study arteriovenous malformations or discrepancy in lung flow. Thick slab co\\nronal maximal intensity projection image in patient with scimitar syndrome. Notice that on the coronal MIP you can nicely see the difference in vascularization of the lungs with hyp\\novascularity on the right in a patient with scimitar syndrome. High grade coarctation of aorta not seen on axial images but clearly visualized on sagittal MPR. 3D reconstructions ar\\ne helpful when there are short focal lesions like coarctation or when vessels course obliquely (figure). Adding 3D reconstructions to axial images will increase the sensitivity from\\n 90% to 100% (Lee, Siegel AJR 182:777-784 ) On the left a 17-day old boy with minimal cyanosis, mild heart failure and upper extremity hypertension. On axial images you will have tr\\nouble diagnosis coarctation, because it is focal and in the same plane as the axial image.

              " Document(page_content='Publicationdate 2021-08-01 This is the second version of the role of CT in staging pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth largest cause of cancer death in the United Sta\\ntes and Europe with over 100,000 deaths per year in Europe alone.\\nThe overall 5-year survival ranges from 2–7 % and has hardly improved over the last two decades.\\nApproximately 15 % of all patients have presumed resectable disease at diagnosis and of those, only a subgroup has a resectable tumor at surgical exploration. In this article we wil\\nl focus on the criteria for resectability versus irresectability and we will provide a checklist that will help you to make a structured report for staging pancreatic cancer and det\\nermining resectability. At the end of the article there will be videos by Frank Wessels on how to stage pancreatic cancer.\\nIntroduction:\\nComplete resection of the tumor is the only curative treatment, but pancreatic cancer is seldom detected at an early stage, as 40% of patients present with distant metastases and 40\\n% present with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), which is unresectable. When there are no distant metastases, the resectability mainly depends on the local status determine\\nd by: These subjects will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter on staging. \\nBased on the imaging findings the tumor can be categorized as resectable, borderline resectable or unresectable.\\nStaging:\\nAssessment of vascular involvement:\\nInvolvement of critical vascular structures is the most important factor, which determines the resectability of a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (figure).\\nAt the same time it is an important predictor of survival. The most commonly used resectability criteria for vascular involvement are the criteria of the  National Comprehensive Can\\ncer Network (NCCN). These criteria however are quite complex and that is why several other criteria exist.\\nFor instance in the Netherlands we use the criteria of the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group (DPCG). We will first discuss the DPCG criteria followed by the NCCN criteria. Whatever crit\\neria you use, you need to realize that assessment of resectability can be subjective and varies between institutions, especially in the case of portovenous reconstructions.\\nDPCG resectability criteria:\\nThe criteria of the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group for vascular compromise are relatively simple compared to the NCCN criteria and that is why we present these criteria first (table)\\n. The resectability is also determined by the presence of distant metastases and the lymph node status in which extraregional lymph nodes are regarded as distant metastases. Importa\\nnt additional findings of interest to the surgeon, that are easily overlooked are: These findings will be discussed in the next chapter.\\nNCCN resectability criteria:\\nLocally irresectable is synonym to locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Assessing the degree of circumferential vascular involvement is done in 90 degree steps.\\nLess than 180 degrees contact is called abutment and more than 180 degrees contact is called encasement. The probability of vascular invasion is 40% for abutment and 80% for encasem\\nent, up to 100% when the tumor is completely surrounding the portal vein or SMV. In case of venous involvement the length of invasion is also mentioned as this may guide the surgeon\\n in assessing the possibility of reconstruction. The specificity of CT for detecting vascular invasion ranges from 82-100% and sensitivity from 70-96%. The use of multiplanar reform\\nations improves overall CT performance as seen in this case. A coronal reformat shows a small tumor in the pancreatic head (arrowheads) with obstruction of the common bile duct. The\\nre seems to be just limited contact with the portal vein (arrow).\\nContinue with the next images. A multiplanar reformat perpendicular to the portal vein shows that there is more extensive contact with the portal vein, 90 – 180 degrees (arrow). Wit\\nhout contour irregularity this is classified as borderline resectable according to the DPCG criteria but resectable according to the NCCN criteria. Resection without venous reconstr\\nuction proved to be R1, meaning presence of microscopic tumor invasion of the resection margin. Teardrop sign. A large tumor in the body of the pancreas, 90 – 180 degrees contact wi\\nth the SMV, but moreover deformation of the SMV into a so called teardrop, highly suspicious for invasion.

There is encasement of the celiac arte\\nry for 360º degrees (arrow in A). The axial MIP at the level of the celiac artery shows narrowing of the encased common hepatic artery (arrow), highly suspicious for invasion.\\nLocation:\\n65% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas are located within the head, 15% in the corpus and 10% in the tail. The remaining 10% being multifocal or diffuse (figure). Tumors of the head usua\\nlly present earlier due to obstructive jaundice. Tumors of the body and tail tend to present late and they are associated with a worse prognosis.\\nT-stage:\\nT-staging has been simplified in the AJCC TNM-8 criteria. The T-stage does not determine whether a tumor ia resectable or not, but has merely prognostic implications. T2 and T3 cate\\ngories are now based on size only and extrapancreatic extension is no longer part of the definition.\\nThe rationale being that size-based definitions are more objective as it is difficult to determine extrapancreatic extension. T4 categorization is now based on involvement of the ar\\nteries.\\nResectability has been removed from the definition as resectability can be subjective and variable between institutions.\\nN-stage:\\nIt is important to discriminate between regional lymph nodes and extra regional lymph nodes (distant metastases).\\nThe main extraregional locations are para-aortic and to the left of the SMA. Suspicious nodes in these locations should be documented and sampled. In this illustration we use the ly\\nmph node stations in pancreatic carcinoma as proposed by the Japan Pancreas Society.\\nA complete list is provided in the chapter on reporting. Click here.

The sensitivity of CT for detecting lymph node metastases is poor, around 15\\n% based on a size criterium of >10mm short-axis alone. The reason for this poor sensitivity is that small regional lymph nodes often harbor metastases, while large lymph nodes can b\\ne reactive. Adding morphological features like rounded shape, heterogeneity, central necrosis and absence of fatty hilum, still results in a poor sensitivity with values no greater \\nthan 30%. Axial CT (a) shows multipele para-aortic lymph nodes, up to a short-axis of 10mm (primary tumor in the pancreas not shown). CT guided biopsy of a low left para-aortic lymp\\nh node was performed.

Next to distant lymph node metastases these are mainly hepatic (20-75%), peritoneal (9%) \\nand pulmonary (<10%). Liver metastases frequently present as multiple lesions less than 10mm in size and are predominantly in a subcapsular location. It has been hypothesized that t\\nhis is a form of peritoneal spread. Subsequently the sensitivity of CT for detecting liver metastases is low, around 75%. Furthermore over 50% of hepatic metastases are diagnosed wi\\nthin 6 months of resection of the primary tumor, suggesting synchronous disease and being already present at the time of initial staging. Images\\nThe images show an axial CT (a,b) with a resectable tumor in the pancreatic head, with no signs of liver metastases.\\nThe patient was randomized for neaoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the PREOPANC-2 trial.\\nMRI for radiotherapyplanning (DWI shown in c,d) within several weeks of CT showed over 10 liver metastases.

In\\ndoubtful cases laparoscopy may confirm the diagnosis.\\nAdditional findings of interest to the surgeon:\\nNext to the assessment of vascular involvement the invasion of other\\nsurrounding structures and organs should be examined (see checklist). Some\\nof which are directly invaded and don’t\\npreclude resection (for instance duodenal invasion, which is taken out in a\\nWhipple procedure.)\\nBut both spread to the\\ntransverse mesocolon and root of the mesentery are commonly overlooked and may\\nwarrant extended resections or lead to irresectability.\\nPerineural invasion:\\nPerineural spread is a common finding in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and seen in more than half of the cases.\\nIt is an important prognostic factor for early recurrence and metastatic disease. On CT it is detected as infiltrating soft tissue from the edge of the tumor along known specific pe\\nripancreatic neural pathways, which extend from the pancreatic head to the SMA, celiac trunc and the common hepatic artery. Even in small tumors this can lead to unresectable diseas\\ne. Perineural invasion (2)\\nThe axial image shows a double duct sign (arrowheads).\\nAlthough a mass in the pancreatic head is not seen, we must assume that there is a small tumor in the pancreatic head. On both the axial and coronal images there is extensive soft t\\nissue infiltration from the medial side of the pancreatic head toward the SMA (yellow arrows).

Invasion\\nof the transverse mesocolon does not necessarily preclude resection, but since additional\\nhemicolectomy might be needed this is essential pre-operative information.\\nVariations of arterial anatomy:\\nAnatomic variations:\\nWhat we regard as the normal hepatic arterial anatomy is seen in only 55% of the population (figure). Variations of the hepatic arterial anatomy are seen in approximately 40-45%. An\\nomalous arteries may run in close proximity to the head of the pancreas, which predisposes them to tumor extension or predisposes them to iatrogenic injury during surgery. Hepatic a\\nrteries with an anomalous origin can either be accessory or replaced. An accessory right hepatic artery is an extra right hepatic artery, while a replaced right hepatic artery has a\\nn anomalous origin and replaces the proper right hepatic artery (figure).\\nThe most common variations are demonstrated in the illustration. In patients planned for pancreatic surgery, it is important to look especially for an anomalous origin of the right \\nor common hepatic artery. These arteries originate from the right side of the SMA and run in close proximity to the head of the pancreas, which predisposes them to tumor extension o\\nr iatrogenic injury. \\nThe reported frequencies of these specific anomalies are 11-21% and 0.5-5%. Replaced right hepatic artery The axial CT shows a accessory right hepatic artery (yellow arrow) running \\nin close proximity to a hypodense mass in the pancreatic head (arrowhead). The vascular involvement is better appreciated on the sagittal reconstruction. There is 90 – 180° abutment\\n of the replaced right hepatic artery (white arrow) by a pancreatic head adenocarcinoma (white arrowhead). \\nThe native left hepatic artery is seen in a more anterior course, the portal vein in between.

Celiac trunc stenosis with collateral bloodflow to the hepatic artery via the pancreaticoduodenal arcade.\\nArterial stenosis:\\nNext step in the preoperative evaluation is to look for a stenosis of the celiac artery, which is observed in 2-8% of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. \\nCeliac artery stenosis can either be caused by compression of the median arcuate ligament or atherosclerotic disease. A significant stenosis of the celiac artery is usually overcome\\n by collateral bloodflow from the SMA, via the peripancreatic arcade (of Buhler) and retrograde flow in the gastroduodenal artery. Since the gastroduodenal artery is resected during\\n pancreaticoduodenectomy the arterial blood supply to the liver is at risk if a celiac artery stenosis is not detected preoperatively. Images\\nThe coronal reformat (a) shows a small tumor in the ampullary region (arrowhead), with obstruction of both the common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatic duct (PD). In absence of local i\\nnvasion this is regarded as a resectable lesion. \\nThe axial CT (b) however shows hypertrophy of the peripancreatic arcade (arrows), highly suggestive of a significant stenosis of the celiac trunk. \\nThe celiac trunk stenosis is shown on sagittal MIP (arrow in c). \\nThe collateral bloodflow to the hepatic artery via the pancreaticoduodenal arcade (stippled arrow) is nicely appreciated on a coronal MIP (d).\\nRe-staging after neoadjuvant treatment:\\nFollow-up CT after neoadjuvant therapy shows no disease progression and exploration was performed. In the era of neoadjuvant treatment restaging has become a hot topic and has shown\\n some important restrictions, mainly in the differentiation of remaining fibrosis and vital tumor. Re-staging on CT overestimates tumor size and consequently underestimates response\\n, therefore RECIST measurements have little to no value in the absence of progression. Furthermore vascular involvement is overestimated, persisting in 80% of patients, but possibly\\n being fibrosis instead of vital tumor. Any reduction in vessel-tumor contact has been shown to be significantly associated with R0 resection, suggesting that this finding might be \\nconsidered an indication for surgical resection in suitable candidates. The role of re-staging CT at this time is to rule out disease progression and if so surgical exploration shou\\nld be considered. Data on the additional value of DWI or PET-CT are still limited. Images\\nAxial CT (a) before neoadjuvant treatment shows a tumor on the medial side of the pancreatic head (arrowhead), irresectable based on extensive perineural growth with 360 degrees enc\\nasement of the SMA (arrow in b, coronal reformat). \\nFollow-up CT after 8 cycli of FOLFIRINOX (c,d) shows stable disease with persistent encasement of the SMA.

The bursa consists of two bursal leaves. The outer and in\\nner leaves are fused with the deltoid muscle fascia and rotator cuff, respectively. The bursal leaves can easily glide over each other, thus facilitating the range of movement of th\\ne shoulder. Blind subacromial injection of drugs into the subacromial bursa is a frequently performed therapy by general practitioners and orthopedic surgeons.

The joint space between the radial head and the capitulum is easily pa\\nlpated. The hand is pronated or may be turned into the thumb up position, which is necessary to open the joint maximally. The transducer is placed over the joint visualizing the joi\\nnt space. The needle (22 gauge, 30 mm) is directed at a slight craniocaudal angle on the dorsolateral side of the joint toward the joint space aiming toward the articular surface of\\n the radial head. When seen to have entered the joint and upon feeling the cartilage of the radial head, the needle is slightly pulled back to ensure that the bevel is free from the\\n cartilage and facing into the joint. 5-8 mL of contrast media is injected.

In some cases it may be helpful to hold the wrist in ulnar deviation in order to open the\\n joint space even more. The space between the radius and the scaphoid is identified on ultrasound. A 23-25-gauge, 30 mm needle is advanced under ultrasound guidance into the joint d\\nirected toward the articular surface of the radius until one feels contact with the radius. After ensuring that the tip of the needle is free from the radial cartilage 2-4 mL contra\\nst is injected. The bevel of the needle is facing toward the joint space and the contrast is seen to flow into the joint.\\nDistal radioulnar joint (DRUJ):\\nA linear array transducer is axially positioned dorsally over the distal radius and ulna. Along the short axis of the transducer a 23-25- gauge, 30 mm needle is inserted being direc\\nted from proximally to distally in a caudal direction. A total amount of 0.5-1 mL is injected according to rising pressure during injection.\\nCarpal, carpometacarpal and interphalangeal joints:\\nPhysicians and specialists routinely perform intra-articular punctures and injections on small wrist and finger joints to relieve joint effusion or to inject drugs. The failure rate\\n and frequency of occurrence of peri-articular injections are high: 15% - 32%, especially with the joints of the little finger and the DIP joints. Unintended peri-articular drug inj\\nection moreover may affect the surrounding ligaments or tendons, leading to serious complications. A dorsal approach using a 23-25-gauge needle is preferable. Although high-frequenc\\ny linear array transducers with frequencies from 18 to 12 MHz are often used for scanning the superficial soft tissue structures of the wrist and hand, a small footprint transducer \\nmay allow better access to the small peripheral joints. Generally, 0.5-1 mL of contrast material is instilled after confir- mation of correct needle placement.\\nSacroiliac Joint:\\nThe sacroiliac joint has been implicated as a source of low back and lower extremity pain, which is thought to be caused by sacroiliitis. Treatment consists of intra-articular injec\\ntion of corticosteroids. Diagnostic injections or blocks are frequently performed, to distinguish between the probable causes of low back pain, because in 15-25% this is generated b\\ny the SI joint. Upper level SI joint injection The axially orientated transducer is moved from the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra caudally, depicting the dorsal surface of the s\\nacrum with the median and lateral sacral crest, the gluteal surface of the ilium, and the first posterior sacral foramen. The needle is inserted along the short axis of the transduc\\ner into the hypoechoic cleft located between the surface of the sacrum and the contour of the ilium. Angulations of needle insertion are adjusted to the orientation of the hypoechoi\\nc cleft of the SI joint, which presents cranially a more medial to lateral orientation, and caudally a more vertical orientation. Lower level SI joint injection From the upper level\\n the transducer is moved downward by delineation of the median and lateral sacral crest, at the dorsal surface of the sacrum and the gluteal surface of the ilium until the second po\\nsterior sacral foramen is visualized. As with the upper level, the needle is inserted into the hypoechoic cleft between the sacrum and ilium.\\nHip:\\nThe patient is placed supine. The leg is held in slight endorotation and abduction thereby reducing tension on the capsular structures and moving the iliopsoas tendon and bursa medi\\nally out of the intended needle path.\\nPreferably a 5-3.5 MHz curved array transducer is used, which provides the necessary penetration depth.\\nUsually a 21 gauge needle with a length of 9 cm is used for the average adult. In smaller adults or children a 23-gauge, 5 cm hypodermic needle might be used. Local anaesthetic may \\nbe injected prior to the main injection but this entails extra manipulation as well as non-contrast fluid (anaesthetic) in the joint leaving less room for the contrast in the limite\\nd joint space as well as possibly 2 punctures. The needle may inadvertently be withdrawn from the joint after anaesthetic injection during the switch to connect the syringe with con\\ntrast. This could be avoided by using a three-way connector between the two syringes containing the anaesthetic and the injection fluid (contrast or medication).\\nThe needle is advanced at a caudo-cranial angle along the long axis of the transducer aiming for the anterior recess near the junction of the femoral neck with the femoral head (see\\n US and illustration). The bevel of the needle should be facing toward the joint.\\nWhen the needle makes contact with the femoral head-neck junction it is slightly retracted to prevent inadvertently injection underneath the synovial fold of the hip joint capsule (\\nsee drawing).\\nIf correctly positioned within the joint capsule, 10-15 mL contrast media or medication is injected and the anterior recess will distend by the injected fluid confirming the intra-a\\nrticular positioning.\\nKnee:\\nIndications for CT or MR arthrography of the knee are evaluation of the post-operative meniscus, query intra-articular bodies, evaluation of the stability of osteochondral lesions a\\nnd evaluation of articular cartilage. One may also be requested to inject medication such as corticosteroids and/or a local anaesthetic. For injection we do not use ultrasound guida\\nnce but use the standard \"blind\" procedure introducing the needle (21-gauge, 50 mm) behind the patella using a lateral midpatellar approach. The patella is lateralized and the needl\\ne introduced from the mid lateral side aiming toward the centre of the patella indicated by the left forefinger. The needle is introduced horizontally aiming posterior to the centre\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 205}),\n",

Prior to CT\\n or MR one can choose to apply a tight bandage above the patella thereby forcing contrast from the suprapatellar recess into the joint space proper.\\nAnkle and foot:\\nThe foot is slightly plantar flexed. The long axis of the transducer is indicated by the grey line on the side, being in a sagittal plane.\\nTibiotalar joint:\\nCT or MR arthrography may be used to query ligamentous, osteochondral or chondral injury, eval- uation for free bodies or query stability of ostechondral lesions. For injection of t\\nhe ankle (tibiotalar joint) the patient is supine with the foot in slight plantar flexion. The medial side of the tibiotalar joint is investigated anteriorly with ultrasound to dete\\nr- mine a suitable place for injection, at the same time checking for any excessive joint fluid. We use a small curved array 8 MHz transducer but if preferred one can use an 18-12 M\\nHz linear array transducer. The long axis of the probe is held in a sagittal plane. Sonogram showing the needle (arrow) and the needle tip (arrowhead) and the injected contrast medi\\na in the tibiotalar joint. The needle, usually 22-gauge (length: 30 mm), is introduced in line with the long imaging axis of the transducer on the medial side of the anterior joint \\nspace, medial to the anterior tibial ligament, avoiding ligaments and vessels. One should identify the talar dome and the overhanging anterior tibial lip. The needle is angled caudo\\n-cranially into the joint under the ventral lip of the distal tibia aiming for the articular surface of the distal tibia. Contact is felt and once again one ensures that the needle \\ntip is free from the tibial cartilage and that the bevel is facing into the joint. 8-10 ml of contrast is injected into the tibiotalar joint and one sees the anterior capsule swells\\n up with the fluid. There should be no resistance to injection or pain experienced by the patient.\\nPosterior subtalar joint:\\nThe subtalar or talocalcaneal joint is composed of 3 facets: a broad posterior facet representing the primary articulating surface, a medially located middle facet in which the sust\\nentaculum tali articulates with the medial process of the talus, and an anterior facet. Subtalar arthrography may be performed via an anterolat- eral, posterolateral or posteromedia\\nl approach. 2-4 ml of contrast material is injected into the posterior subtalar joint. Schematic drawing in a coronal view of the right sinus tarsi. Displayed are the course and att\\nachment sites of the cervical ligament (1); the interosseous talo- calcaneal ligament (2); and the medial (3), intermediate (4), and lateral (5) roots of the inferior extensor retin\\naculum.\\nSinus tarsi:\\nThe sinus tarsi is a cone-shaped cavity that courses in a postero- medial to anterolateral direction. It is located in the lateral aspect of the foot between the neck of the talus a\\nnd the anterosuperior surface of the calcaneus. The tarsal sinus continues medially as the tarsal canal, which is a funnel-shaped space between the talus and the calcaneus. It conta\\nins fat, an arterial anastomosis, joint cap- sules, nerve endings, and five ligamentous structures-the medial, intermediate, and lateral roots of the inferior extensor retinaculum; \\nthe cervical ligament; and the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament (figure). This space can be the cause of foot pain in the sinus tarsi syn- drome. The first step in treatment is i\\nnfiltration of the sinus tarsi with a mixture of Depomedrol and local anaesthetic (Lidocaine). This can be challenging for the surgeon in a non-guided approach but is reasonably eas\\nily and accurately achieved with ultrasound guidance. US-guided injection of the sinus tarsi at the right-hand side with a lateral approach. The transducer is held in a coronal obli\\nque plane. The needle is introduced along the long axis of the transducer. The sinus tarsi can easily be visualized using ultrasound. The patient turns onto the contralateral side l\\naying the foot to be treated with its medial surface against the table top, the lateral side of the foot being uppermost. The transducer is held in a coronaloblique plane with regar\\nds to the foot. The sinus tarsi is identified as a triangular space between the anterior process of the calcaneus and the talar neck. The tip of the needle (arrow head) is seen with\\nin the cone shaped sinus tarsi, which is bordered by the talus (T) and calcaneus (C). Depending on the degree of inflammation there may be hyperemia of the space and there may be in\\ntervening vessels visible, which one wishes to avoid.

The small size of the glenoid fossa and the relative laxity of the \\njoint capsule renders the joint relatively unstable and prone to subluxation and dislocation. MR is the best imaging modality to examen patients with shoulder pain and instability. \\nIn Shoulder MR-Part I we will focus on the normal anatomy and the many anatomical variants that may simulate pathology. In part II we will discuss shoulder instability. In part III \\nwe will focus on impingement and rotator cuff tears.\\nIntroduction:\\nLateral view of right shoulder The glenohumeral joint has the following supporting structures: Anterior view The tendon of the subscapularis muscle attaches both to the lesser tuber\\nosity aswell as to the greater tuberosity giving support to the long head\\nof the biceps in the bicipital groove. Dislocation of the long head of the biceps will inevitably result in rupture of part of the subscapularis tendon. The rotator cuff is made of \\nthe tendons of subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscle. Posterior view The supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscles and tendons are shown. The\\ny all attach to the greater tuberosity. The rotator cuff muscles and tendons act to stabilize the shoulderjoint during movements. Without the rotator cuff, the humeral head would ri\\nde up partially out of the glenoid fossa, lessening the efficiency of the deltoid muscle. Large tears of the rotator cuff may allow the humeral head to migrate upwards resulting in \\na high riding humeral head.\\nNormal anatomy:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nAxial anatomy and checklist:\\nAt this level look for SLAP-lesions and variants like sublabral foramen.

Tears of the supraspinatus tendon are best seen on coronal obliqu\\ne and ABER-series. In many cases the axis of the supraspinatus tendon (arrowheads) is rotated more anteriorly compared to the axis of the muscle (yellow arrow). When you plan the co\\nronal oblique series, it is best to focus on the axis of the supraspinatus tendon.

In the ABER position the inferior glenohumeral ligament is stretched resulting in tension on the anteroinferior labrum, allowing intra-articular\\n contrast to get between the labral tear and the glenoid. Rotator cuff tears The ABER view is also very useful for both partial- and full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff. The ab\\nduction and external rotation of the arm releases tension on the cuff relative to the normal coronal view obtained with the arm in adduction. As a result, subtle articular-sided par\\ntial thickness tears will not lie apposed to the adjacent intact fibers of the remaining rotator cuff\\nnor be effaced against the humeral head, and intra-articular contrast can enhance visualization of the tear (3).

These normal variants are all located in the 11-3 o'clock position. It is important to recognise these variants, becaus\\ne they can mimick a SLAP tear. These normal variants will usually not mimick a Bankart-lesion, since it is located at the 3-6 o'clock position, where these normal variants do not oc\\ncur. However labral tears may originate at the 3-6 o'clock position and subsequently extend superiorly.\\nSublabral recess:\\nThere are 3 types of attachment of the superior labrum at the 12 o'clock position where the biceps tendon inserts. In type I there is no recess between the glenoid cartilage and the\\n labrum. In type II there is a small recess. In type III there is a large sublabral recess. This sublabral recess can be difficult to distinguish from a SLAP-tear or a sublabral for\\namen. These images illustrate the differences between an sublabral recess and a SLAP-tear. A recess more than 3-5 mm is always abnormal and should be regarded as a SLAP-tear. Sublab\\nral recess The image shows the typical findings of a sublabral recess.\\nSublabral Foramen:\\nA sublabral foramen or sublabral hole is an unattached anterosuperior labrum at the 1-3 o'clock position. It is seen in 11% of individuals. On a MR-arthtrogram a sublabral foramen s\\nhould not be confused with a sublabral recess or SLAP-tear, which are also located in this region. A sublabral recess however is located at the site of the attachment of the biceps \\ntendon at 12 o'clock and does not extend to the 1-3 o'clock position. A SLAP tear may extend to the 1-3 o'clock position, but the attachment of the biceps tendon to the superior lab\\nrum should always be involved.

The anterosuperior labrum is absent in the 1-3 o'clock position and the middle glenohumeral ligament is usually thickened. It is pre\\nsent in approximately 1.5% of individuals. On these axial images a Buford complex can be identified. The anterior labrum is absent in the 1-3 o'clock position and there is a thicken\\ned middle GHL.

It is present in 5% of the population. Usually it is an incidental finding and regarded a\\ns a normal variant. The os acromiale may cause impingement because if it is unstable, it may be pulled inferiorly during abduction by the deltoid, which attaches here. On MR an os a\\ncromiale is best seen on the superior axial images. An os acromiale must be mentioned in the report, because in patients who are considered for subacromial decompression,\\nthe removal of the acromion distal to the synchondrosis may further destabilize the synchondrosis and allow for\\neven greater mobility of the os acromiale after surgery and worsening of the impingement (4).

In this article we will discuss the basics of RECIST. The criteria to determin\\ne whether a tumor disappears, shrinks, stays the same or gets bigger are complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). More inform\\nation is given in the article RECIST 1.1 and more in which we will discuss RECIST 1.1 in more detail and discuss other response systems.\\nIntroduction:\\nRECIST is a standard way to measure the response of a tumor to treatment. CT is the preferred modality for the baseline study. The baseline scan should be done within 4 weeks before\\n treatment starts and slice thickness ⩽ 5 mm and i.v. contrast are mandatory. Choose target lesions (max 5) that are easy to measure and calculate the sum of the longest diameters (\\nSLD). Identify non-target lesions like ascites or pleural fluid that are not suited for exact measurements, but that can be followed. In the follow up study compare the SLD of the t\\narget lesions and determine the presence or abcense of the non-target lesions and look for new lesions. Then determine whether there is complete response, partial response, stable d\\nisease or progressive disease. Any new lesion means progressive disease. The response criteria can be seen in the table. The sum of longest diameters of the target lesions (SLD) in \\nthe follow up scan has to be compared with the baseline and the smallest SLD during treatment, called the ‘nadir'. The absolute increase of SLD should be ≥ 5mm to be called progress\\nive disease.\\nTarget lesions:\\nExamples of target lesions Tumors Choose preferably large well-described lesions to measure  with a longest diameter ≥ 10 mm, a maximum of two per organ and a maximum of five for th\\ne whole study. Lymph nodes Lymph nodes can be used as target lesions provided that the maximum short axis diameter exceeds 15 mm. Examples of target lesions: Lymph nodes <10 mm are \\nregarded as normal. Lymph nodes 10-14mm are regarded as pathologic, but not suited for target lesions.\\nThey can be used as non-target lesions. When target lymph nodes decrease to a normal size (<10 mm), their measurements still have to be included in the sum of the longest diamters (\\nSLD). Special notes on defining target lesions\\nSum of Longest Diameters:\\nHere an example of a 28-year-old male with a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the appendix. There are 5 lesions suited for measurement: The SLD = diameter of 1+2+3+4+5.\\nNon-target lesions:\\nDuring follow up there is unequivocal progression of lymph node metastases, which were choosen as non-target lesions Non-target lesions are: Examples of non-target lesions: You do n\\not measure non-target lesions, but make a good estimate. In the follow up there are 3 possibilities: Here another example of progression of non-target lesions. CT images in a 73-yea\\nr-old male with progressive liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. At baseline the liver metastases were too small to be used as target lesions and consequently they were used as\\n non-target lesions.\\nAt follow up there is unequivocal progressions. Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions means progressive disease, even if there is partial response or even disappearance of t\\nhe target lesions.\\nNew lesions:\\nAny new lesion means progressive disease. Do consider “new” lesions in an area of the body that was not imaged during baseline (for example brain metastases) as truly “new”, thereby\\n forcing overall response to progressive disease. CT-images in a 81-year-old female with endometrial carcinoma and occurrence of new liver metastases during treatment with chemother\\napy. Courtesy Els van Persijn van Meerten. Any new lesion means progressive disease, but not every newly detected lesion is always a true new lesion. In osteolytic bone metastases i\\nt can be difficult to determine if a sclerotic lesion that is detected during follow up is truly a new lesion. The sclerotic bone lesions in b and d are not new metastases but an os\\nteoblastic reaction to the therapy.\\nResponse assessment:\\nThis table is the same as the table in the introduction, but demonstrates the overall treatment response with varying responses in the three lesions categories.\\nSpecial remarks:\\nThe orientation of the liver metastasis has changed during follow up.\\nDo's:\\nThe sclerotic bone lesions in b and d are not new metastases but an osteoblastic reaction. Courtesy Els van Persijn van Meerten.\\nDon'ts:\\nFragmentation of lesions:\\nIf a lesion breaks into separate fragments between baseline and follow-up, the sum of longest diameters (SLD) of the fragments should be calculated. Obviously, the short axis diamet\\ner is measured for lymph nodes. At follow up the lung metastasis is too small to measure. A default value of 5mm is assigned.\\nToo small to measure:\\nAt each response evaluation each target lesions should be measured, even when they are very small (e.g. 2 mm). If a target lesion has disappeared record a measurement of 0 mm. If th\\ne lesion is too small to measure (faintly seen and not possible to give an exact measurement) assign a default value of 5 mm to prevent false responses or progression (derived from \\nthe 5 mm CT slice thickness). The images are of a patient with a primary lung tumour.\\nAt baseline, the longest diameter is well above 10 mm, therefore this was assigned as a target lesion. \\nDuring follow-up the long-axis diameter dropped below 10 mm, which is the lower limit for considering a lesion as target lesion. \\nHowever, since this is a follow-up measurement, the target lesion still counts up to the sum of the diameters (SLD) and a default value of 5mm was assigned.\\nCavitating lesions:\\nCavitation can occur during treatment. \\nCavitating lesions should be continuously measured in their longest diameter. \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 208}),\n",

This review focusses on the \\ncomplimentary roles that CT and MR play in the assessment of: Fibro-osseous lesions Role of CT and MRI\\nRole of CT and MRI:\\nCT is of value for determining anatomic landmarks and variants. This information is of vital importance to the ENT-surgeon. In addition, we need it to identify erosive processes and\\n acquired developmental deficiencies of the bone. CT is also excellent for determining whether there is intraorbital extension of sino-nasal disease\\nin the ventral 2/3 of the orbit. When pathology approaches the orbital apex, an MRI study is necessary to assess spread to the cavernous sinus and intracranial compartment. CT is pe\\nrformed without contrast medium. If additional imaging is necessary, orbital MRI is the next step. Allergic fungal sinusitis - unenhanced CT The real value of unenhanced CT is the f\\nollowing: if you see an opacified sinus with hyperdense contents, it is usually a sign of benign disease.\\nTumor is not hyper-dense. The hyperdensity is due to one or a combination of the following: On the left you see a case that was initially interpreted as a tumor. There is hyperdense\\n material in the posterior right ethmoid, the bilateral spheno-ethmoidal recesses, the sphenoid sinus and there is involvement of the clivus. The hyperdensity is a good prognostic s\\nign, indicating a benign process. This is an example of allergic fungal sinusitis. Usually it is more anteriorly located. Allergic fungal sinusitis - unenhanced CT On the left anoth\\ner, more characteristic, example of allergic fungal sinusitis. There is bilateral opacification of the nasal cavities, usually a sign of an inflammatory process or polyps. \\nNote the concentric lamellated appearance of alternating hyper- and hypodensity in the maxillary sinusses. The hyperdensity is due to inspissated secretions and fungal elements. The\\n hypodensity reflects cysts, mucosal disease, and granulation tissue.\\n In the ethmoidal region some of the hyper-density reflects periostitis and neo-osteogenesis along the septae. The signal intensity of sinus secretions depends on the protein conten\\nt\\nSignal characteristics of secretions:\\nMRI is extremely helpful in complicated sinonasal disease. MRI can discern secretions and mucosa from masses. When you understand the signal characteristics, you are readily able to\\n distinguish soft tissues masses from inspissated secretions. The signal intensity of secretions can vary and mainly depends on the ratio of water to protein and the viscosity. Diff\\nerent protein contents result in different signal intensities on T1 and T2W-images (figure). Fungus usually has a high protein content of more than 28% and can mimic an aerated sinu\\ns because it is low on T1- and T2WI. You need CT to make the distinction! MRI is also useful for determining invasion of the skull base. Involvement of the skull base is seen as rep\\nlacement of the high signal of the fatty marrow on T1WI by hypointense signal of the tumor. Also look for foraminal extension, whether by perineural spread or direct invasion of the\\n tumor. MRI is also the study of choice for detecting intracranial extension of sinonasal disease. Pseudo-pneumatized sinus\\nPseudo-pneumatized sinus:\\nRole of CT and MR (2) On the left a T2W-image in an immuno-compromised patient with fever. Initially a MRI was performed to rule out sinusitis. Notice the low signal intensity of th\\ne left sphenoid sinus, which also had a low signal intensity on the T1W-image (not shown). Continue with the CT. Pseudo-pneumatized sinus on MR. Beware of fungus! The CT clearly sho\\nws the opacified sinus, which is slightly hyperdense. The signal characteristics on MRI and the attentuation on CT are a result of the high protein content of fungus. This is a good\\n example of the pitfall of the 'pseudo-pneumatized sinus' . This is an example of an Actinomyes infection. So, when invasive fungal infection is suspected,  start with a CT, then mo\\nve on to MRI to rule out spread to the eye, cavernous sinus and intracranial compartment!\\nEnhancement:\\nIn general bright signal on T2 is a sign of benign disease, since fluid and mucosal disease usually have a high water content. Secretions do not have solid enhancement. If you have \\nan enhancing mass, you must rule out tumor. On the left an example of infectious sinonasal disease. On the pre-contrast scan you see relatively high signal content of the maxillary \\nsinusses due to proteineous material. After the administration of i.v. contrast there is only enhancement of the circumferential mucosa and no solid enhancement. Lymphoma of sphenoi\\nd sinus and skull base Role of CT and MR (3) In complicated cases both CT and MR are needed to demonstrate the extention of the disease.

There is opacification of the sphenoid sinus with destruction of and osteopenia of the sphenoid bone. CT nicely demonstrates the bone destruction and some of the \\nsoft tissue involvement. Continue with the MR-images. Lymphoma of sphenoid sinus and skull base On the left the corresponding MRI. First study the images, then continue reading. The\\n findings are: Continue with the coronal images. Lymphoma of sphenoid sinus and skull base Coronal images of the same patient: T1 pre-and post-contrast. Normal aspect of the right M\\neckel's cave, tissue in the left Meckel's cave extending into the cavernous sinus (blue arrow). The red arrow points to the dural margin of the cavernous sinus: there is enhancement\\n on both sides of the dura. The disease wraps around the temporal lobe (green arrow) and extents downward in the foramen ovale (yellow arrow) and into the masticator space. The aste\\nrix indicates normal non-enhancing tissue in the masticator space. This patient had a lymphoma. Nine out of ten times an immunocompromised patient will have a fungal infection, in o\\nne out of ten it will be a lymphoma. CT and MR have a complimentary role in this case, but finally a biopsy is called for to differentiate between these two diagnoses, because of di\\nfferent treatment. Sinonasal carcinoma Role of CT and MR (4) On the left images of a 64-yrs-old, immuno-competent patient, who had a follow-up scan for left-sided vestibular neuroma\\n. On the image on the left hypointense tissue is seen in the pterygo-palatine fossa and videan canal (yellow arrow). On the image on the right, which is more cranial, there is hypoi\\nntense tissue in the pterygo-maxillary fissure and pterygo-palatine fossa. Continue with the contrast-enhanced T1W-image. Sinonasal carcinoma There is solid enhancement of the abnor\\nmality. The differential diagnosis again consists of 2 catagories: neoplasm and chronic invasive fungal infection. In an immuno-competent patient, a neoplasm is much more likely. Co\\nntinue with the CT-images. Sinonasal carcinoma This is the corresponding CT, performed not to make the diagnosis, but to assess the condition of the adjacent bony structures, especi\\nally the sphenoid sinus. Also, it serves to guide the endoscopist for intraoperative biospy. There is extensive destruction of the skull base. Sinonasal carcinoma The coronal image \\nillustrates a normal foramen rotundum on the left (yellow arrow), which on the right has been obliterated by soft tissue. There is extensive bone destruction, and a possible area fo\\nr biopsy is indicated by the blue arrow. At biopsy the diagnosis of a spindle cell carcinoma was made.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 209}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Complications of Sinusitis:\\nWhen assessing the complications of sinusitis, CT is excellent for imaging of subperiostial abscesses or orbital extension into the ventral 2/3 of the orbit. MRI is necessary for as\\nsessing intracranial complications, such as brain or epidural abscesses, subdural empyema or sinus thrombosis. Brain abscess\\nBrain abscess:\\nOn the left images of a patient was initially diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme.\\nThere are abnormalities in both frontal lobes. Notice however the abnormal tissue in the frontal sinus (yellow arrow), subperiosteal abscess (red arrow) and the fluid-fluid level (g\\nreen arrow) in the large intracranial lesion which has ring enhancement. All abnormalities are continuous meaning there is frontal bony destruction. The restricted diffusion also su\\npports the diagnosis of brain abscess. This is a subperiosteal abscess and osteomyelitis of the frontal bone, usually with a soft tender swelling of the forehead. This is also calle\\nd Pott's puffy tumor after Sir Pott, an English surgeon who first described this entity. Brain abscess Brain abscess (2) On the left images of another patient, who had recently been\\n treated for sinusitis and now presented with a seizure.\\nThe CT shows an abnormality in the left temporal lobe with shaggy thick rim enhancement, and a large amount of vasogenic edema.\\nThis is also a brain abscess, most probably due to reflux of bacteria into cranial veins and the venous plexus around the cavernous sinus. Mucocele\\nMucocele:\\nMucoceles are benign, locally expansile paranasal sinus masses most commonly found in the frontal sinus. Secondary to obstruction of the sinus ostia, there is accumulation of fluid \\nwithin a mucoperiosteal lined cavity, resulting in erosion and remodelling of the surrounding bone. The most common causes of mucoceles are chronic infection, allergic sinonasal dis\\nease, trauma and previous surgery. The most common location of a mucocele is the fronto-ethmoidal sinus, followed by the sphenoid sinus. \\nThe least common location is the maxillary sinus. On the left a patient with an uncommon cause of a mucocele. Notice the obstructing solid mass at the frontal ethmoidal junction (ye\\nllow arrows). Mucocele secondary to obstructing tumor Pre- and post-contrast MRI of the same patient. The mucocele shows high signal intensity on T1W (benign finding). The mass in t\\nhe ethmoidal region is hypointense and solidly enhancing. Mucocele (2) The case on the left shows two classic complications of frontal facial trauma. The bilateral nasal fractures a\\nre the clue to a traumatic etiology. Looking at the CT scan on the far left you will notice a convex soft tissue mass in the frontal sinus. The corresponding MRI shows a round hyper\\nintense structure in the same location. Study the images on the left and then continue reading. Posttraumatic mucocele and encephalocele Now look again carefully at the far left CT.\\n Did you notice the bony defect on the left side, at the lateral border of the ethmoid air space (yellow arrow)? The MRI shows that there is brain tissue at the site of the defect. \\nThis patient had both a mucocele and an acquired encephalocele. The two most common causes of mucoceles are trauma and chronic inflammation due to blockage of the ostia. Bilateral m\\nucoceles Mucocele (3) This companion case nicely demonstrates bilateral mucoceles. This patient has chronic sinusitis with sino-nasal opacification, mucoid impaction in the maxillar\\ny sinusses and huge bilateral mucoceles. The CT shows hyperdensity and the MRI shows hyperintensity on T2WI, both of which you will remember are benign signs in sino-nasal disease, \\nindicating a proteinaceous substance. There is smooth bone remodelling and elevation of the frontal sinusses, and although it looks as if there is bony destruction at the orbital bo\\nundary of the frontal sinus, usually the surgeon will still see a fine line of bone in place.\\nOrbital Cellulitis and Abscess:\\nLeft is an axial T1WI, right is a coronal T2WI. There is an abnormality on the left side, but to a lesser degree also on the right. Try to determine which structures are involved. T\\nhe yellow arrows point to the naso-lacrimal ducts. The naso-lacrimal sac connects with the duct, which then drains into the inferior meatus. On the left there is peri-orbital pre-se\\nptal soft tissue swelling. On the coronal image there is bilateral high signal at the junction of the nasolacrimal duct and sac, indicative of a fluid collection. On the left side t\\nhere is also edema of the surrounding tissue. Orbital cellulitis and abscess Post-contrast T1WI, axial and coronal. Lateral to the naso-lacrimal ducts on both sides, there are the f\\nluid collections which now show peripheral enhancement. Complicated acute sinusitis The additional images (T2WI) show mucosal disease of the right maxillary sinus and a fluid level \\nin the left maxillary sinus, in addition to extensive ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinus disease. This patient had acute sinusitis which was complicated by orbital cellulitis and dacroc\\nystitis with abscesses. Developmental or inflammatory narrowing of the naso-lacrimal duct is a risk factor for developing dacrocystitis. See the article on Orbital Pathology by Davi\\nd Youssem for more information about orbital and periorbital cellulitis Tension pneumocephalus\\nComplication of FESS:\\nA rare complication of FESS is seen on the images on the left. The Hounsfields Units of the tiny abnormalities that the asterisk points to were around -120. First study the axial im\\nages. Then continue with the coronal images. Tension pneumocephalus There is a bone defect at the fovea ethmoidalis (red arrow). Also there are post-operative changes indicating tha\\nt the patient had undergone FESS. The intracranial air is a complication of FESS. With this complication, usually the patient goes home feeling fine, and then shows up approximately\\n two weeks later with CSF leak and meningitis, due to the defect in the bone and dura. Tension pneumocephalus occurs when air in the head acts like a mass: there is a bony defect wh\\nich lets air in but not out (valve-like function). Every time the patient sneezes, air is forced through the defect into the intra-cranial space, and remains trapped there. At a cer\\ntain moment the amount of air is sufficient to cause mass effect on the surrounding intra-cranial structures.\\nTumor and tumorlike lesions:\\nRole of CT and MR When it comes to imaging of neoplasms of the paranasal sinuses, CT and MRI play complementary roles. It is not about the histology but about answering the question\\n 'is it tumor or not?' and then determining the extent of the disease, for example intracranial or orbital extension. Use MRI to differentiate inspissated secretions from neoplasms.\\n Scanning down to the hyoid bone allows for examination of the levels I and II lymph nodes: about\\n10% of paranasal neoplasms have nodal metastases at presentation. Encephalocele\\nEncephalocele:\\nCoronal T2WI of the patient on the left show an abnormal structure in the right nasal cavity. When you've decided what it is, then stop to think about whether the abnormality is dev\\nelopmental or acquired. This patient has an encephalocele. There are two findings on the images that let you know that this is developmental. First of all, notice the smaller enceph\\nalocele on the left side (green arrow). Acquired encephaloceles are more often than not unilateral. The second clue is the cortical dysplasia (yellow arrow) as part of a migrational\\n abnormality. Acquired encephaloceles (ie after surgery) tend to lead to dead gliotic brain, which would have a high signal intensity on T2WI. The strange looking structure in the l\\neft image (red arrow) is surgical packing, placed there after the involuntary encounter with brain tissue. Encephalocele Sag T1WI. The blue arrow points to the sphenoid sinus which \\nis hyperintense, due to mucoid impaction as a result of obstruction by the encephalocele. Mucocele (blue arrow) secondary to obstructing tumor (yellow arrow)\\nInverted papilloma:\\nInverted papilloma is characterized by inversion of the neoplastic epithelium into the underlying stroma. It presents as a unilateral nasal polyp arising from the lateral nasal wall\\n, usually in the region of the middle meatus and middle turbinate. Extension into the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses is common. It causes non-specific symptoms like nasal congestion \\nor epistaxis. Biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis and because more than 10% of inverted papillomas harbor a squamous cell carcinoma. Inverted papilloma (asterix) pre- and post\\ncontrast MR When you want to differentiate inspissated secretions from neoplasms it is important to have pre- and post-contrast images. If you were to just look at the post-contrast\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 210}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\" study on the right, you might be tempted to think that there was solid enhancement of the mass in the nasal cavity (asterisk) as well as in the ethmoidal and maxillary sinus on the\\n right. Looking at the pre-contrast study, however, you will notice that the contents of the ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses are hyperintense as opposed to the mass in the nasal cav\\nity (the middle meatal region), because the sinuses are filled with inspissated secretions. This solidly enhancing mass is a tumor until proven otherwise. The imaging findings are n\\non-specific and the differential diagnosis includes a polyp or a carcinoma. Biopsy revealed an inverted papilloma. Inverted papilloma Inverted papilloma (2) On the left another pati\\nent who presented with nasal stuffiness. Study the images on the left. Decide for yourself whether you are looking at a solid mass, inspissated secretions, a combination of both or \\nsomething entirely different. The pre-contrast T1WI shows a hyperintense area within the maxillary sinus, corresponding to a proteinaceous substance. Medial to it is an area with hy\\npointense signal similar to the signal in the orbital globes (so probably cystic). The majority of the soft tissue in the right maxillary sinus is relatively hypointense on the pre-\\ncontrast T1WI,\\nbut solidly enhances, meaning tumor. Inverted papilloma in typical location The T2W-image on the left confirms the cystic element (yellow arrow). The coronal CT nicely demonstrates \\nremodelling of the bone and expansion (arrowheads). This proved to be an inverting papilloma. The localisation is rather typical. Sinonasal carcinoma\\nMalignant tumors of the sinonasal tract:\\nMalignant tumors of the sinonasal tract are extremely rare. The clinical presentation is non-specific and often mimics benign disease. As a result a delay in diagnosis is common. 75\\n% of all paranasal sinus tumors are Stage T3 or T4 at the time of diagnosis. Perineural spread is a manifestation of advanced disease and indicates a poor prognosis. On the left an \\naxial MR-image showing a mass in the ethmoids. The MRI shows no intracranial extension. What is the next step? Sinonasal carcinoma A CT is necessary to determine the integrity of th\\ne adjacent bone. Notice the bony destruction of the fovea ethmoidalis and planum sphenoidale. This indicates that this is a malignant lesion and biopsy demonstrated an adenocarcinom\\na. If the patient is a surgical candidate, frontal endoscopic sino-nasal surgery won't be enough and a cranio-facial take-down will also be required. Meningioma\\nMeningioma:\\nA meningioma can spread transcranially. On the left is a patient with a meningioma, which spreads along the anterior clinoid (arrow). Continue with a coronal image more anteriorly. \\nTranscranial spread of meningioma MRI nicely demonstrates how the meningioma spreads down into the sino-nasal cavity. Keratocyst\\nKeratocyst:\\nFirst look at the images on the left. From where is this lesion arising? The lesion is expansile with bone remodelling and there is an obvious relation to a tooth. It is very import\\nant to determine whether or not sinus pathology has an odontogentic origin, simply\\nbecause the surgical approach is different. If odontogentic, the surgery will be done preferably by a maxillofacial surgeon. If approached by a sino-nasal route it won't be removed \\nentirely. This is a keratocyst Keratocyst On the left another case. This patient presented with facial pain. On this contrast-enhanced MRI we see a non-enhancing expansile lesion in\\n the right maxillary sinus. As it doesn't enhance, we know we aren't dealing with tumor. It is tempting to call this a retention cyst and move on to the next case, but a CT is calle\\nd for to make the correct diagnosis. Keratocyst The corresponding CT shows elevation of the maxillary bone (blue arrow). The red arrow in the right image indicates the cyst dissecti\\nng around the root of a tooth. This is also a keratocyst. Silent sinus\\nSilent sinus:\\nOn the left a patient who presented with asymmetric eyes. First study the images and try to describe what is going on. Then continue reading. This film was originally read as ethmoi\\nd sinusitis and post-surgery.\\nHowever, this patient had never undergone sino-nasal surgery. What you in fact see, is adhesion of the middle right turbinate (red arrow) and the uncinate process\\nto the floor of the orbit. There is also volume loss of the right maxillary sinus. This is called the silent sinus syndrome, which consists of painless facial asymmetry and enophtha\\nlmos caused by chronic maxillary sinus atelectasis. The most characteristic imaging feature of the silent sinus syndrome is the inward retraction of the sinus walls into the sinus l\\numen with associated decrease in sinus volume and enlargement of the middle meatus (2).\\nIn many cases the infundibulum is occluded due to lateral retraction of the uncinate process.\\nFibro-osseous Lesions:\\nFibro-osseous lesions are very common incidental findings and often misinterpreted as tumor. CT is usually diagnostic, so when you see a bizarre lesion at the skull-base, think of a\\n fibro-osseous lesion and get an unenhanced CT. The most common skull base lesion is fibrous dysplasia, followed by osteomas. Osteomas are usually located in the sino-nasal cavities\\n. Fibromas are less common and can be ossifying or non-ossifying. Malignancies are rare. Fibrous dysplasia\\nFibrous dysplasia:\\nOn the left images of a patient who was thought to have a chondrosarcoma. On the T2W-images there is a hypointense lesion (yellow arrow) with a cystic component (red arrow). On the \\npre- and post-contrast T1W-images there is solid enhancement of a mass with peripheral enhancement of the cystic portion. Question: what should be the next step? Classic fibrous dys\\nplasia on CT Next step: get a CT! On CT this is classic fibrous dysplasia (FD) with cortical sparing and ground-glass appearance. Many of the fibrous dysplasia lesions in the clivus\\n, skull base or sino-nasal cavity and in children may have large cystic components, so don't let that dissuade you from the diagnosis! Fibrous dysplasia of the middle turbinate Fibr\\nous dysplasia (2) On the left another example of fibrous dysplasia. This lesion originates from the middle turbinate. Fibrous dysplasia Fibrous dysplasia (3) On the left another pat\\nient read as having a soft tissue tumor (yellow arrow) anterior to the temporal bone. Fibrous dysplasia These are the corresponding axial CT images showing classic fibrous dysplasia\\n of the sphenoid wing. The differential diagnosis is a meningioma. Fibrous dysplasia Fibrous dysplasia (4) On the left images of a different patient with soft tissue in the sphenoid\\n sinus on the left, and an abnormality of the left sphenoid wing, which is about 3 times its normal size whilst maintaining its normal shape. On the post-contrast images there is so\\nlid enhancement. Again the diagnosis is fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a very vascular lesion and can enhance avidly. Osteitis of the middle turbinate\\nOsteitis:\\nIn contrast, this is a patient with osteitis of the middle turbinate and ethmoid septae. Note the laminated high density, due to chronic inflammation and recurrent periostal reactio\\nn with neo-osteogenesis around the septae. Osteoma in frontal sinus\\nOsteoma:\\nThis is a patient who had been having brain MRI for the past 1,5 yrs for frontal headaches. On the MRI (not shown) it looked as if the patient had a little mucosal disease of the fr\\nontal sinus. The sinus CT clearly shows an osteoma with a bony defect (arrow) indicating progressive growth. This lesion requires surgical excision. Note: multiple para-nasal osteom\\nas are found in Gardner's syndrome, which also includes cutaneous and soft tissues tumors in addition to colonic polyps with a predilection to malignant degeneration.\\nMonitoring response to therapy:\\nAll the profits of the Radiology Assistant go to Medical Action Myanmar which is run by Dr. Nini Tun and Dr. Frank Smithuis sr, who is a professor at Oxford university and happens t\\no be the brother of Robin Smithuis.

AJR 2002; 178:503-506\\nTemporal Bone Pathology:\\nEric Beek and Frank Pameijer\\nRadiology department of the University Medical Centre of Utrecht, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2009-07-01 The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate imaging findings of common diseases of the temporal bone. CT is the imaging modality of choice for most of \\nthe pathologic conditions of the temporal bone, especially for those of the middle ear. MRI is more useful for diseases of the inner ear. Disease processes in the pontine angle and \\nin the internal acoustic meatus are not discussed.\\nNormal variants:\\nIllustration of a cholesteatoma There are several normal variants which may simulate disease or should be reported because they can endanger the surgical approach. Variants which ma\\ny simulate disease: Variants which may pose a danger during surgery: On the left an illustration of a cholesteatoma. This will be discussed later. Bilateral cochlear cleft presents \\nas a line-like lucency lateral to the cochlear apex. (arrows)\\nCochlear cleft:\\nA cochlear cleft is a narrow curved lucency extending from the cochlea towards the promontory. It is often visible in infants and children but can also be seen in adults. It can be \\nmistaken for a fracture line or an otosclerotic focus. On the left an example of bilateral cochlear cleft in a one-year old boy with congenital hearing loss. Petromastoid canal\\nPetromastoid canal:\\nThe petromastoid canal or subarcuate canal connects the mastoid antrum with the cranial cavity and houses the subarcuate artery and vein. Its diameter is around 0.5 mm. It can be co\\nnfused with a fracture line. On the left a 40-year old female with a sclerotic mastoid. The petromastoid canal is easily seen. (arrow) Petromastoid canal On the left a well-pneumati\\nzed mastoid. The petromastoid canal is difficult to discern (arrow). Petromastoid canal On the left another patient with a sclerotic mastoid. The petromastoid canal is well seen. If\\n this patient would be a trauma victim, the canal could easily be confused with a fracture line (arrow). Cochlear aqueduct\\nCochlear aqueduct:\\nThe cochlear aqueduct connects the perilymph with the subarachoid space. The cochlear aqueduct is a narrow canal which runs towards the cochlea in almost the same direction as the i\\nnner auditory canal, but situated more caudally. It is a point where infected cerebrospinal fluid can enter the inner ear. This can happen in patients with meningitis and cause laby\\nrinthitis ossificans. On the left a 58-year old male. The blue arrow indicates the cochlear aqueduct coursing towards the cochlea. This could be mistaken for a fracture line (arrow)\\n. Note there is also opacification of the tympanic cavity and mastoid air cells. High jugular bulb: axial and coronal image\\nHigh jugular bulb:\\nOn the left axial and coronal images of a 64-year old male. The jugular bulb rises above the lower limb of the posterior semicircular canal (arrows). The jugular bulb is often asymm\\netric, with the right jugular bulb usually being larger than the left. If it reaches above the posterior semicircular canal it is called a high jugular bulb. If the bony separation \\nbetween the jugular bulb and the tympanic cavity is absent, it is termed a dehiscent jugular bulb. Rarely an outpouching is seen – this is known as a jugular bulb diverticulum. Jugu\\nlar bulb diverticulum: axial and coronal image\\nJugular bulb diverticulum:\\nOn the left axial and coronal images of a 50-year old male. Incidental finding of a jugular bulb diverticulum (arrows). Bulging sigmoid sinus\\nBulging sigmoid sinus:\\nThe sigmoid sinus can protrude into the posterior mastoid. It can be accidentally lacerated during a mastoidectomy and therefore should be mentioned in the radiological report when \\npresent. On the left an axial image of a 43-year old male, post-mastoidectomy. The sigmoid sinus bulges anteriorly\\nCongenital anomalies:\\nLarge vestibular aqueduct bilaterally (black arrows). The bony modiolus is not visible (white arrow).\\nLarge vestibular aqueduct:\\nThe vestibular aqueduct is a narrow bony canal (aqueduct) that connects the endolymphatic sac with the inner ear (vestibule). Running through this bony canal is a tube called the en\\ndolymphatic duct. A large vestibular aqueduct is associated with progressive sensorineural hearing loss. This progression is reportedly associated with minor head trauma, which expo\\nses the inner ear to pressure waves via the large vestibular aqueduct. The large vestibular aqueduct is associated with an absence of the bony modiolus in more than 90% of patients.\\n On the left a patient with a bilateral large vestibular aqueduct. Notice that the bony modiolus is not visible. On the left a 5-year old boy with bilateral progressive hearing loss\\n. A large vestibular aqueduct is seen (black arrow). The cochlea has no bony modiolus. (white arrow). External auditory canal atresia\\nExternal auditory canal atresia:\\nIn external ear atresia the external auditory canal is not developed and sound cannot reach the tympanic membrane. A conductive hearing loss is the result. It is important to note w\\nhether the atretic plate is composed of soft tissue or bone. The extent of ossicular chain malformation can vary from a fusion of the mallear head and incudal body to a small clump \\nof malformed ossicles, which is often fused to the wall of the tympanic cavity. The mastoid portion of the facial nerve canal can be located more anteriorly than normal and this is \\nimportant to report to the ENT surgeon in order to avoid iatrogenic injury to the nerve during surgery. On the left a 2-year old boy with bilateral bony external auditory canal atre\\nsia. The malleus and incus are fused (arrow). The cochlea is normal. Minor cochlear deformity\\nCochlear deformities:\\nThe cochlea develops between 3 and 10 weeks of gestation. Early developmental arrest leads to an inner ear that consists of a small cyst, the so-called Michel deformity. Development\\nal arrest at a later stage leads to more or less severe deformities of the cochlea and of the vestibular apparatus. An incomplete partition of the cochlea is called a Mondini malfor\\nmation Instead of the normal two-and-one-half turns, there is only a normal basal turn and a cystic apex. On the left a 2-year old girl. The images are of a CT-examination is done p\\nrior to cochlear implantation. A minor deformity of the cochlear apex is visible – there is no separation of the second and third turn and the bony modiolus is absent. The vestibula\\nr aqueduct is normal. Malformed lateral semicircular canal\\nLateral semicircular canal malformation:\\nMalformations of the vestibule and semicircular canals vary from a common cavity to all these structures to a hypoplastic lateral semicircular canal. During embryogenesis the latera\\nl semicircular canal is the last structure to form, thus in malformations of the semicircular canals the lateral canal is most commonly affected. On the left a 10-year old boy, sche\\nduled for cochlear implantation. There is a widening and shortening of the lateral semicircular canal. The vestibule is relatively large (arrow). Malformed lateral and superior semi\\ncircular canal On the left a 16-year old boy, examined preoperatively for a cholesteatoma of the right ear. As a coincidental finding, there is a plump lateral semicircular canal (y\\nellow arrow) and an absence of the superior canal (blue arrow). In the expected position of the superior canal only a bump is seen. The posterior canal is normal.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 212}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Chronic otitis media:\\nNormal pneumatization (left) and a completely sclerotic mastoid (right) For the ENT-surgeon the differentiation between chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma is important. Both dis\\neases often occur in poorly pneumatized mastoids. An important finding which can help differentiate the two conditions is bony erosion. Erosion of the lateral wall of the epitympanu\\nm and of the ossicular chain is common in cholesteatoma (around 75%). Erosion can occur in chronic otitis, but reportedly in less than 10% of patients. Displacement of the ossicular\\n chain can be seen in cholesteatoma, not in chronic otitis. Cholesteatoma can present with a non-dependent mass while chronic otitis shows thickened mucosal lining. However, in both\\n diseases the middle ear cavity can be completely opacified, obscuring a cholesteatoma. On the far left a 54-year old male with a normally pneumatized mastoid with aerated cells. Ne\\nxt to it a 69-year old female. The mastoid is completely sclerotic - no air cells are present. Chronic otitis media On the left a 14-year old boy. The eardrum is thickened. A small \\namount of soft tissue (arrow) is visible between the scutum and the ossicular chain but no erosion is present. This favors the diagnosis of chronic otitis media. Tympanosclerosis On\\n the left an 11-year old girl with bilateral ear infections. There is calcification of the eardrum (white arrow) and calcific deposits on the stapes and the tendon of the stapedius \\nmuscle (black arrow). Chronic otitis media On the left a 37-year old female who was admitted with a peritonsillar abscess. She\\nalso suffered from chronic otitis media.

Chronic otitis media On the left a coronal reconstruction of the same patient. CT shows the tympanostomy tube (y\\nellow arrow) and complete opacification of the tympanic cavity and mastoid air cells with soft tissue.\\nCholesteatoma:\\nCholesteatoma: 20-year old woman with recurrent otitis. Granulations on left ear drum. Soft tissue mass between ossicular chain and lateral tympanic wall, which is eroded. Right sid\\ne for comparison. Cholesteatoma is believed to arise in retraction pockets of the eardrum. It gradually enlarges over time due to exfoliation and encapsulation of the tissue. Most c\\nholesteatomas are acquired, but some are congenital. The ENT surgeon often states that cholesteatoma is a clinical diagnosis.\\nScraps of cholesteatoma are visible in the external auditory canal. On CT a small cholesteatoma presents as a soft tissue mass. In more extensive disease erosions may be present. La\\nrge cholesteatomas can erode the auditory ossicles and the walls of the antrum and extend into the middle cranial fossa. The most affected structures are: On the left a 20-year old \\nwoman with recurrent otitis. There were granulations on the left ear drum. CT demonstrates a soft tissue mass between the ossicular chain and the lateral tympanic wall, which is ero\\nded. this favors the diagnosis of cholesteatoma. 20-year old woman with recurrent otitis.

The body of the incus, which is lateral to the mallear head is also eroded (arrow). CT signs of cholesteatoma are: Erosion of the facial nerve canal is diffic\\nult to distinguish\\nbecause the wall is often so thin that it is not visible at CT. Cholesteatoma On the left a 50-year old male with hearing loss on the left side. There is a soft tissue mass with ero\\nsion of the long process of the incus. This location is typical of a pars tensa cholesteatoma.

The examination shows a mass with mixed intensity on sagittal T1 and high intensity on transverse T2 weighted images. It has a high in\\ntensity on diffusion weighted images, which indicates restricted diffusion. (arrows) Cholesteatomas are of mixed intensity on T1-weighted pulse sequences and of high intensity on T2\\n-weighted pulse sequences. MRI is particularly useful for evaluating the extension of a cholesteatoma into the middle and/or posterior fossa, and for demonstrating possible herniati\\non of intracranial contents into the temporal bone - especially after surgery. After intravenous contrast MRI can distinguish granulation tissue from effusions. Diffusion weighted M\\nR can differentiate between a cholesteatoma, which has a restricted diffusion, and other abnormalities - especially granulation tissue - which have normal diffusion characteristics \\n(figure).\\nOtosclerosis:\\nOtosclerosis anteriorly to the oval window (arrow) Otosclerosis is a genetically mediated metabolic bone disease of unknown etiology. It is sometimes called otospongiosis because th\\ne disease begins with an otospongiotic phase, which is followed by an otosclerotic phase when osteoclasts are replaced by osteoblasts and dense sclerotic bone is deposited in areas \\nof previous bone resorption. When this process involves the oval window in the region of the footplate, the footplate becomes fixed, resulting in conductive hearing loss. Conductive\\n hearing loss develops early in the third decade and is considered to be the hallmark of the disease. However, involvement of other portions of the otic capsule can result in mixed \\nsensorineural hearing loss. The process starts in the region of the oval window, classically at the fissula ante fenestram, i.e. in front of the oval window (fenestral otosclerosis)\\n. It can also occur around the cochlea (retrofenestral otosclerosis). On the left a transverse CT-image of a 23-year old female with conductive hearing loss. There is a subtle otosc\\nlerotic focus in the characteristic site: the fissula ante fenestram (arrows). Otosclerosis On CT the detection of otosclerosis can be difficult to the inexperienced eye because the\\n spread of the disease is often symmetrical. A small lucency at the fissula ante fenestram is typical for otosclerosis. In more severe cases lucencies are also present around the co\\nchlea. Sometimes the whole otic capsule is surrounded by these 'otospongiotic' foci, forming the so-called fourth ring of Valvassori. In a minority of patients the disease is unilat\\neral. This is virtually always limited to a lucency at the fissula ante fenestram. On the left a 49-year old male with left sided conductive hearing loss.

Three years ago she was diagnosed with total hearing loss o\\nf the right ear. The image shows a subluxation of the incudomallear joint (arrow). Left ear for comparison. Fractures of the temporal bone are associated with head injuries. The con\\nsequences of the intracranial injuries dominate in the early period after the trauma. A temporal bone fracture can manifest itself with acute signs like bleeding from the ear or acu\\nte facial paralysis. Hearing loss is of course not a life-threatening event. Temporal bone fractures can be classified as longitudinal or transverse. Longitudinal fractures generall\\ny spare the inner ear, which is more often breached by transverse fractures. However, many temporal bone fractures are neither longitudinal nor transverse and a comprehensive descri\\nption of the structures which are crossed by the fracture is needed. Sensorineural hearing loss due to longitudinal fracture (arrows) On the left images of a woman who had fallen do\\nwn from the stairs three days earlier. She suffered from severe sensorineural hearing loss on the left side. A longitudinal fracture is visible, which courses anteriorly to the coch\\nlea through the region of the geniculate ganglion (arrows). There were no signs of facial nerve paralysis. No fracture line could be seen across the inner ear. Opacification of the \\nmiddle ear, likely as a result of a hematotympanum. Right ear for comparison. Posttraumatic conductive hearing loss can be caused by a hematotympanum or a tear of the tympanic membr\\nane. In these cases the hearing loss usually resolves spontaneously. In persistent conductive hearing loss there is usually a disruption of the ossicular chain. The most common disr\\nuption is a dislocation of the incudostapedial joint which is often a subtle finding. Disruptions can occur at the incudomallear joint. Fractures of the long process of the incus or\\n the crura of the stapes are difficult to diagnose. Fractures of the inner ear are seen in posttraumatic sensorineural hearing loss. Careful inspection is required in order to pick \\nout these thin fracture lines. Cochlear concussion with blood in the cochlea can be visualized with MRI.

Transverse fracture through vestibule and facial nerve canal (arrows) On the left images of a 54-year old male several years after head trauma, followed by le\\nft-sided hearing loss.\\nThere is a transverse fracture through the vestibule and facial nerve canal (arrows).\\nThe lateral semicircular canal is partially filled with dense material, compatible with labyrinthitis ossificans. Facial nerve paralysis can be acute or delayed. In acute posttrauma\\ntic paralysis a fracture line through the facial nerve canal - usually in the tympanic part - can be observed, sometimes with a bony fragment impinging on the canal. In delayed faci\\nal paralysis the nerve is probably edematous and fracture lines can be absent. On the other hand, a fracture line may be seen to cross the facial nerve canal without any associated \\nnerve dysfunction. Several normal structures may be mistaken for fractures:\\nVascular anomalies:\\nA vascular anomaly can be suspected if the patient complains of pulsatile tinnitus or when there is a reddish or bluish mass behind the eardrum. Vascular anomalies are: Non-vascular\\n anomalies which can also manifest as a retrotympanic mass: Aberrant internal carotid artery (courtesy of Hervé Tanghe)\\nAberrant internal carotid artery:\\nIn patients with an aberrant internal carotid artery the cervical part of the internal carotid artery is absent.

The bone can be perme\\nated by tumor. The glomus tympanicum tumor is typically a small soft tissue mass on the promontory. Large tumors have a 'salt and pepper' appearance at MRI due to their rich vascula\\nrity with flow voids. They enhance strongly after i.v. contrast.

On the left angiographic\\nimages of the left external carotid artery before embolisation and the common\\ncarotid artery after embolization (blue arrow). Only a faint blush remains. Glomus tumors arise from paraganglion cells which are present in the jugular foramen and on the promontor\\ny of the cochlea around the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Elderly persons are most commonly affected with a female predominance. The presenting symptoms are conduct\\nive hearing loss, tinnitus, and pain. At otoscopy a blue ear drum is seen. Glomus tumors of the jugular foramen (also called glomus jugulotympanicum tumors) are more common than tum\\nors which are confined to the middle ear (glomus tympanicum tumor) EndoLymphatic Sac Tumor: destructive process of the dorsal temporal bone, with some calcification (arrow).

In this article we will discuss the ultrasound examination technique \\naccording to Graf.\\nIntroduction:\\nDevelopmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common musculoskeletal problems in newborns. It is also known as congenital hip dysplasia, but actually this is a misnome\\nr. It is a developmental disease. There are children who are born with normal hips who develop dysplasia (figure). In this case the child had a neuromuscular disorder which caused t\\nhe hip to become dysplastic and dislocate. On the other hand there are children who are born with dysplasia of the hip that resolves spontaneously or after relatively simple treatme\\nnt, e.g. a Pavlik harness (figure). So we have to realize that DDH is a dynamic disease and it is not always present at birth as suggested by the name congenital hip dysplasia. Trea\\ntment is easier and complications are less likely to occur when DDH is diagnosed early. In this case at 13 months the only sign of the former dysplasia is the delay of the femoral h\\nead to ossify. Developmental dysplasia of the hip is more common in girls especially if there has been a breech presentation or when they have a positive family history. These risk \\nfactors play a lesser role in boys. Clubfoot was thought to be a risk factor, but this no longer holds true.\\nUltrasound orientation:\\nWith ultrasound we are looking at the same anatomic structures as on the x-ray. The ultrasound images are in the coronal plane (figure). As a consequence the Graf classification of \\nhip dysplasia is mainly based on the morphology of the iliac bone, where we look at the shape of the acetabulum, the bony and cartilaginous acetabular rim, labrum and position of th\\ne femoral head. Since ultrasound has the advantage of also displaying the cartilagenous structures, we can also look at the coverage of the femoral head by the cartilage of the acet\\nabulum and the labrum. Because the infant is lying on its side the anatomy is displayed in a horizontal fashion instead of vertical (figure) And this is the way the ultrasound image\\n is displayed on the screen of the ultrasound machine Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. In this video the ultrasound anatomy is shown. Here the anatomy in the cor\\nonal plane.\\nExamination technique:\\nA lineair, high frequency probe is used. The focus is set at the acetabular edge. It is important to display an image in the coronal plane at the level of the triradiate cartilage, \\nwhich is the synchondrosis between the iliac, ischial and pubic bones which form the acetabulum. This is shown in the video. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\\nInstability:\\nSometimes in very displastic hips the use of a convex transducer can be of help.\\nMeasurements:\\nFirst three points of interest need to be indentified in the image: Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. In this video you'll see proper measurement after placement \\nof the three points of interest. When you perform the ultrasound examination, make sure that these three points can be identified on the image.\\nGraf's classification:\\nThis is the Graf classification - short version. The alpha-angle, which is a measurement of the bony roof of the acetabulum, mainly determines the hip type. Actually, for classifica\\ntion purposes the beta angle is only used to differentiate between type Ia and Ib (both normal hips) and between type IIc and type D) This is the Graf classification - long version.\\n Another important factor is the age of the child. Up to the age of 3 months (13 weeks) an alpha angle below 60 degrees is acceptable. A neonate can even start with an alpha angle o\\nf 50 degrees provided that the angle gradually reaches the 60 degrees by the age of 12 weeks. At the age of 3 months the decision has to be made whether the hip is normal or not. Ev\\nidently if a neonate starts with an alpha angle of 60 degrees than everything is o.k. and no follow up is necessary.\\nType I:\\nType I hips have an alpha angle of more than 60 degrees and are normal. Although there is a distinction between type Ia and Ib this is not clinically relevant. Type Ia This examinat\\nion shows a good morphology of the bony acetabular roof with a sharp angular bony rim. No problem here in depicting the lateral rim of the bony roof of the acetabulum. There is nice\\n coverage of the femoral head by the cartilaginous roof and the labrum. The alpha angle is above the 60 degrees and the beta-angle is way below 55 degrees. Type Ib This is also a no\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 216}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"rmal hip. There is good coverage of the femoral head. The only difference with the type Ia-hip is a blunted bony rim. As a result the alpha-angle will be a little bit steeper than i\\nn type Ia, but still within a normal range. The beta angle is 61º, i.e more than 55º. These hips are normal and follow up is not needed.\\nType II:\\nType IIaIf a child is less than 3 months old, then an alpha angle of 50-59 degrees is considered an immature hip. At the age of 6-13 weeks a distinction is made whether it is though\\nt that the immature hip develops apropriate according to age (IIa+) or inappropriate (IIa-) Type IIa+ The maturation process of type IIa+ hip is still within acceptable limits for a\\nge according to the table. Type IIa-A type IIa- hip is at risk to develop dysplasia. So an alpha angle of 56 degrees at the age of 7 weeks is called type IIa+, while at the age of 1\\n0 weeks it is called a type IIa-. Type IIb If a child is older than 3 months or 13 weeks, then an alpha angle of 50-59 degrees is considered a sign of dysplasia, i.e type IIb. Type \\nIIa Here we see a hip with an alpha-angle of 55º. The bony acetabular roof is less well-formed and there is a rounded acetabular bony rim. The age of the child is 4 weeks, so we cal\\nl this a type IIa. About 90 % of newborns with Graf type IIa hips do not develop DDH. Type IIa(+) At the age of 6 weeks the same findings result in a type IIa(+). Type IIb At the ag\\ne of 3 months or 13 weeks the same findings result in a type IIb-hip. Type IIc Here a type IIc hip. The bony acetabular roof is severely deficient with a rounded to almost flat bony\\n rim. The alpha angle is 46 degrees. The femoral head is still covered by the cartilaginous roof and the labrum.\\nType D:\\nA type D hip is much like a type IIC hip, but the main difference is a decentring hip with a displaced cartilage roof.\\nType III:\\nIn type III hips the femoral head dislocated. The labrum is moved upwards.\\nType IV:\\nIn Graf type IV there is a severe dislocation of the femoral head which obscures most of the bony roof. The cartilaginous roof is compressed between the femoral head and the bony ac\\netabular rim. The labrum is dislocated downwards and interposed between the femoral head and the lateral acetabular edge.\\nReporting:\\nIn the table a list of things that should be mentioned in your report. by Graf R.

              " Document(page_content='In the BI-RADS edition 2003 the assignment of the breast composition was based on the overall density resulting in ACR catergory 1 ( <25% fibroglandular tissue), category 2 ( 25-50%\\n), category 3 (50-75%) and category 4 (>75%). In BI-RADS 2013 the use of percentages is discouraged, because in individual cases it is more important to take into account the chance\\n that a mass can be obscured by fibroglandular tissue than the percentage of breast density as an indicator for breast cancer risk. In the BI-RADS edition 2013 the assignment of the\\n breast composition is changed into a, b, c and d-categories followed by a description: The term density describes the degree of x-ray attenuation of breast tissue but not discrete \\nmammographic findings.\\n* c- The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses. Some areas in the breasts are sufficiently dense to obscure small masses.\\n* d\\n- The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography. Notice in the left example the composition is c - heterogeneously dense, although the volume of fibro\\nglandular tissue is less than 50%. The fibroglandular tissue in the upper part is sufficiently dense to obscure small masses. So it is called c, because small masses can be obscured\\n. Historically this would have been called an ACR 2: 25-50% density. The example on the right has more than 50% glandular tissue and is also called composition c.\\nMass:\\nA \\'Mass\\' is a space occupying 3D lesion seen in two different projections. If a potential mass is seen in only a single projection it should be called a \\'asymmetry\\' until its three-\\ndimensionality is confirmed. The images show a fat-containing lesion with a popcorn-like calcification. All fat-containing lesions are typically benign. These image-findings are dia\\ngnostic for a hamartoma - also known as fibroadenolipoma. The shape of a mass is either round, oval or irregular. Always make sure that a mass that is found on physical examination \\nis the same as the mass that is found with mammography or ultrasound. Location and size should be applied in any lesion, that must undergo biopsy. The margin of a lesion can be: Thi\\ns is a benign finding.\\n* Obscured or partially obscured, when the margin is hidden by superimposed fibroglandular tissue. Ultrasound can be helpful to define the margin better.\\n* Microlobulated. This implies a suspicious finding.\\n* Indistinct (historically ill-defined). This is also a suspicious finding.\\n* Spiculated with radiating lines from the mass is a very suspicious finding. The density of a mass is related to the expected attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular tissu\\ne. High density is associated with malignancy. It is extremely rare for breast cancer to be low density. Here multiple round circumscribed low density masses in the right breast. Th\\nese were the result of lipofilling, which is transplantation of body fat to the breast. Here a hyperdense mass with an irregular shape and a spiculated margin. Notice the focal skin\\n retraction. This was reported as BI-RADS 5 and proved to be an invasive ductal carcinoma.\\nArchitectural distortion:\\nThe term architectural distortion is used, when the normal architecture is distorted with no definite mass visible. This includes thin straight lines or spiculations radiating from \\na point, and focal retraction, distortion or straightening at the edges of the parenchyma. The differential diagnosis is scar tissue or carcinoma. Architectural distortion can also \\nbe seen as an associated feature. For instance if there is a mass that causes architectural distortion, the likelihood of malignancy is greater than in the case of a mass without di\\nstortion. Notice the distortion of the normal breast architecture on oblique view (yellow circle) and magnification view. A resection was performed and only scar tissue was found in\\n the specimen.\\nAsymmetries:\\nFindings that represent unilateral deposits of fibroglandulair tissue not conforming to the definition of a mass. This has to be differentiated from a mass.\\n* Global asymmetry consisting of an asymmetry over at least one quarter of the breast and is usually a normal variant.\\n* Developing asymmetry new, larger and more conspicuous than on a previous examination. Here an example of a focal asymmetry seen on MLO and CC-view. Local compression views and ult\\nrasound did not show any mass. Here an example of global asymmetry. In this patient this is not a normal variant, since there are associated features, that indicate the possibility \\nof malignancy like skin thickening, thickened septa and subtle nipple retraction. Ultrasound (not shown) detected multiple small masses that proved to be adenocarcinoma. The PET-CT \\nshows diffuse infiltrating carcinoma. Asymmetry versus Mass All types of asymmmetry have different border contours than true masses and also lack the conspicuity of masses. Asymmetr\\nies appear similar to other discrete areas of fibroglandulair tissue except that they are unitaleral, with no mirror-image correlate in the opposite breast. An asymmetry demonstrate\\ns concave outward borders and usually is interspersed with fat, whereas a mass demonstrates convex outward borders and appears denser in the center than at the periphery. The use of\\n the term \"density\" is confusing, as the term \"density\" should only be used to describe the x-ray attenuation of a mass compared to an equal volume of fibroglandular tissue.\\nCalcifications:\\nIn the 2003 atlas calcifications were classified by morphology and distribution either as benign, intermediate concern or high probability of malignancy. In the 2013 version the app\\nroach has changed. Since calcifications of intermediate concern and of high probability of malignancy all are being treated the same way, which usually means biopsy, it is logic to \\ngroup them together. Calcifications are now either typically benign or of suspicious morphology. Within this last group the chances of malignancy are different depending on their mo\\nrphology (BI-RADS 4B or 4C) and also depending on their distribution. Typically benign Skin, vascular, coarse, large rodlike, round or punctate (< 1mm), rim, dystrophic, milk of cal\\ncium and suture calcifications are typically benign. There is one exception of the rule: an isolated group of punctuate calcifications that is new, increasing, linear, or segmental \\nin distribution, or adjacent to a known cancer can be assigned as probably benign or suspicious. Amorphous, indistinct microcalcifications Suspicious morphology Usually more conspic\\nuous than amorphous forms and are seen to have discrete shapes, without fine linear and linear branching forms, usually < 0,5 mm.\\n* Fine linear or fine-linear branching (BI-RADS 4C) Thin, linear irregular calcifications, may be discontinuous, occasionally branching forms can be seen, usually < 0,5 mm. Read mor\\ne on breast calcifications. Distribution of calcifications The arrangement of calcifications, the distribution, is at least as important as morphology. These descriptors are arrange\\nd according to the risk of malignancy: The 2013 edition refines the upper limit in size for grouped distribution as 2 cm (historically 1 cm) while retaining > 2 cm as the lower limi\\nt for regional distribution. Study the images and describe the calcifications. Then continue reading. The findings are: This proved to be multifocal DCIS with areas of invasive carc\\ninoma.\\nAssociated features:\\nAssociated features are things that are seen in association with suspicious findings like masses, asymmetries and calcifications. Associated features play a role in the final assess\\nment. For instance a BI-RADS 4-mass could get a BI-RADS 5 assessment if seen in association with skin retraction.\\nSpecial cases:\\nSpecial cases are findings with features so typical that you do not need to describe them in detail, like for instance an intramammary lymph node or a wart on the skin.\\nUltrasound - Breast Imaging Lexicon:\\nMany descriptors for ultrasound are the same as for mammography. For instance when we describe the shape or margin of a mass. Here we will focus on findings that are specific for ul\\ntrasound: Breast Composition: Mass: Echogenicity can contribute to the assessment of a lesion, together with other feature categories.

Posterior features represent the attenuation characteristics of a mass with respect to its acoustic transmission, also of additional va\\nlue. Alone it has little specificity. Calcifications: Associated features: Special cases - cases with a unique diagnosis or pathognomonic ultrasound appearance:\\nFinal Assessment Categories:\\nBI-RADS 0:\\nNeed Additional Imaging Evaluation and/or Prior Mammograms For Comparison: Category 0 or BI-RADS 0 is utilized when further imaging evaluation (e.g. additional views or ultrasound) \\nor retrieval of prior examinations is required. When additional imaging studies are completed, a final assessment is made. Always try to avoid this category by immediately doing add\\nitional imaging or retrieving old films before reporting. Even better to have the old examinations before starting the examination. This patient presented with a mass on the mammogr\\nam at screening, which was assigned as BI-RADS 0 (needs additional imaging evaluation). Additional ultrasound demonstrated that the mass was caused by an intramammary lymph node. Th\\ne final assessment is BI-RADS 2 (benign finding). Don\\'t forget to mention in the report that the lymph node on US corresponds with the noncalcified mass on mammography. In the parag\\nraph on location we will discuss how we can be sure that the lymph node that we found with ultrasound is indeed the same as the mammographic mass. DO DON\\'T\\nBI-RADS 1:\\nNegative: There is nothing to comment on. The breasts are symmetric and no masses, architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications are present. BI-RADS 1 (normal). There is no\\nthing to comment on. BI-RADS 1 DO\\nBI-RADS 2:\\nBenign Finding: Like BI-RADS 1, this is a normal assessment, but here, the interpreter chooses to describe a benign finding in the mammography report, like: BI-RADS Category 2: Mass\\n seen on mammogram proved to be a cyst. BI-RADS 2 DO DON\\'T\\nBI-RADS 3:\\n**Probably Benign Finding Initial Short-Interval Follow-Up Suggested:** A finding placed in this category should have less than a 2% risk of malignancy. It is not expected to change\\n over the follow-up interval, but the radiologist would prefer to establish its stability. Lesions appropriately placed in this category include: Here a non-palpable sharply defined\\n mass with a group of punctate calcifications. The mass was categorized as BI-RADS 3. Continue with follow up images. Final assessment was changed to a Category 2 Follow-up at 6, 12\\n and 24 months showed no change and the final assessment was changed into a Category 2. Nevertheless the patient and the clinician preferred removal, because the radiologist was not\\n able to present a clear differential diagnosis. So add the following sentence in your report: PA: benign vascular malformation. If a BI-RADS 3 lesion shows any change during follow\\n up, it will change into a BI-RADS 4 or 5 and biopsy should be performed. The upper image shows a few amorphous calcifications initially classified as BI-RADS 3. At 12 month follow \\nup more than five calcifications were noted in a group. The findings were now classified as BI-RADS 4. This proved to be DCIS with invasive carcinoma. BI-RADS 3 DO Use in findings o\\nn mammography like Noncalcified circumscribed solid mass Focal asymmetry Solitary group of punctuate calcifications Use in findings on US with robust evidence to suggest Typical fib\\nroadenoma Isolated complicated cyst Clustered microcysts DON\\'T\\nBI-RADS 4:\\nSuspicious Abnormality - Biopsy Should Be Considered: This category is reserved for findings that do not have the classic appearance of malignancy but are sufficiently suspicious to\\n justify a recommendation for biopsy. BI-RADS 4 has a wide range of probability of malignancy (2 - 95%). By subdividing Category 4 into 4A, 4B and 4C , it is encouraged that relevan\\nt probabilities for malignancy be indicated within this category so the patient and her physician can make an informed decision on the ultimate course of action. DO Do use Category \\n4a in findings as: Partially circumscribed mass, suggestive of (atypical) fibroadenoma Palpable, solitary, complex cystic and solid cyst Probable abscess Do use Category 4b in findi\\nngs as: Group amorphous or fine pleomorphic calcifications Nondescript solid mass with indistinct margins Do use Category 4c in findings as: New group of fine linear calcifications \\nNew indistinct, irregular solitary mass The CC mammographic image shows a finding, not reproducible on the MLO view. This finding is sufficiently suspicious to justify biopsy. A ben\\nign lesion, although unlikely, is a possibility. This could be for instance ectopic glandular tissue within a heterogeneously dense breast. This lesion is categorized as BI-RADS 4. \\nHere another BI-RADS 4 abnormality. The pathologist could report to you that it is sclerosing adenosis or ductal carcinoma in situ. Both diagnoses are concordant with the mammograph\\nic findings.\\nBI-RADS 5:\\n**Highly Suggestive of Malignancy. Appropriate Action Should Be Taken:** BI-RADS 5 must be reserved for findings that are classic breast cancers, with a >95% likelihood of malignanc\\ny. The current rationale for using category 5 is that if the percutaneous tissue diagnosis is nonmalignant, this automatically should be considered as discordant. First study the im\\nages and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are: This mass is categorized as BI-RADS 5. High density mass with spiculated margin BI-RADS 5 DO Then add senten\\nce: \"Biopsy should be performed in the absence of clinical contraindications\". DON\\'T Then use Category 4c.\\nBI-RADS 6:\\nDO DON\\'T On the left BI-RADS 5 lesion. On the right after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy BI-RADS 6. Here images of a biopsy proven malignancy. On the initial mammogram a marker is placed\\n in the palpable tumor. Due to the dense fibroglandular tissue the tumor is not well seen. Ultrasound demonstrated a 37 mm mass with indistinct and angular margins and shadowing. Af\\nter chemotherapy the tumor is not visible on the mammogram. Ultrasound showed shrinkage of the tumor to a 18 mm mass, which was categorized as BI-RADS 6.\\nLocation in Mammography and US:\\nA mass is seen in the outer lower quadrant of the left breast at 4 o\\' clock in the posterior portion of the breast at 4cm distance from the nipple. A complete set of location descri\\nptors consists of: There may be variability within breast imaging practices, members of a group practice should agree upon a consistent policy for documenting. When you use more mod\\nalities, always make sure, that you are dealing with the same lesion. For instance a lesion found with US does not have to be the same as the mammographic or physical finding. Somet\\nimes repeated mammographic imaging with markers on the lesion found with US can be helpful. Cysts can be aspirated or filled with air after aspiration to make sure that the lesion f\\nound on the mammogram is caused by a cyst. Solid lesions can be injected with contrast or a marker can be placed in difficult cases. Here images that you\\'ve seen before. They are of\\n a patient with a new lesion found at screening. With ultrasound an intramammary lymph node was found, but we weren\\'t sure whether this was the same as the mass on the mammogram. Co\\nntinue with the mammographic images after contrast injection. Contrast was injected into the node and a repeated mammogram was performed. Here we have proof that the mass is caused \\nby an intramammary lymph node, since the mammographic mass contains the contrast. This patient presented with a tumor in the left breast. However in the right breast a group of amor\\nphous and fine pleomorphic calcifications was seen. Ultrasound examination was performed Ultrasound of the region demonstrated an irregular mass, which proved to be an adenocarcinom\\na with fine needle aspiration (FNA). To find out whether the mass was within the area of the calcifications, contrast was injected into the mass. The mass is evidently in another re\\ngion of the breast. Now a vacuum assisted biopsy has to be performed of the calcifications, because maybe we are dealing with DCIS in one area and an invasive carcinoma in another a\\nrea.\\nSize measurement:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 219}),\n",

In this review a systemat\\nic approach for the analysis of a possible brain tumor is described.\\nIntroduction:\\nWhen we analyze a potential brain tumor, there are many questions that need to be answered. Since different tumors occur in different age groups we first of all need to know the age\\n of the patient. Next we need to know where the lesion is located - is it intra- or extra-axial and in what anatomical compartment does it lie? Is it located in the sellar or pontoc\\nerebellar region for example? Is it a solitary mass or is there multi-focal disease? On CT and MR we look for tissue characteristics like calcifications, fat, cystic components, con\\ntrast enhancement and signal intensity on T1WI, T2WI and DWI. Most brain tumors are of low signal intensity on T1WI and high on T2WI. Therefore high signal intensity on T1WI or low \\nsignal on T2WI can be an important clue to the diagnosis. Finally we have to consider the possibility that we are dealing with a lesion that simulates a tumor - like an abscess, MS-\\nplaque, vascular malformation, aneurysm or an infarct with luxury perfusion.\\nIncidence of CNS tumors:\\nRoughly one-third of CNS tumors are metastatic lesions, one third are gliomas and one-third is of non-glial origin. Glioma is a non-specific term indicating that the tumor originate\\ns from glial cells like astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal and choroid plexus cells. Astrocytoma is the most common glioma and can be subdivided into the low-grade pilocytic ty\\npe, the intermediate anaplastic type and the high grade\\nmalignant glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM is the most common type (50% of all astrocytomas). The non-glial cel tumors are a large heterogenous group of tumors of which meningioma\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 220}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' is the most common. Note: since the publication of this article, these numbers have changed and metastases now outnumber the primary brain tumors and are increasing in incidence as\\n overall cancer survival improves.\\nAge distribution:\\nThe age of the patient is an important factor for the differential diagnosis. Specific tumors occur under the age of 2, like choroid plexus papillomas, anaplastic astrocytomas and t\\neratomas. In the first decade medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, ependymomas, craniopharyngeomas and gliomas are most common, while metastases are very rare. When they do occur at this\\n age, metastases of a neuroblastoma are the most frequent. In adults about 50% of all CNS lesions are metastases. Other common tumors in adults are astrocytomas, glioblastoma multif\\norme, meningiomas, oligodendrogliomas, pituitary adenomas and schwannomas. Astrocytomas occur at any age, but glioblastoma multiforme is mostly seen in older people. Although cancer\\n is rare in children, brain tumors are the most common type of childhood cancer after leukemia and lymphoma. Most of the tumors in children are located infratentorially. The most co\\nmmon supra- and infratentorial tumors are listed in the table on the left. The most common tumors in adults are listed in the table on the left. Note that metastases are by far the \\nmost common. It is important to realize that 50% of metastases are solitary. Particularly in the posterior fossa, metastases should be in the top 3 of the differential diagnostic li\\nst. Hemangioblastoma is an uncommon tumor, but it is the most common primary intra-axial tumor in the adult. Supratentorially, metastases are also the most common tumors, followed b\\ny gliomas.\\nTumor spread:\\nIntra- versus Extraaxial:\\nWhen we study an intracranial mass, the first thing we want to know is whether the mass lies in- or outside of the brain. If it is outside the brain or extra-axial, then the lesion \\nis not actually a brain tumor, but derived from the lining of the brain or surrounding structures. Eighty percent of these extra-axial lesions will be either a meningioma or a schwa\\nnnoma. On the other hand, in an adult an intra-axial tumor will be a metastasis or astrocytoma in 75% of cases. Schwannoma in CPA-region with typical features of an extraaxial tumor\\n (T2WI) The T2W-images show a schwannoma located in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). This case nicely demonstrates the typical signs of an extra-axial tumor. There is a CSF cleft (\\nyellow arrow). The subarachnoid vessels that run on the surface of the brain are displaced by the lesion (blue arrow). There is gray matter between the lesion and the white matter (\\ncurved red arrow). The subarachnoid space is widened because growth of an extra-axial lesion tends to push away the brain. All these signs indicate that this is a typical extra-axia\\nl tumor. In the region of the CPA 90% of the extra-axial tumors are schwannomas. Coronal enhanced T1WI. Meningioma with dural tail, hyperostosis of adjacent bone and homogeneous enh\\nancement Another sign of an extra-axial origin is a broad dural base or a dural tail of enhancement as is typically seen in meningiomas. This may also occur in other extra-axial tum\\nors, but it is less common. Another sign of an extra-axial origin are bony changes. Bony changes are seen in bone tumors like chordomas, chondrosarcomas and metastases. They can als\\no be secondary, as is seen in meningiomas and other tumors. On the left an example of a meningioma with a broad dural base and a dural tail of enhancement. There is hyperostosis in \\nthe adjacent bone and the lesion enhances homogeneously. Extra-axial tumors are not derived from brain tissue and do not have a blood-brain-barrier, so most of them enhance homogene\\nously. Melanoma metastasis: T2WI and T1WI Intra- vs Extra-axial (2) The differentiation between intra-axial versus extra-axial is usually straight forward, but sometimes it can be v\\nery difficult and imaging in multiple planes may be necessary. The tumor in the case on the left was thought to be a falcine meningioma, i.e. extra-axial and was presented for surge\\nry. This lesion surely has the appearance of a meningioma: these tumors can be hypointense on T2 due to a fibrocollageneous matrix or calcifications and frequently produce reactive \\nedema in the adjacent white matter of the brain. However, there is gray matter on the anteromedial and posteromedial side of the lesion (red arrow). This indicates that the lesion i\\ns intra-axial. If the lesion was extra-axial the gray matter should have been pushed away. This proved to be a melanoma metastasis. Ependymoma with extension to the prepontine area \\n(blue arrows) and into the foramen magnum (red arrow). Local tumor spread (1) Astrocytomas spread along the white matter tracts and do not respect the bounderies of the lobes. Becau\\nse of this infiltrative growth, in many cases the tumor is actually larger than can be depicted with MR. Ependymomas of the fourth ventricle in children tend to extend through the f\\noramen of Magendie to the cisterna magna and through the lateral foramina of Luschka to the cerebellopontine angle (figure). Oligodendrogliomas typically show extension to the corte\\nx. Subarachnoid seeding Some tumors show subarachnoid seeding and form tumoral nodules along the brain and spinal cord. This is seen in PNET, ependymomas, GBMs, lymphomas, oligodend\\nrogliomas and choroid plexus papillomas. Primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET) form a rare group of tumors, which develop from primitive or undifferentiated nerve cells. These in\\nclude medulloblastomas and pineoblastomas. One of the most important roles of imaging is to assess the extent of a tumor. This is shown in the case on the left in a patient who pres\\nented with multiple cranial nerve abnormalities. On the images we see an extra-axial tumor in the region of the left cavernous sinus. There is homogeneous enhancement with a broad d\\nural tail. This is typical for a meningioma. Only by studying all the images we do appreciate that the actual extent of the tumor is greater than expected. The tumor is situated in \\nthe pterygopalatine fossa and extends into the orbit. It also spreads anteriorly into the middle cranial fossa Low grade astrocytoma Local tumor spread (2) Another important conside\\nration is the effect on the surrounding structures. Primary brain tumors are derived from brain cells and often have less mass effect for their size than you would expect, due to th\\neir infiltrative growth. This is not the case with metastases and extra-axial tumors like meningiomas or schwannomas, which have more mass effect due to their expansive growth. On t\\nhe left is an image of a diffusely infiltrating intra-axial tumor occupying most of the right hemisphere with only a minimal mass effect. This is typical for the infiltrative growth\\n seen in primary brain tumors. There is no enhancement so this would probably be a low-grade astrocytoma. Tumors and tumor-like masses that cross the midline\\nMidline crossing:\\nThe ability of tumors to cross the midline limits the differential diagnosis. LEFT: Metastases. RIGHT: Multiple meningiomas and a schwannoma in a patient with Neurofibromatosis II\\nMultifocal disease:\\nMultiple tumors in the brain usually indicate metastatic disease (figure). Primary brain tumors are typically seen in a single region, but some brain tumors like lymphomas, multicen\\ntric glioblastomas and gliomatosis cerebri can be multifocal. Some tumors can be multifocal as a result of seeding metastases: this can occur in medulloblastomas (PNET-MB), ependymo\\nmas, GBMs and oligodendrogliomas. Meningiomas and schwannomas can be multiple, especially in neurofibromatosis type II. Multiple brain tumors can be seen in phacomatoses: Many non-t\\numorous diseases like small vessel disease, infections (septic emboli, abscesses) or demyelinating diseases like MS can also present as multifocal disease.\\nCortical based tumors:\\nMost intra-axial tumors are located in the white matter. Some tumors, however, spread to or are located in the gray matter. The differential diagnosis for these cortical based tumor\\ns includes oligodendroglioma, ganglioglioma and Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithial Tumor (DNET). A DNET is a rare benign neoplasm, usually in a cortical and temporal location. Patients \\nwith a cortically based tumor usually present with complex seizures. On the left a 45-year-old female with a stable seizure disorder (complex-partial) for 15 years. There is a non-e\\nnhancing, cortically based tumor. This is a ganglioglioma. The differential diagnosis includes DNET and pilocytic astrocytoma. These cortically based tumors have to be differentiate\\nd from non-tumorous lesions like cerebritis, herpes simplex encephalitis, infarction and post-ictal changes. On the left are images of a 52-year-old female who, over the period of o\\nne year, complained of headache and neck pain. There is a recent onset of tonic-clonic seizures. The CT shows a mass with calcifications, which extends all the way to the cortex. Al\\nthough this is a large tumor there is only limited mass effect on surrounding structures, which indicates that this is an infiltrating tumor. The most likely diagnosis is oligodendr\\noglioma. The differential diagnosis includes a malignant astrocytoma or a glioblastoma.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 221}),\n",

This is typically seen in lym\\nphoma, colloid cyst and PNET-MB (medulloblastoma). Calcification Calcification is seen in many CNS tumors (Table). When we think of a calcified intra-axial tumor, we think oligodend\\nroglioma since these tumors nearly always have calcifications. However an intraaxial calcified tumor in the brain is more likely to be an astrocytoma than a oligodendrogliomas, sinc\\ne astrocytomas, although less frequently calcified, are far more common. A pineocytoma itself does not calcify, but instead it 'explodes' the calcifications of the pineal gland. On \\nthe left is an image of a calcified mass in the suprasellar region, causing obstructive hydrocephalus. This location in the suprasellar region and the calcification are typical for \\na craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngiomas are slow growing, extra-axial, squamous epithelial, calcified, cystic tumors arising from remnants of Rathke's cleft. They are located the (s\\nupra)sellar region and primarily seen in children with a small second peak incidence in older adults. Oligodendroglioma with calcification (PDWI and CT) On the left are images of a \\ntumor with a small calcification. . The calcification is not appreciated on the MR images, but is easily seen on CT. The calcification and the extension of the tumor to the cortex a\\nre very typical for an oligodendroglioma. An astrocytoma should be in the differential. Calcified meningioma On the left are images of a patient with progressive visual loss. On the\\n coronal and sagittal TW1I there is a large mass centered around the sella with a broad dural base. There is extension into the sella. This patient was booked for decompression. Onl\\ny after the CT was performed, was it appreciated how densely calcified this tumor is. It would be impossible to operate this tumor and preserve the patient's vision. Cystic versus S\\nolid There are many cystic lesions that can simulate a CNS tumor. These include epidermoid, dermoid, arachnoid, neuroenteric and neuroglial cysts. Even enlarged perivascular spaces \\nof Virchow Robin can simulate a tumor. In order to determine whether a lesion is a cyst or cystic mass look for the following characteristics: An arachnoid cyst is isointense to CSF\\n on all sequences. Tumor necrosis may sometimes look like a cyst, but it is never completely isointense to CSF. On the far left a craniopharyngioma with an enhancing rim surrounding\\n the cystic component. In the middle a neuroenteric cyst with the contents of which have the same signal intensity as CSF. On the right a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with a centra\\nl cystic component. The enhancement in GBM is usually more irregular.\\nHigh on T1:\\nMost tumors have a low or intermediate signal intensity on T1WI. Exceptions to this rule can indicate a specific type of tumor. On the left is a list of causes for T1-shortening. Ca\\nlcifications are mostly dark on T1WI, but depending on the matrix of the calcifications they can sometimes be bright on T1. Especially on gradient echo images slow flow can be seen \\nas bright signal on T1WI and should not be confused with enhancement. This is particularly pronounced on gradient echo images. If you only do an enhanced scan, remember that high si\\ngnal is not always enhancement. On the left are some images of tumors with high signal intensities on T1WI. On the far left images of a patient who presented with apoplexy. The high\\n signal is due to hemorrhage in a pituitary macroadenoma. The patient in the middle has a glioblastoma multiforme, which caused a hemorrhage in the splenium of the corpus callosum. \\nOn the right is a patient with a metastasis of a melanoma. The high signal intensity is due to the melanin content.\\nLow on T2:\\nMost tumors will be bright on T2WI due to a high water content. When tumors have a low water content they are very dense and hypercellular and the cells have a high nuclear-cytoplas\\nmasmic ratio. These tumors will be dark on T2WI. The classic examples are CNS lymphoma and PNET (also hyperdense on CT). Calcifications are mostly dark on T2WI. The differential dia\\ngnosis of calcified tumors was discussed above. Paramagnetic effects cause a signal drop and are seen in tumors that contain hemosiderin. Proteinaceous material can be dark on T2 de\\npending on the content of the protein itself. A classic example of this is the colloid cyst. Flow voids are also dark on T2 and indicate the presence of vessels or flow within a les\\nion. This is seen in tumors that contain a lot of vessels like hemangioblastomas, but also in non-tumorous lesions like vascular malformations. On the left some examples of tumors w\\nith a low signal intensity on T2WI. They can have a high SI on T2WI if they contain a lot of water. They can have a low SI on T2WI if they are very dense and hypercellular or when t\\nhey contain calcifications.\\nDiffusion weighted imaging:\\nNormally water protons have the ability to diffuse extracellularly and loose signal. High intensity on DWI indicates restriction of the ability of water protons to diffuse extracell\\nularly. Restricted diffusion is seen in abscesses, epidermoid cysts and acute infarction (due to cytotoxic edema). In cerebral abscesses the diffusion is probably restricted due to \\nthe viscosity of pus, resulting in a high signal on DWI. In most tumors there is no restricted diffusion - even in necrotic or cystic components. This results in a normal, low signa\\nl on DWI.\\nPerfusion Imaging:\\nPerfusion imaging can play an important role in determining the malignancy grade of a CNS tumor. Perfusion depends on the vascularity of a tumor and is not dependent on the breakdow\\nn of the blood-brain barrier. The amount of perfusion shows a better correlation with the grade of malignancy of a tumor than the amount of contrast enhancement.\\nEnhancement:\\nBlood brain barrier The brain has a unique triple layered blood-brain barrier (BBB) with tight endothelial junctions in order to maintain a consistent internal milieu. Contrast will\\n not leak into the brain unless this barrier is damaged. Enhancement is seen when a CNS tumor destroys the BBB. Extra-axial tumors such as meningiomas and schwannomas are not derive\\nd from brain cells and do not have a blood-brain barrier. Therefore they will enhance. There is also no blood-brain barrier in the pituitary, pineal and choroid plexus regions. Some\\n non-tumoral lesions enhance because they can also break down the BBB and may simulate a brain tumor. These lesions include like infections, demyelinating diseases (MS) and infarcti\\nons. Contrast enhancement cannot visualize the full extent of a tumor in cases of infiltrating tumors, like gliomas. The reason for this is that tumor cells blend with the normal br\\nain parenchyma where the blood brain barrier is still intact. Tumor cells can be found beyond the enhancing margins of the tumor and beyond any MR signal alteration - even beyond th\\ne area of edema. On the left is an image of a 42 y/o male with mild head trauma. On the T2WI there is a lesion in the left temporal lobe, found incidentally. There was no enhancemen\\nt and the DWI was normal. During follow-up there was a slight increase in size. This was diagnosed as a low-grade astrocytoma. It is not possible to resect such a lesion, since the \\ninfiltrating tumors cells are within the normal-appearing brain tissue. Low grade tumors with enhancement: ganglioglioma (left) and a pilocytic astrocytoma (right) In gliomas - like\\n astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and glioblastoma multiforme - enhancement usually indicates a higher degree of malignancy. Therefore when during the follow up of a low-grade gliom\\na the tumor starts to enhance, it is a sign of malignant transformation.. Gangliogliomas and pilocytic astrocytomas are the exceptions to this rule: they are low-grade tumors, but t\\nhey enhance vividly. As discussed above, it recently has been shown that tumor angiogenesis as shown by perfusion MR correlates better with tumor grade than enhancement after the ad\\nministration of intravenous contrast. LEFT: Schwannoma extending into the middle cranial fossa with homogeneous enhancement RIGHT: Primary Lymphoma known for its vivid enhancement T\\nhe amount of enhancement depends on the amount of contrast that is delivered to the interstitium. In general, the longer we wait, the better the interstitial enhancement will be. Th\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 222}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='e optimal timing is about 30 minutes and it is better to give contrast at the start of the examination and to do the enhanced T1WI at the end. Low grade astrocytoma. No enhancement.\\n No enhancement is seen in: On the left is an image of an intra-axial tumor in an adult. It is centered in the temporal lobe and involves the cortex. Although there is massive infil\\ntrative growth involving a large part of the right cerebral hemisphere, there is only minimal mass effect. There is no enhancement. These features are typical for a low-grade astroc\\nytoma. Homogeneous enhancement can be seen in: GBM with patchy enhancement and cystic component with ring enhancement Patchy enhancement can be seen in: On the left is an example of\\n a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The enhancement indicates that this is a high-grade tumor, but only parts of it enhance. Notice that there is also a cystic component with ring enh\\nancement. The tumor cells probably extend beyond the area of edema as seen on the FLAIR image. This is because gliomas grow infiltratively into normal brain - initially without any \\nMR changes. Patchy enhancement (2) On the left are images of a tumor located in the right hemisphere. Although is a large tumor, the mass-effect is limited. This indicates that ther\\ne is marked infiltrative growth, a characteristic typical for gliomas. Notice the heterogeneity on both T2WI and FLAIR. There is patchy enhancement. All these findings are typical f\\nor a GBM. Virtually no other tumor behaves in this way. Ring enhancement Ring enhancement is seen in metastases and high-grade gliomas. It is also seen in non-tumorous lesions like \\nabscesses, some MS-plaques and sometimes in an old hematomas. On the left three different ring enhancing lesions. Conspicuity of tumors with contrast The case on the left demonstrat\\nes the value of Gadolinium in the conspicuity of tumors. This is a patient with Neurofibromatosis II. After the administration of contrast the two meningiomas and the schwannoma are\\n easily seen. Leptomeningeal metastases Leptomeningeal metastases are usually not seen without the administration of intravenous contrast. The case on the left demonstrates the abno\\nrmal enhancement along the brainstem, along the folia of the cerebellum (yellow arrow) and along the fifth intracranial nerve (blue arrow) in a patient with leptomeningeal metastase\\ns.\\nDifferential diagnosis for specific anatomic area:\\nSkull base:\\nCommon skull base tumors are listed in the table on the left. These tumors either arise from extracranial structures like the sinuses (sinonasal carcinoma), or from the skull base i\\ntself (chordoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrous dysplasia). Chordoma is usually located in the midline, while chondrasarcoma usually arises off the midline. On the left a midline tumor ari\\nsing from the clivus. This is the typical presentation of a chordoma. The differential diagnosis would include a metastasis and a chondrosarcoma. On the left another skull base tumo\\nr located off midline. This is a typical presentation for a chondrosarcoma. The differential diagnosis would include a metastasis and a paraganglioma. Chondrosarcomas can be located\\n in the midline and chordomas are sometimes located off midline but those cases are exceptional. On the left an example of a Skull Base Paraganglioma. On the left CT images of a 58-\\nyear-old male with a gradual onset of right facial pain and numbness and a recent onset of double vision. First study the images, than continue. There is an enhancing mass anterior \\nto the skull base and also in the region of the right cavernous sinus. In the bone window setting there is sclerosis of the skull base, particularly in the region of the clivus. Con\\ntinue with the MR images. On the left enhanced sagittal and coronal T1WI. The most striking finding is the black clivus due to the sclerosis. A normal clivus is bright on T1WI as a \\nresult of the fatty bone marrow. There is an enhancing mass anterior to the clivus. On the coronal images we see the enhancement extending through the foramen ovale to the right of \\nthe cavernous sinus. The diagnosis is a nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with intracranial extension. The differential diagnosis would include: skull base metastasis, lymphoma\\n, chronic infection and even a meningioma - although this would be an unusual way for a meningioma to spread.\\nSella/suprasellar:\\nOn the left is a list of common sellar and suprasellar tumors. In this region it is important to keep the possibility of an aneurysm in the differential diagnosis. On the left are i\\nmages of a mass in the suprasellar cistern. On the NECT we can see that it contains calcium. On the T1WI there is a hyperintense area that shows no enhancement (i.e. cystic). There \\nare other components that show enhancement. The tumor is complicated by a hydrocephalus. These findings are very specific for a craniopharyngeoma. On the left NECT and enhanced CT-i\\nmages of a 33-year-old female with severe headache (worse in the a.m.), reduction in visual acuity and visual fields and papilledema. Continue with the MR images. Notice the normal \\ninferiorly displaced pituitary gland. This means it is not a macroadenoma. The diagnosis is again a craniopharyngioma. The differential diagnosis would include an astrocytoma and a \\nmeningioma.\\nCerebello-pontine angle:\\nCommon CP Angle Tumors are listed in the table on the left. On the left a 52-year-old male with hearing loss on the right. The images show an unusual cystic mass with enhancing sept\\nations. There is also some enhancement within the internal acoustic canal. Based on the images the most likely diagnosis would be a cystic schwannoma, but this happened to be an unc\\nommon, cystic presentation of a meningioma.\\nPineal region:\\nCommon pineal region tumors are listed in the table on the left. On the left a tumor located in the pineal region. Based on these images the differential diagnosis would include: Th\\nis happened to be a meningioma. On the left are typical images of a ruptured pineal region dermoid. On the left images of a 12 y/o male with upward gaze paralysis. There is a tumor \\nlocated in the pineal region. The tumor contains calcifications. There is homogeneous enhancement, which is common for a tumor in the pineal region (discussed above). Based on the a\\nge of the patient, the location and the tumor characteristics, this is most likely a germinoma.\\nIntraventricular:\\nCommon intraventricular Tumors are listed in the table on the left. On the left a tumor located in the 3rd ventricle. The tumor contains calcifications. The diagnosis is a giant cel\\nl astrocytoma.\\n4th ventricle:\\nIn children tumors in the 4th ventricle are very common. Astrocytomas are the most common followed by medulloblastomas (or PNET-MB), ependymomas and brainstem gliomas with a dorsal \\nexophytic component. In adults tumors in the 4th ventricle are uncommon. Metastases are most frequently seen, followed by hemangioblastomas, choroid plexus papillomas and dermoid an\\nd epidermoid cysts.\\nTumor Mimics:\\nMany non-tumorous lesions can mimic a brain tumor. Abscesses can mimic metastases. Multiple sclerosis can present with a mass-like lesion with enhancement, also known as tumefactive\\n multiple sclerosis.. In the parasellar region one should always consider the possibility of a aneurysm. Infections and vascular lesions can also mimic a CNS tumor.\\nCharity:\\nAll the profits of the Radiology Assistant go to Medical Action Myanmar which is run by Dr. Nini Tun and Dr. Frank Smithuis sr, who is a professor at Oxford university and happens t\\no be the brother of Robin Smithuis.

Making this diagnosis can sometimes save the patient's life. \\nPreferably, the radiologist should state in every CT-report of a patient with small bowel obstruction whether it is a simple obstruction - which usually has a good prognosis - or a \\nclosed loop obstruction, in which case emergency surgery is necessary. In this video article, we will combine text and videos to illustrate the findings of closed loop obstruction o\\nn CT and in the OR.\\nIntroduction:\\nSmall Bowel Obstruction and Closed Loop:\\nIleus is usually the result of a small bowel obstruction (SBO). In most cases this caused by adhesions, even in patients without prior surgery. An adhesion can cause a simple obstru\\nction; in these cases, we see a change in caliber of the bowel and both the dilated bowel and the collapsed bowel have a normal vascularization. In closed loop obstruction, the smal\\nl bowel is obstructed at two points along its course, thus forming a closed loop. These patients have a high risk of bowel ischemia due to venous infarction, which will result in pe\\nrforation, septic shock and other complications with a high mortality rate. In this video, we have two patients with a small bowel obstruction.\\nThe patient on the left has a simple obstruction at only one point.\\nThe patient on the right however, has a second obstruction caused by the same adhesion.\\nThis second obstruction is more proximal and usually difficult to detect, because both the closed loop as well as the small bowel proximal to this second obstruction are dilated. So\\nrry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\\nWhy is closed loop a difficult diagnosis?:\\nThis video taken in the OR demonstrates how difficult it is for the surgeon to inspect the abdomen in a patient with a closed loop obstruction.\\nIn many cases the surgeon will not make the diagnosis of closed loop obstruction. So, if you as a radiologist do not make the diagnosis, and the surgeon doesn't make the diagnosis, \\nyou will both not know what you have missed. When the radiologist tells the surgeon that there is a small bowel obstruction, probably due to an adhesion, and misses the diagnosis of\\n a closed loop obstruction, there is a good chance that the surgeon - after resecting 2 meters of necrotic bowel two days later - will say to the radiologist.... 'yeah, you were rig\\nht'. Here the axial and coronal CT images. Closed loop obstruction is hard to diagnose on CT because it looks like a simple obstruction caused by an adhesion. You look for a change \\nin caliber of the bowel and once you have found it, you think that the job is done. Look for an odd position of a group of small bowel loops with mesenteric edema and go for the sec\\nond obstruction. The video of the coronal reconstructions better shows the closed loop as well as the two points of obstruction in one plane.\\nRadiological signs of Closed loop obstruction:\\nThe most important signs of a closed loop obstruction on CT are: The bowel loops have a strange arrangement. In most cases, this is due to adhesions, but sometimes due to internal h\\nerniation.\\n2. Mesenteric edema This is edema only on the mesenteric side of the bowel, the result of venous obstruction. Some call this 'wet ischemia' (unlike dry ischemia, which is seen in ar\\nterial ischemia).\\n3. Two points of obstruction This is the ultimate proof of a closed loop obstruction. Other signs that can be seen in patients with closed loop obstruction are: Odd configuration of\\n small bowel loops in patients with a closed loop obstruction\\nOdd configuration of small bowel loops:\\nLook for a strange configuration of small bowel loops clumped together. Sometimes it looks like a volvulus. This is not that strange, since actually a volvulus is a closed loop obst\\nruction of the large bowel. In the large bowel this hardly ever leads to ischemia; unlike a closed loop obstruction of the small bowel. Mesenteric edema\\nMesenteric edema:\\nMesenteric edema is the result of venous obstruction due to strangulation. It is only seen on the mesenteric side of the bowel, unlike the circumferential edema in enteritis or Croh\\nn's disease. Here is a video of a patient with closed loop obstruction demonstrating mesenteric edema. Try to find the mesenteric edema before the green arrow does.\\nTwo points of obstruction:\\nAlthough an odd configuration of bowel loops and mesenteric edema in a patient with a small bowel obstruction are probably a good indication for surgery, finding two points of obstr\\nuction will give you 100% confidence in diagnosing a closed loop obstruction. The two points of obstruction are always within 2 cm of each other so you don't have to look far, but t\\nhey can be in any plane, so you need reconstructions. The video shows you the images without comment first. Try to find the closed loop with the two points of obstruction. Then cont\\ninue the video with commentary.\\nCT protocol:\\ni.v. contrast:\\nGood enhancement of the bowel wall will help you to track the bowel and to find the two stenoses. Sometimes it even helps you to make the diagnosis of ischemia when there is a diffe\\nrence in enhancement. Optimal enhancement of the bowel is in the late arterial phase and starts at about 15-20 seconds after enhancement of the abdominal aorta. A flow of 5cc/sec wi\\nll give a good peak of enhancement in the aorta and thus also in the bowel (see figure). Do not scan in the portal venous phase, because most of the contrast will be gone. Unfortuna\\ntely, some of the patients with a closed loop obstruction are dehydrated.\\nNeed for reconstructions:\\nIn order to find the two stenoses you need reconstructions. Some closed loops are obvious on axial images, but sometimes reconstructions in multiple planes are necessary. In this vi\\ndeo, we demonstrate the importance of reconstructions.\\nOral contrast:\\nThere are two main reasons to not give oral contrast: In my opinion there is almost never a reason to give a patient oral contrast for CT scanning.\\nAdhesions at surgery:\\nMost closed loop obstructions are the result of adhesions - even in patients without a history of prior abdominal surgery.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 224}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Is there always dilatation of bowel?:\\nOf course, the answer to this question is no. The dilatation of the small bowel proximal to the closed loop and the dilatation within the closed loop depend on the amount of obstruc\\ntion at the two stenoses and the time before the patient gets to CT and surgery. In most cases both the proximal bowel and the closed loop are dilated, but sometimes there is only d\\nilatation of the proximal bowel or only of the closed loop. When the obstruction is very acute and there is no time delay, the bowel may not be dilated at all, which can make the di\\nagnosis difficult. Watch the next video... This is a patient without prior surgery who presented at the ER with acute abdominal pain for two hours. This patient has a closed loop ob\\nstruction. Notice that there is no dilatation of the small bowel, both on CT and at surgery. After cleavage of the adhesion the bowel was placed back into the abdomen and re-inspect\\ned after 10 minutes. The 1.5 meter of ischemic bowel had regained a normal color. This patient left the hospital the following day, in good condition.\\nSclerotic bone tumors:\\nHenk Jan van der Woude and Robin Smithuis\\nRadiology department of the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam and the Rijnland hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2013-11-01 In the article Bone Tumors - Differential diagnosis we discussed a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions\\n. The differential diagnosis mostly depends on the age of the patient and the findings on the conventional radiographs. In this article we will discuss the differential diagnosis of\\n sclerotic bone tumors and tumor-like lesions in more detail.\\nIntroduction:\\nHere an illustration of the most common sclerotic bone tumors. In the table the most common sclerotic bone tumors and tumor-like lesions in different age-groups are presented. Fibro\\nus dysplasia and eosinophilic granuloma more commonly present as osteolytic lesions, but they can be sclerotic. Notice that many benign osteolytic lesions that are frequently seen i\\nn younger age groups may heal and appear as sclerotic lesions in the middle aged group. Infection is seen in all ages. Particularly chronic osteomyelitis may have a sclerotic appear\\nance. Another approach to the differential diagnosis of sclerotic bone lesions is to use the mnemonic I VINDICATE, which means 'I clear myself from accusation'. The mnemonic I VINDI\\nCATE is a commonly used mnemonic for the differential diagnostis of any radiological lesion.\\nBone infarction:\\nMultiple bone infarcts Key facts The term bone infarction is used for osteonecrosis within the diaphysis or metaphysis. If the osteonecrosis is located in the epiphysis, the term av\\nascular osteonecrosis is used. The radiograph shows typical bone infarcts in diaphysis and metaphysis of femur and tibia.. On MR imaging bone infarcts are characterized by irregulai\\nr serpentiginous margins with low signal intensity on both T1 and T2 WI and with intermediate to high fat signal in the center part. Enhancement after i.v. Gadolinium is usually min\\nimal or absent (see right image). At the periphery of the infarct a zone of relative high signal intensity on T2WI may be found. Differentiating a bone infarct from an enchondroma o\\nr low-grade chondrosarcoma on plain films can be difficult or even impossible. Cartilaginous tumors in particular chondrosarcoma may show endosteal scalloping, while a bone infarct \\ndoes not. Chrondroid tumors are more frequently encountered than bone infarcts. Here a lesion in the epiphysis, which was the result of post-traumatic osteonecrosis. In the epiphysi\\ns we use the term avascular necrosis and not bone infarction.\\nBone island:\\nKey facts Click here for more information about bone island.\\nChondroblastoma:\\nkey facts: Here a lesion located in the epi- and metaphysis of the proximal humerus. The lesion is predominantly calcified. Coronal T1W image shows lobulated margins and peripheral \\nlow SI due to the calcifications. Click here for more examples of chondroblastoma.\\nChondrosarcoma:\\nLow-grade chondrosarcoma Key facts The image shows a calcified lesion in the proximal tibia without suspicious features. This could very well be an enchondroma. There were other fea\\ntures that favored the diagnosis of a low-grade chondrosarcoma like a positive bone scan and endosteal scalloping of the cortical bone on an MRI (not shown). A chondrosarcoma was di\\nagnosed at biopsy. Here a 44-year old male with a mixed lytic and sclerotic mass arising from the fifth metacarpal bone. There are calcified strands within the soft tissues. T2-weig\\nhted axial MR image demonstrates high signal intensity of the tumor in the metacarpal bone with extension of a lobulated soft tissue mass. Diagnosis: chondrosarcoma grade 2 Here a c\\nhondrosarcoma of the left iliac bone. Because of the large dimensions with soft tissue extension on plain radiograph and axial T2-weighted MR image, a high grade chondrosarcoma was \\nsuspected. Biopsy showed grade 2 chondroarcoma. Continue with the bone scan. Intense uptake on bone scintigraphy as we would expect in high grade chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcoma in h\\numeral head and sternum Here two other lesions in different patients that proved to be chondrosarcoma. The sclerotic lesion in the humeral head could very well be a benign enchondro\\nma based on the imaging findings. Symptoms are usually absent, however, in adult patients with a chondroid lesion in a long bone, particularly of larger size, always consider low-gr\\nade chondrosarcoma. Plain radiograph and coronal T1-weighted contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed MR image of a mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion of the distal femoral diaphysis. Notice \\nthe homogeneous thickening of the cortical bone. There are no calcifications. The MR image shows that the lesion has lobulated contours and nodular enhancement. The homogeneous enha\\nncement in the upper part with edema and cortical thickening are not typical for a low-grade chondrosarcoma. A high grade chondrosarcoma must be considered in the differential diagn\\nosis. Biopsy revealed dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma.\\nPeripheral chondrosarcoma:\\nKey facts Consider peripheral chondrosaroma in growing osteochondromas with or without pain after closure of the physeal plate. Radiographic or CT features that suggest malignancy: \\nUse MRI with water-sensitive sequence (T2 FS) to determine cartilage cap thickness. Consider progression of osteohondroma to chondrosarcoma when cartilage cap measures > 10 mm. Clic\\nk here for more examples of chondrosarcoma.\\nPeriosteal or juxtacortical chondrosarcoma:\\nA juxtacortical chondrosarcoma has be considered in the differential diagnosis when a mineralized lesion adjacent to the cortical bone is seen. Here a partially calcified mass again\\nst the proximal humerus with involvement of the cortical bone on an axial CT image. T2-weighted MR image reveals a lobulated mass with high signal intensity. The bone marrow compart\\nment is not involved which is important for the surgical strategy. A periosteal chondroma may have the same imaging characteristics, however, these are almost always much smaller. P\\nlain radiograph in another patient shows irreglar mineralized lesion with elevation of the periosteum and cortical involvement. On the right T2-WI with FS of same patient.. The juxt\\nacortical mass has a high SI and lobulated contours. DD: juxtacortical chondrosarcoma, parosteal osteosarcoma.\\nEnchondroma:\\nMost commonly encountered bone tumor in the small bones of the hand and foot. Here on a radiograph the typical calcifications in the chondroid matrix of an enchondroma. Notice how e\\nasily MRI depicts these lesions. Enchondroma is a fairly common benign cartilaginaous lesion which may present as an entirely lytic lesion without any calcification, as a dense calc\\nified lesion or as a mixed leson with osteolysis and calcifications. Enchondromas aswell as low-grade chondrosarcomas are frequently encountered as coincidental findings in patients\\n who have a MRI or bone scan for other reasons.

This image is of a 20 year old patient with a sclerotic expansile lesion in the clavicle. Notice that there ar\\ne small areas of ill-defined osteolysis. In an older patient one should first consider an osteoblastic metastasis. If the patient had fever and a proper clinical setting, osteomyeli\\ntis would be in the differential diagnosis.

Ossifications or calcifications can be present in variable amounts. Here a\\n rather wel-defined eccentric lesion which is predominantly sclerotic. The differential diagnosis includes: Here a well-defined mixed sclerotic-lytic lesion of the left iliac bone. \\nThe diagnosis was fibrous dysplasia. DD: old SBC. Bone scintigraphy can be either negative or show limited uptake. The signal intensity on MR depends on the amount of calcifications\\n and ossifications and fibrous tissue (low SI) and cystic components (high SI on T2). Fibrous dysplasia can be monostotic or polyostotic. Usually it is a lesion of childhood or youn\\ng adults. Not infrequently encountered as coincidental finding at later age. Central location most common with some expansion and cortical thinning Click here for more detailed info\\nrmation about fibrous dysplasia.\\nMelorrheostosis:\\nMelorrheostosis is a dysplasia of the bone, characterized by apposition of mature bone on the outer or inner surface of cortical bone. Usually one bone is involved. The epiphysis, m\\netaphysis and diaphysis may be involved. Usually new bone is added to one side of the cortex only. Complete envelopment may occur.

Here images of a patient with breast cancer. There is a metastasi\\ns, which presents as a subtle sclerotic lesion in the humerus metaphysis. This could be an osteoblastic metastasis or an osteolytic metastasis that responded to chemotherapy.

Notice that CT depicts these lesions far bet\\nter (red arrows). Here CT-images of a patient with prostate cancer. Notice the numerous ill-defined osteoblastic metastases.\\nNon-ossifying fibroma:\\nNon-ossifying fibroma (NOF) can be encoutered occasionally as a partial or completely sclerotic lesion. Typically a NOF presents as an eccentric well-defined lytic lesion, usually f\\nound as a coincidental finding. These lesions usually regress spontaneously and may then become sclerotic. Other benign lesions, like solitary bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, chondrob\\nlastoma and other benign bone tumors may become inert and may also become sclerotic. The images show on the left a typical osteolytic NOF with a sharp sclerotic border. The image on\\n the right is of a different patient who has an old NOF that shows complete fill in. Click here for more detailed information about NOF. Here an incidental finding of several eccent\\nric sclerotic lesions of the distal femur. These are inert filled-in non-ossifying fibromas. No further examination is needed.\\nOsteochondroma:\\nOsteochondroma is a bony protrusion covered by a cartilaginous cap. Growth of the osteochondroma takes place in the cap, corresponding with normal enchondral growth at the growth pl\\nates. Accordingly, growth of osteochondromas is allowed until a patient reaches adulthood and the physeal plates are closed. Growth of osteochondromas at adult ages, which is charac\\nterized by a thick cartilaginous cap (high SI on T2WI) should raise the suspicion of progression to a peripheral chondrosarcoma. Here a patient with a broad-based osteochondroma. No\\ntice that the cortical bone extends into the lesion. This feature differentiates it from a juxtacortical tumor. Here a patient with a broad-based osteochondroma with extension of th\\ne cortical bone into the stalk of the lesion. Notice the lytic peripheral part with subtle calcifications. This part corresponds to a zone of high SI on T2-WI with FS on the right. \\nThis represents a thick cartilage cap. This is an example of progression of an osteochondroma to a peripheral chondrosarcoma. Malignant transformation Radiographic features that sho\\nuld raise the suspicion of malignant transformation on plain radiographs or CT include:\\nOsteoid osteoma:\\nOsteoid osteoma key facts: Here the reactive sclerosis is the most obvious finding on the X-ray. There is reactive sclerosis with a nidus that is barely visible on the radiograph (b\\nlue arrow), but clearly visible on the CT (red arrows). CT scan is usually very helpful in detecting the nidus and differentiating osteoid osteoma from other sclerotic lesions like \\nosteoblastoma, osteomyelitis, arthritis, stress fracture and enostosis. MRI also may detect the nidus, combined with abundant bone marrow and soft tissue edema. Osteoid osteoma (2) \\nIn most cases of osteoid osteoma the radiographic appearance is determined by the reactive sclerosis. In some cases however the osteolytic nidus can be visible on the radiograph (fi\\ngure).\\nOsteoma:\\nkey facts Osteoma consists of densely compact bone. It is most commonly located in the outer table of the neurocranium or in a paranasal sinus.\\nOsteomyelitis:\\nOsteomyelitis is a mimicker of various benign and malignant bone tumors and reactive processes that may be accompanied by reactive sclerosis. Acute osteomyelitis is characterised by\\n osteolysis. Sclerosis is usually the most prominent finding in subacute and chronic osteomyelitis. A periosteal reaction with or without layering may be present. Sometimes a more s\\nolid periosteal reaction is present combined with cortical thickening and broadening of the bone. Here an image of a patient with chronic osteomyelitis. Centrally there is an ill-de\\nfined osteolytic area. The major part of the lesion consists of reactive sclerosis.\\nOsteosarcoma:\\nKey facts Osteosarcoma (2) Here images of an osteosarcoma in the right femur. It is barely visible within the bone, but an agressive periostitis is seen (arrow). Continue with the M\\nR-images. The sagittal T1WI and Gd-enhanced T1W-image with fatsat show a large tumor mass infiltrating a large portion of the distal femur and extending through the cortex into the \\nsoft tissues.\\nParosteal osteosarcoma:\\nParosteal osteosarcoma is a sarcoma that has it's origin on the surface of the bone. It grows primarily into the surrounding soft tissues, but may also infiltrate into the bone marr\\now. It is nost commonly located on the posterior side of the distal meta-diaphysis of the femur. Ossification in parosteal osteosaroma is usually more mature in the center than at t\\nhe periphery. This is opposed to myositis ossificans which may present very close to the cortical bone, but maturation develops from the center to the periphery.\\nPaget's disease of bone:\\nPaget disease is a chronic disorder of unknown origin with increased breakdown of bone and formation of disorganized new bone. The most common appearance is the mixed lytic-scleroti\\nc. In this case we see the pathognomonic triad of bone expansion, cortical thickening and trabecular bone thickening in the mixed lytic and sclerotic phase of Paget's disease of rig\\nht hemipelvis.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 226}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Reactive processes:\\nMyositis ossificans:\\nHere a patient with a mineralized mass in the soft tissues. Notice that the mineralization is predominantly in the periphery of the mass and that there is a lucent zone between the \\nmass and the cortical bone. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement of the mass with extensive surrounding edema. This is consistent with the d\\niagnosis of a reactive process like myositis ossificans.\\nStress fractures:\\nStress fractures occur in normal (fatigue fractures) or metabolically weakened (insufficiency fractures) bones. Usually stress fractures are easy to recognize. Uncommonly it can be \\ndifficult to differentiate a stress fracture from a pathologic fracture, that occurs at the site of a bone tumor. Uncommonly it can be difficult to differentiate a stress fracture f\\nrom a bone tumor like an osteoid osteoma or from a pathologic fracture, that occurs at the site of a bone tumor. Here an example of a patient with a stress fracture of the distal fi\\nbula. Coronal MR image demonstrates subtle low intensity line representing the fracture. Differential diagnosis based on the periosteal reaction and the extensive edema:\\nPosttraumatic calcifications:\\nHere a patient with a juxtacortical sclerotic mass of the proximal humerus (left). This proved to be a reactive calcification secondary to trauma. Notice the resemblance to a juxtac\\nortical mass in another patient (right), which was a biopsy proven parosteal osteosarcoma. This shows that differentiating a tumor from a reactive proces scan be quite difficult in \\nsome cases. When a reactive process is more likely based on history and imaging features, follow-up is sometimes still needed.\\nSubungual exostoses:\\nSubungual exostoses are bony projections which arise from the dorsal surface of the distal phalanx, most commonly of the hallux. These lesions are not osteochondromas, but consist o\\nf reactive cartilage metaplasia. The radiographic appearance and location are typical.\\nNora's lesion:\\nHere two patients with a bizar parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (BPOP), also called Nora's lesion. This benign reactive process is most commonly found adjacent to the cort\\nex of phalanges of hands or feet (75%). The cortical bone and bone marrow compartment are not involved. Rapid growth of the mineralized mass is not uncommon.

In part I we discussed the\\n MR features of various muscle injuries. In part II we will discuss non-traumatic muscle changes.\\nIntroduction:\\nWhen assessing muscle pathology try to decide which one of the four basic patterns of abnormality is present: Some of these conditions, such as polymyositis, require biopsy for appr\\nopriate therapy to be initiated. In other conditions, such as myositis ossificans, biopsy should be avoided because it may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of a neoplasm and thus to i\\nnappropriate therapy. Clues to the correct diagnosis and whether biopsy is necessary are often present on the MR images, especially when they are correlated with clinical features a\\nnd the findings from other imaging modalities (1). The patient on the left had slipped on the ice in the hospital parking lot and torn the hamstrings. The hamstring tear was associa\\nted with sciatic neuritis, when the sciatic nerve became irritated by the hematoma.\\nMuscle Edema:\\nMuscle edema is the most common MR-pattern. It is hard to make a specific diagnosis based on the MR-findings alone. Be sure to get the right history because it usually provides the \\nclue. The most common cause of muscle edema is trauma, which was discussed in Muscle MR imaging - Part I. Muscle MR imaging - Part I: traumatic muscle changes\\nInflammatory myopathy:\\nInflammatory myopathy is a term that defines a group of muscle diseases involving inflammation of skeletal muscle and often the adjacent fascia, with elevated CPK. They are thought \\nto be autoimmune disorders. When using the term inflammatory myopathy, one is actually considering three separate disease entities, namely dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), a\\nnd inclusion body myositis (IBM). On the left an example of inflammatory myopathy. Note increased signal of all the muscles, in all the compartments. This is edema. There is also so\\nme edema of the subcutaneous tissues. It is very unusual for a trauma, for example, to present with edema in all compartments. There are no fluid collections within the muscles, but\\n notice the perifascial fluid collections. On the left a patient with myositis. Again we see that multiple compartments are affected, there is a vast amount of edema, skin involveme\\nnt and perifascial fluid. It is non-specific but myositis could be suggested. Inflammatory myositis is generally bilaterally symmetrical. MR features of myositis include normal arch\\nitecture on T1-weighted images, feathery edema with enhancement, skin reticulation and abnormalities NOT limited to specific compartmental or neural anatomy.\\nPolymyositis:\\nOn the left a patient with polymyositis (PM), one of the inflammatory myopathies. The large proximal muscles are involved, generally in a symmetric pattern. Generally speaking, not \\nall muscles are involved, so MR can help locate the best area for biopsy. Sometimes whole body MR is used for diagnosis and follow-up of polymyositis after steroid therapy has been \\ninitiated.\\nInclusion body myositis:\\nInduction body myositis, one of the inflammatory myopathies, is a more recently recognized form of myositis of unknown cause. It is the most common acquired myopathy in patients > 5\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 227}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"0 years and makes up about a quarter (16-28%) of all inflammatory myopathies, although inflammation is not a prominent feature in this disease. It is an indolent disease and there a\\nre no skin changes. The muscles that tend to be involved are the deltoid, quadriceps (see next example), finger flexors and ankle dorsiflexors. Patients present with muscle weakness\\n, the disease owes its name to the histological finding of vacuoles and filamentous inclusions. Although the findings are non-specific, it is worth considering this diagnosis in a o\\nlder patient with abnormalities of the above mentioned muscles. Inclusion body myositis On the left a patient with inclusion body myositis. Notice the symmetrical involvement of the\\n quadriceps and the lack of edema in the surrounding tissues.\\nMyositis in collagen vascular disease:\\nPatients with underlying collagen vascular diseases can develop myositis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease and Sjogr\\nen syndrome. For example, as in this patient with SLE, it can be very focal (coronal image, right leg, adductor loge) or nodular. A type of nodular myositis is focal proliferative m\\nyositis, it is the least common form. This can be seen in association not only with collagen vascular diseases but also lymphoma. The lesion caused by myositis is sometimes indistin\\nguishable from lymphoma itself, and biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis. On the left another patient with focal nodular myositis which looks like any other mass on T1-weighted\\n, T2-weighted, and post contrast. With a history of lymphoma you could suggest focal nodular myositis, but there is nothing definitive about the images. The relationship of myositis\\n to underlying malignancy remains controversial, and the frequency of this association is not well established. 2 types of cancer show a relationship with myositis: ovarian cancer a\\nnd Non-Hodgkin lymphoma\\n(shown on the left a patient with, strangely enough, metastatic thyroid cancer). Myositis can precede malignancy (as in a paraneoplastic syndrome), which is not to say that routine \\nscreening for malignancy\\nis called for in patients presenting with myositis.\\nRadiation myositis:\\nMyositis due to radiation can be seen many years after the therapy. It seems to be a vascular problem which doesn't disappear after cessation of the therapy. The history is usually \\nthe clue, but also you may see a band like appearance where the radiation changes in the muscles stop, corresponding with the radiation field. Graves disease\\nGraves disease:\\nOn the left a well-known example of inflammatory myopathy which has an endocrine etiology: Graves disease, otherwise known as thyroid eye disease. The inflammation of the eye muscle\\ns and orbital fat with subsequent volume increase leads to proptosis. Graves disease Same patient, coronal T2-weighted image. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) myositis\\nDrug induced myositis:\\nSeveral drugs can induce myositis and in the author's practice the most frequent culprit seems to be a lipid-lowering statin. In a significant number of patients statins induce musc\\nle pain and myositis, the dosage then needs to be decreased or the drug needs to be discontinued. On the left an example, note the inflammatory changes in the large muscles around t\\nhe buttocks. After discontinuation of the drug, the muscle pain will disappear in about 2 weeks, the MRI however will still show abnormalities until roughly a month later. The best \\ntime to do a follow-up MR is about 6 weeks after stopping the drug. Lipitor myositis Coronal T1-weighted and T2-weighted with fatsat This was an older patient with elevated choleste\\nrol who was put on Lipitor. The patient developed muscle aches and pains, CPK was mildly elevated. The changes are rather subtle, we see perifascial fluid collections, around the ed\\nges of the muscle (the epimysium). Also there are minimal skin changes. HIV myositis\\nHIV myositis:\\nAntiretroviral drugs (used in HIV positive patients) can also cause myositis because they interfere with the mitochondrial repair mechanism. The abnormalities are very similar to th\\nose in myositis induced by lipid-lowering statins. Again, the patients present with weakness and pain, the changes are centrally located in the larger muscles. The differential in H\\nIV positive patients is relatively long (autoimmune, HIV wasting syndrome with type II muscle fiber atrophy,\\ndenervation and infection). It is obviously important to be able to rule out infection in these patients. One way to differentiate between the two is to look for symmetry. Zidovudin\\ne (AZT) myopathy, or HIV myositis, is symmetrical.\\nInfection is usually unilateral or at least asymmetrical. T1-weighted image with fatsat post contrast Fluid collections within the enhancing muscle in a patient with pyomyositis\\nMyositis due to infection:\\nMuscle infection or myositis without abscess or necrosis may produce edema as the sole abnormality on MR images. The MR images and clinical history may suggest the presence of such \\nan infection. Bacterial myositis frequently progresses to abscess formation and thus often has a masslike appearance on MR images. Viral infection does not progress to abscess forma\\ntion. Muscle infection can be due to: Important groups at risk for muscle infection are diabetics, immuno-compromised patients, patients with a penetrating wound (including ulcers t\\nhat cause infection to spread deep or skin infections). The hallmark of muscle infection is fluid collections present inside the muscle (figure). Pyomyositis\\nPyomyositis:\\nOn the left T2-weighted, T2FS, and post contrast sagittal images of the knee. On the T2-weighted image we see a posterior mass with inflammatory changes in the surrounding muscles. \\nThe T2-weighted image with fatsat shows an ill-defined fluid collection and the inflammatory changes in the muscle are clearer. So far this is a non-specific finding. It could be a \\ntumor but tumors tend not to have so much inflammatory change around them. Lack of central enhancement combined with surrounding inflammatory changes and a suggestive history will h\\nelp to make the diagnosis of pyomyositis. Pyomyositis Same patient, T1-weighted image post Gadolineum with fatsat. Pyomyositis (2) On the left another example of pyomyositis, much m\\nore extensive, in a patient with AIDS who had a loculated abscess. Note the thick enhancing walls. On the left another case of pyomyositis. Note the asymmetry with enlargement of th\\ne left extremity. There is subcutaneous, fascial, and muscular inflammation. Generally speaking muscle infection is a clinical diagnosis, but MR can help determine the depth and ext\\nent of the disease. MR also is helpful to locate fluid collections or abscess formation, which can then be aspirated for culture. Pyomyositis (3) On the left bilateral psoas abscess\\nes as a complication of osteomyelitis of the spine in a patient with TB. Necrotizing fasciitis\\nNecrotizing fasciitis:\\nNecrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection of the deeper layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues, easily spreading across the fascial plane within the subcutaneous tissue. Group A st\\nreptococcus is the most frequent pathogen found in necrotizing fasciitis. These bacteria are sometimes called 'flesh-eating bacteria', which is a misnomer as the bacteria do not act\\nually eat the tissue. They cause the destruction of skin and muscle by releasing toxins, which include streptococcal pyogenic exotoxins. Sarcoidosis\\nSarcoidosis:\\nOn the left an example of another inflammatory disease: Sarcoidosis. Sarcoid is confusing on MR, because you will see changes in the skin and a peculiar nodular enhancement pattern \\nin the muscle. 1-2% of patients with active sarcoid will have muscle involvement and there are always skin changes on the overlying skin. The enhancement pattern is also referred to\\n as the 'Stars and Stripes' pattern, mostly because of the stripes on the long axis of the muscle.

There obviously is a wide range of amount of fat present. Far left an example o\\nf an olympic gymnast with 6% body fat.\\nNext to it an example of most of us mortals, the so called couch potato, with much more intra- and inter-muscular fat.\\nAtrophy patterns:\\nThe image on the far left demonstrates fatty infiltration of muscle in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropa\\nthy or peroneal muscular atrophy. It affects both motor and sensory peripheral nerves. The image next to it demonstrates atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle. The supraspinatus muscl\\ne is small and there is peritendinous atrophy. This is the pattern that you will see when the tendon is torn and there is disuse.\\nDenervation and Peripheral nerve entrapment:\\nIn the acute phase of denervation, the MR is normal. In the early subacute phase after one week, there will be uniform muscle edema and paradoxical hypertrophy (the muscle looks swo\\nllen). In the late subacute phase after 3 weeks, there will be mixed edema and atrophy. The chronic phase is characterized by only atrophy. Denervation due to cervical root avulsion\\n On the left a patient with cervical root avulsion. The para-spinal musculature shows a mixture of edema and atrophy, 3 weeks post-trauma. On the left a patient with peroneal nerve \\nentrapment by a ganglion, leading to atrophy of the peroneus longus, peroneus brevis and the anterior compartment. Note the increased signal intensity of the anterior muscles, due t\\no edema, meaning early atrophy. On the left an example of atrophy in a patient with a resection arthroplasty of the right hip (Girdlestone procedure). There is atrophy of the thigh \\nmusculature and gluteal muscles due to disuse. There is a decrease in size of the muscles and there is fatty replacement in a peritendinous pattern. On the left a patient with a gan\\nglion (blue arrow) in the shoulder. Stop and think for a moment about what causes ganglions in the shoulder. There is a subtle increase in signal in the infraspinatus muscle (yellow\\n arrow), due to edema. Remember that the early subacute stage of denervation presents with edema. The nerve is being impinged by the ganglion. This patient had a labral tear (not pi\\nctured), which can lead to ganglion formation. It is important to make this diagnosis while the muscle is not yet atrophic. If the ganglion is aspirated or removed on time, the nerv\\ne function will be restored before the muscle becomes atrophic. On the left a different patient with a paralabral ganglion (not pictured). There is atrophy of both the supraspinatus\\n and infraspinatus muscle. There is volume loss and edema, without any focal fluid colllections. Obturator nerve clipped at surgery On the left a case in which the obturator nerve w\\nas clipped at surgery. This is the chronic phase where there is volume loss and fatty replacement of the muscle. On the left another patient with a tear of the posterior labrum and \\na paralabral cyst. Study the images and try to determine if there is any atrophy. Then continue with the T1-weighted image. This case illustrates how important it is to include a T1\\n-weighted image to your exam! If you were to have only the T2-weighted image with fat sat, you would miss the atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle, which has been entirely replaced b\\ny fat. The chronic phase of denervation is characterized by only atrophy. On the left images of a patient with an Erb's palsy. On the left images of a patient with chronic denervati\\non due to polio. On the left a patient with edema of both the deltoid muscle and the supraspinatus. This is an important observation since these muscles are innervated by different \\nnerves. The deltoid muscle is innervated by the axillary nerve and supraspinatus muscle by the suprascapular nerve. This means that the lesion is more proximal. This patient had Par\\nsonage-Turner Syndrome, also known as brachial neuritis. This is an inflammatory disorder characterized by severe pain, followed by weakness due to denervation. Note also edema of t\\nhe infraspinatus muscle.\\nMuscular dystrophy:\\nMuscular dystrophy is a less common cause of atrophy. It is diagnosed clinically usually in children, with patients experiencing symmetrical muscle weakness, pseudohypertrophy of th\\ne calves and difficulty in standing up. The muscle initially is edematous and then rapidly becomes atrophic. There are many types of muscular dystrophy. The most common type is Duch\\nenne. On the left an example of adult onset muscular dystrophy. There is subtle high signal intensity of the quadriceps muscle bilaterally due to edema, with a feathery appearance. \\nMost of the adductor muscle is normal. Note the lack of skin edema. This is an important finding to be able to differentiate from inflammatory myositis, in which the skin is also ed\\nematous. The imaging findings correspond to the acute stage of muscular dystrophy. In a chronic setting, the muscle will be atrophied with fatty replacement. On the left T1- and T2-\\nweighted images of the thigh muscles. Notice that there is an obvious difference between the signal intensities of the quadriceps muscle and the posterior muscles. On the T1-weighte\\nd image only the posterior muscles contain normal fat. On the T2-weighted image there is edema of the quadriceps, which is a sign of early muscular dystrophy. Although the exact dia\\ngnosis cannot be made by MR, it can be helpful in suggesting a location for biopsy to determine the type of muscle degenerative disease. On the left an example of chronic muscular d\\nystrophy. The muscle has been entirely replaced by fat. When the muscle loses its nerve supply it becomes atrophic. Dysfunction at any level of the motor unit can lead to denervatio\\nn with muscle atrophy as a result.\\nAccessory muscles:\\nAccessory soleus muscle Accessory muscles may present as an asymptomatic painless mass or with symptoms of nerve entrapment or vascular entrapment. On the left an example of an acce\\nssory soleus, on the medial side of the ankle, which caused compression of the tibial nerve (i.e. tarsal tunnel syndrome). In order to diagnose this entity, you must be really famil\\niar with the anatomy of the area being studied. Patients with accessory muscles will usually present with a painless mass, which will be marked by the lab technician. Initially, the\\n MR appears normal. However, be aware that there are 3 questions that you must consider in these cases: Accessory peroneocalcaneus internus muscle On the left a wrist examination sh\\nowing an accessory forearm flexor muscle. Accessory extensor digitorum manus brevis On the left an example of an accessory muscle at the dorsum of the wrist (T1- and T2-weighted). U\\nnder the marker is a well-defined mass, iso-intense to normal muscle. It is a muscle at mid-carpal level, with normal signal. Normally, at this level, there is no muscle on the exte\\nnsor side of the wrist, just tendon. This is an accessory extensor digitorum manus brevis. A recent article in Radiographics lists the accessory muscles in the human body\\n(Sookur PA et al. Accessory Muscles: Anatomy, Symptoms, and Radiologic Evaluation. Radiographics 2008;28:481-499). Accessory soleus muscle On the left an example of a common accesso\\nry muscle: the accessory soleus. Normally the soleus muscle inserts almost entirely onto the achilles tendon with a very small soleal tendon passing anteriorly to the achilles tendo\\nn. In about 1-2% of the population however, the soleus comes down and inserts directly onto the calcaneus. This will present as a palpable mass and is usually, but not always, bilat\\neral. Accessory soleus muscle On the left a low lying soleus muscle, but it did not have a separate tendinous insertion on the calcaneus. Accessory muscle posterior to the neurovasc\\nular bundle On the left another example of an accessory muscle which lies medial to the flexor hallucis longus (middle) and peroneus brevis (lateral). This is a common area for acce\\nssory muscles, and there are a lot of different muscles that can be found here (to differentiate you need to determine where the tendon inserts).

Long-Standing Morel-Lavalle Lesions of the Trochanteric Region and Proximal Thigh: MRI Features in Five Patients by J. M. Mellado et al. AJR 2004; 182:1289-1294\\nArthritis:\\nLaurens van Baardewijk, Frank Looijmans, Frank Smithuis and Matthieu Rutten\\nMáxima MC, Cooperative Lumirad U.A., Amsterdam University Medical Center, Jeroen Bosch Hospital and Radboud University Medical Center in The Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2023-01-15 In this article we provide an overview of the different imaging findings of common joint diseases as a useful tool in daily musculoskeletal radiology. Art\\nhritis is a challenging topic. A long list of diagnoses has to be considered when looking at X rays of the hand and feet, each with its own extensive set of findings. \\nSometimes the abnormalities are pathognomonic for a specific disease, but more often the findings are non-specific because there is a lot of overlap between different joint diseases\\n. When you start looking at arthritis cases, remember the following: You can click on all images for an enlarged view.\\nSystematic Approach:\\nModified from Jacobson, et al. Radiology 2008 (2) This flow chart shows the approach to the radiographic evaluation of arthritis. In the presence of joint space narrowing, it is imp\\nortant to differentiate degenerative from inflammatory conditions. Degenerative joint diseaseThis is characterized by osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis with an asymmetric distri\\nbution both when you compare left and right as well as within the joint itself. Usually it is typical osteoarthritis. \\nWhen findings are atypical (unusual combination of age, affected joint and severity) think of posttraumatic, CPPD, neuropathic or rare diseases like hemophilic arthritis. Inflammato\\nry joint diseaseThis is characterized by bone erosions, osteopenia, soft-tissue swelling and uniform, symmetric joint space loss.\\nInflammation of a single joint should raise concern for infection.\\nMultiple symmetric joint inflammation in a proximal distribution in the hands or feet without bone proliferation suggests rheumatoid arthritis.\\nWhen the inflammation is more in a distal distribution in the hands or feet with bone proliferation it suggests a seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SpA).\\nSpA is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases associated with HLA-B27 (2).\\nAxial SpA - most commonly ankylosing spondylitis -  is located more in the axial skeleton.\\nPeripheral SpA - like psoriatic, reactive and IBD-associated arthritis -  is located more in the peripheral skeleton.\\nABCDE-S:\\nJoint diseases have variable manifestations with an overlap of radiological features. \\nThe ABCDE-S mnemonic is a helpful tool for a systematic and complete radiological interpretation and reporting. \\nWe use the ABCDE-S, which stands for Articular, Bone, Cartilage, Distribution,Extra's and Soft tissue.\\nThere are variants of this mnemonic. Some use ABCDE  for Alignment,  Bone, Cartilage, Distribution and Effusion.\\nArticular - erosions:\\nMarginal erosions \\nThey occur at the bare area of the joint, where the bone is not covered by articular cartilage. They are typically seen in rheumatoid arthritis (MCP-joints) and psoriatic arthritis \\n(DIP). Subchondral erosions \\nThey occur at the subchondral bone plate of the articular surfaces. They are a typical feature of erosive osteoarthritis. Gullwing deformityIn erosive osteoarthritis the combination\\n of central erosions and osteophytes results in a gullwing deformity. Pencil-in-cup deformity\\nIn psoriatic arthritis the combination of marginal erosions and bone proliferation can result in a pencil-in-cup deformity. Peri- or juxtaarticular erosions. \\nGout erosions are a bit more eccentric juxta-articular located, where the joint capsule attaches to the bone. They are most often seen in the MTP1-joint. Typical examples of specifi\\nc erosion patterns Alignment Some use the A of ABCDE-S for Alignment.\\nThe problem however is that misalignment or malalignment can be seen in all end-stage joint diseases, whether it is degenerative or inflammatory.\\nBone - formation:\\nBone formation or proliferation is seen in many joint diseases and especially in osteoarthritis, DISH and spondyloarthritis like ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. \\nIt is NOT present in the active phase of rheumatoid arthritis.

Peri-articular demineralization develops as a result of the hyperemia of the in\\nflamed synovium and soft tissues.\\nSubchondral sclerosis is typically seen in osteoarthritis. Also in patients with neuropathic arthritis. Images\\nHere two examples of periarticular osteopenia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\\nThe osteopenia can be very subtle.\\nIt may help to play with the window width settings (detail views in the center) or to look through your eyelashes to see the osteopenia.\\nCartilage:\\nDegenerative diseases affect the cartilage non-uniformly or asymmetrically, since this is the result of mechanical load, which is not evenly distributed throughout the joint. Inflam\\nmatory diseases affect the cartilage uniformly, since the synovitis is present in the entire joint. Click on image to enlarge.\\nDistribution:\\nUnderstanding distribution patterns is a very powerful tool, since most common diseases (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis) have distinctive patterns. \\nIn the following chapters on the various joint diseases, we will start each chapter with an illustration of the distribution.

No erosions. Clinical Radiological findings Teaching point:Many arthropathies sh\\now secondary osteoarthritis in a later stage. In the knee, osteoarthritis is classified by the Kellgren and Lawrence classification. \\nThis classification can be used when grading degeneration in other joints, but it is primarily designed for the knee.

G\\nCMC1 osteoarthritis\\nNon uniform joint space narrowing of the CMC 1 joint with osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis. \\nThere is a large subchonderal cyst in the base of the first metacarpal (white arrow). HSTT osteoarthritisNon uniform joint space narrowing of the scaphotrapeziotrapezoid (STT) joint\\n with osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis. This is a difficult case. Dominant finding is non-uniform joint space narrowing in CMC and DIP joints. So this patient has oste\\noarthritis. The severity of findings may suggest erosive osteoarthritis. However, there is also joint space narrowing of the MCP joints and a possible erosion in the lunate bone. Wi\\nthout abnormalities in the PIP joints it is very unlikely that these abnormalities are all due to osteoarthritis. Most likely this patient has both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoart\\nhritis.\\nRheumatoid Arthritis:\\nKey findingsSymmetrical uniform cartilage damage with marginal erosions predominantly in MCP-joints and the carpus, not in DIP-joints. No bone proliferation. Clinical Radiological f\\nindings Typical marginal erosions and joint space narrowing of MCP 3-5. \\nAlso note the uniform joint space narrowing of the MCP joints.\\nThe PIP-joints only show minimal joint space narrowing. End stage Rheumatoid arthritis. This is a case with end stage rheumatoid arthritis with severe erosive changes and ligamentou\\ns ruptures causing dislocation of the MCP joints. Scapholunate dissociation (white arrow) is a common finding due to diffuse carpal inflammation. Both the dissociation and inflammat\\nion can cause joint space narrowing in the radiocarpal joint. Notice also the erosion in the distal ulna with surrounding soft tissue swelling (blue arrow). Rheumatoid arthritis in \\nthe feet In this case of rheumatoid arthritis there are marginal erosions adjacent to almost all MTP joints (arrowheads).\\nThe 5th MTP joint is most frequently involved in  rheumatoid arthritis.\\nWhen erosions are as severe as in this case, it can look like pencil-in-cup deformity (white arrow) as is frequently seen in psoriatic arthritis. \\nHowever, the primarily affected MTP joints distribution and less affected interphalangeal joints is the clue that this is a case of rheumatoid arthritis.

Atlanto-axial subluxation due to rheumatoid arthritis of the cervical spine\\nAtlanto-axial subluxation:\\nThe cervical spine is often affected in rheumatoid arthritis and can present as atlantoaxial instability, subaxial subluxation or basilar invagination with cranial settling.\\nCranial settling occurs when the dens extends into the foramen magnum. Atlanto-axial subluxation is an important and potentially life threatening complication of rheumatoid arthriti\\ns. It is defined when the space between the dens of C2 and the arch of the atlas exceeds more than 3 mm. It is caused by inflammatory ligamentous laxity. Instability in this joint m\\nay result in numerous neurological symptoms due to compression of the spinal cord. Images In flexion of the cervical spine there is widening of the distance (14 mm) between the dens\\n and the posterior surface of the anterior atlas ring (normal ≤3 mm). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nBasilar invagination:\\nBasilar invagination also called cranial settling or basilar impression occurs in 5-10% of patients with cervical rheumatoid arthritis. In basilar invagination the odontoid is prola\\npsing into the foramen magnum limiting the space for the spinal cord. Clinical presentations range from chronic headaches, limited neck motion to acute neurologic deterioration (spi\\nnal cord and brain stem compression, which can lead to paralysis or even death if the neck is moved in certain positions).

ClinicalSeptic arthritis, also called infectious arthritis, is usually an acute mon\\no-arthritis.  \\nIt is secondary to bacteremia, local spread of infection or a complication of surgery or injection. \\nSeptic arthritis leads to rapid joint destruction and  requires prompt aspiration or drainage.

There have some key features in common, including: \\nSpondyloarthritis can further be divided into an axial and a peripheral type.\\nAnkylosing spondylitis is the most common axial type and the prototypical type of spondyloarthritis. \\nThe most common peripheral types are psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis and enteropathic arthritis (associated with inflammatory bowel diseases). Classification criteria for Sp\\nA from the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) are: The clinical features of spondyloarthritis are listed in the table.\\nAnkylosing Spondylitis:\\nKey findings\\nAxial arthropathy, with enthesitis (edema, shiny corners), syndesmophytes and sacro-iliitis. ClinicalSignificant back pain, morning stiffness and disability. \\nThe onset is in the 3rd and 4th decade and the prevalence is about 1%.\\nAnkylosing Spondylitis is the prototypical type of seronegative, axial SpA and primarily affects the spine and SI-joints although other joints like shoulders, hips, ribs, heels and \\nsmall joints of the hands and feet can become involved. Radiological Early stage ankylosing spondylitis Enthesitis\\nInflammation of the enthesis is one of the hallmarks of SpA. \\nThe earliest sign of ankylosing spondylitis is edema at the enthesis, which is only visible on MRI (white arrow). \\nIn a later stage sclerosis will present as shiny corners on X-rays or CT.\\nFinally syndesmophytes are formed along these enthesis (see next images). Images \\nThree different patients with typical features of early stage ankylosing spondylitis: Ankylosing spondylitis Syndesmophytes\\nThese images show syndesmophytes in the lumbar spine and ossification of the paraspinal ligaments.\\nWhen these syndesmophytes fuse, this produces the typical “bamboo spine” appearance. Also note the ossification of the intervertebral disc and ankylosis of the facet joints. Syndesm\\nophytes have a typically vertical orientation.\\nBridging and fusing is quite common.\\nAs a result the spine looses its flexibility and can easily fracture even after a minor trauma.

Ankylosing spondylitis of the humeral head The Hatchet sign is a circumscribed erosion of the lateral-dorsal aspect of the humeral head leading to a hatchet-shaped\\n deformity.\\nA hatchet is a small axe. This deformity is typical for ankylosing spondylarthritis. Avascular necrosis of the humeral head Hatchet sign versus avascular necrosis The hatchet sign d\\niffers from the deformity seen in avascular necrosis, where there is progressive collapse of the articular surface of the humeral head. Milwaukee shoulder syndrome Milwaukee shoulde\\nrA rare shoulder arthropathy that can simulate the hatchet shoulder is the Milwaukee shoulder syndrome.\\nIt is characterized by rupture of the rotator cuff and large joint and bursal effusions with deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals leading to rapid destruction of the glenohumeral j\\noint.

Ankylosis of the hip joints Ankylosis of the hip joints with joint space narrowing in a patie\\nnt with ankylosing spondylitis. \\nThere is also ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints.\\nPsoriatic arthritis:\\nKey findings\\nErosions and bone proliferation predominantly in a distal distribution, presenting most often as a typical pathognomonical pattern, but sometimes as a confusing subtype (see differe\\nntial diagnosis). ClinicalPsoriatic arthritis is a peripheral type of spondyloarthritis and presents as a peripheral arthritis with or without sacroiliitis and spondylitis.\\nIt frequently is preceded by psoriasis of the skin, but can occur without skin disease in up to 20% of patients.\\nEnthesopathy is common.\\nThe hands are most commonly involved followed by the feet. Other locations are the spine, sacroiliac joints and less frequently knee, elbow, ankle and shoulder.

Notice that the MCP joints are not involved (unlike in RA). Psoriatic art\\nhritis Progressive psoriatic arthritis The distribution and the bone formation makes the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis unlikely. The marginal erosions and the absence of DIP inv\\nolvement in other joints makes the diagnosis of erosive osteoarthritis unlikely, although pencil-in-cup can look like the gullwing deformity in erosive osteoarthritis. Psoriatic art\\nhritis Pencil in cup deformity A. Pencil in cup deformity of 1st and 5th toe. \\nB.

Clinical Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (D\\nISH) is also known as Forestier’s disease. Most often asymptomatic.\\nIt is characterized by bony proliferation at tendinous and ligamentous insertion of the spine and pelvis mostly affecting elderly individuals. Radiological findings Teaching point\\nIn daily practice, it is the classic differential diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, especially in early stages of both diseases. \\nTeach yourself the differences between the two (see below). DISH DISH should not be confused with the findings of a bamboo spine, which is the hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis.

This patient had a minor trauma, which however resulted in an unstable hyperextension fracture with neurological complicati\\nons. Teaching point: you should always have a high suspicion of hyperextension fractures in patients with rigid spine due to DISH and ankylosing spondylitis.\\nGout:\\nKey findings\\nTophi with juxtaarticular erosions at the capsule insertion of a joint, typically MTP1, in patients with risk factors like diabetes and kidney disease Clinical\\nGout\\nis an inflammatory arthropathy caused by the deposition of sodium urate\\ncrystals in joints and periarticular soft tissues and tendons. The first MTP\\njoint is most often affected (podagra). Classically the diagnosis is made\\nclinically, supported by joint aspiration. Radiological findings Late stage of Gout Characteristic radiologic changes in the\\nchronic stage of gout.\\nTypically well-defined “punched-out” eccentric erosions with sclerotic margins in a marginal and juxta-articular distribution.\\nThese erosions have overhanging edges called rat bite erosions.\\nThere is preservation of joint spaces. Periarticular hyperdense soft tissue swelling due to tophi as a result of crystal depositions (pathognomonic). \\nThese are located in the ligamentous structures around the joints.

Clinical Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition (CPPD) is an inflammatory joint disease caused by d\\neposition of calcium\\npyrophosphate dihydrate crystals into the synovial fluid, synovial lining and\\narticular cartilage. Some terms regarding CPPD can be a bit confusing: Radiological findings Two patients with typical CPPD. A. There is cartilage loss in many joints and chondrocal\\ncinosis in: B. This patient had an acute joint inflammation. Chondrocalcinosis in the radiocarpal joint and the TFCC (black arrows) is seen, almost pathognomonical for CPPD. There i\\ns scapholunate dissociation, which can be seen in CPPD, but also in rheumatoid arthritis or posttraumatic. This sudden attack is called pseudogout, because it can simulate the infla\\nmmation and intense pain of a gout attack. Chondrocalcinosis in CPPD There\\nare faint calcifications of the cartilage and meniscus both on the right side\\n(white arrow) as well as on the left side (black arrows). \\nThese can be caused\\nby CPPD, but may be seen in other conditions as well, such as gout or\\nosteoarthritis. Also note the joint space narrowing and mild osteophyte\\nformation. \\nCPPD has many features similar to osteoarthritis. There is a well-circumscribed coarse calcification adjacent to the 4th DIP joint. This does not look like CPPD and scleroderma woul\\nd have been more likely. However, aspiration revealed typical CPPD crystal depositions. As in other arthropathies, atypical presentations of CPPD are possible, but fortunately less \\ncommon.\\nScleroderma:\\nKey findingsSoft tissue calcifications and acro-osteolysis Clinical Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease and\\nis characterized by microvascular obliteration and sclerosis of the skin and\\ninternal organs.\\nThe\\nclinical hallmark of the disease is the appearance of taut tethering of the\\nskin. \\nClinically evident arthritis occurs in up to 65% of patients, and it may\\nbe one of the earliest manifestations of scleroderma. There\\nis a limited and a multisystem variant. CREST syndrome is a common type of limited scleroderma (skin calcinosis,\\nRaynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly\\nand telangiectasia). The systemic variant can affect virtually every organ system or can be\\nlocalized. Radiological findings Soft tissue calcifications Extensive soft tissue calcifications in the distal phalanges in a patient with scleroderma.\\nNotice the calcifications next to the distal ulna (arrow).\\nThere are no signs of cartilage damage. The pathophysiology of the calcium deposits is not well\\nunderstood. \\nIt occurs in tissues that are under chronic stress, such as local\\ntrauma or damage associated with an underlying inflammatory process.\\nIt is usually\\nmore abundant in the dominant hand.\\nWhen these findings are present, the diagnosis is usually straight forward. Subtle, but coarse soft tissue calcifications at the most distal part of the finger in a patient with scl\\neroderma. No acro-osteolysis or other signs are seen. Acro-osteolysis in Scleroderma Severe acro-osteolysis of the finger tips of dig\\n1-3 in a patient with scleroderma (arrows). Notice the lysis of the soft tissues distally. Acro-osteolysis is a\\nradiographic finding which refers to bone destruction of the distal phalanges and occurs in 6–65% of patients with scleroderma. \\nVascular alterations and\\nreduced capillary density impair tissue oxygenation and the resulting hypoxia\\nmay contribute to osteoclast activation. There is a wide variety of diseases that can cause\\nacro-osteolysis including psoriatic arthritis, infection, raynaud disease and thermal trauma. A.

Sonography, CT and MRI all allow direct visualiz\\nation of the normal and thickened gallbladder wall. Traditionally, sonography is used as the initial imaging technique for evaluating patients with suspected gallbladder disease, be\\ncause of its high sensitivity in the detection of gallbladder stones, its real-time character, speed and portability [1]. However, CT has become popular for evaluating the acute abd\\nomen and often is the first modality to detect gallbladder wall thickening [2], or it may be used as an adjunct to an inconclusive sonography or for staging of disease. The potentia\\nl value of MRI in the evaluation of gallbladder pathology has been shown [3], but it still plays little role. LEFT: US of a normal gallbladder after an overnight fast shows the wall\\n as a pencil-thin echogenic line (arrow).RIGHT: US in the postprandial state shows pseudothickening of the gallbladder\\nNormal gallbladder:\\nThe normal gallbladder wall appears as a pencil-thin echogenic line at sonography. The thickness of the gallbladder wall depends on the degree of gallbladder distention and pseudoth\\nickening can occur in the postprandial state. Contrast-enhanced CT shows the normal gallbladder wall as a thin rim of enhancing soft-tissue The normal gallbladder wall is usually pe\\nrceptible at CT as a thin rim of soft-tissue density that enhances after contrast injection. LEFT: US in a 59-year-old woman with acute cholecystitis shows the layered appearance of\\n a thickened gallbladder wall, with a hypoechoic region between echogenic linesRIGHT: At contrast-enhanced CT the thick-walled gallbladder contains a hypodense outer layer (arrow) d\\nue to subserosal oedema\\nThickened gallbladder wall:\\nThickening of the gallbladder wall is a relatively frequent finding at diagnostic imaging studies. A thickened gallbladder wall measures more than 3 mm, typically has a layered appe\\narance at sonography [1], and at CT frequently contains a hypodense layer of subserosal oedema that mimics pericholecystic fluid [2]\\nDifferential diagnosis of gallbladder wall thickening:\\nThe differential diagnosis of gallbladder wall thickening is listed on the left. Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening may produce a diagnostic problem, as it occurs in symptomatic an\\nd asymptomatic patients, and in patients with and without an indication for a cholecystectomy. Diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall may occur in patients who do not have a pri\\nmary gallbladder disease, but in whom the gallbladder is secondarily involved in an extrinsic pathological condition. In these patients a cholecystectomy is unwarranted, and gallbla\\ndder abnormalities will usually return to normal after correction of its extrinsic cause.\\nPrimary gallbladder disease:\\n43-year-old woman with acute calculous cholecystitis. Contrast-enhanced CT shows a distended gallbladder (arrowheads) with a slightly thickened wall and subtle regional fat-strandin\\ng (asterisk). There is an impacted obstructing stone in the neck of the gallbladder (arrow).\\nAcute cholecystitis:\\nAcute cholecystitis is the fourth most common cause of hospital admissions for patients presenting with an acute abdomen [4], and it is the prime diagnostic concern when a thick-wal\\nled gallbladder is found at imaging. \\nThis feature, however, is not pathognomonic for acute cholecystitis. Additional imaging signs that support the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis are: Acute calculous cholec\\nystitis On the left images of a 62-year-old man with acute calculous cholecystitis. Transverse sonogram at the spot of maximum tenderness shows a non-compressible hydropically diste\\nnded thick-walled gallbladder (arrowheads), with an intraluminal stone and sludge or debris. Contrast-enhanced CT depicts extensive fat inflammation (arrowheads) surrounding the\\ngallbladder (arrow). 74-year-old man with acute acalculous cholecystitis. LEFT: US at the spot of maximum tenderness shows mural thickening of the gallbladder (arrow) that is comple\\ntely filled with sludge (asterisk) without any stones. RIGHT: Power-Doppler sonography shows hypervascularity of the gallbladder wall (arrowhead), as a supporting sign of inflammati\\non.\\nAcalculous cholecystitis:\\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis mainly occurs in critically ill patients, presumably due to increased bile viscosity from fasting and medication that causes cholestasis. The imaging \\nfeatures are those of acute cholecystitis, except for the absence of stones whereas gallbladder sludge is usually present (Fig). Because in critically ill patients gallbladder abnor\\nmalities are frequently found secondary to systemic disease (see below), acalculous cholecystitis can be difficult to diagnose [5]. In these patients a percutaneous cholecystostomy \\ncan be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Chronic cholecystitis. Longitudinal sonogram of the gallbladder shows slight wall thickening (arrow) and an intraluminal non-obstructing ston\\ne\\nChronic cholecystitis:\\nChronic cholecystitis is a term used clinically to refer to symptomatic gallbladder stones that cause transient obstruction, leading to a low-grade inflammation with fibrosis [1]. C\\norrelation of the imaging finding of a stone-containing slightly thick-walled gallbladder with the clinical history is critical. On the left images of a 49-year-old woman with chron\\nic cholecystitis. This patient had fasted overnight, so the wall-thickening does not represent physiologic contraction. Correlation of these findings with her clinical history of re\\ncurrent colic-like right upper quadrant pain, due to transient gallbladder obstruction, is essential for the diagnosis. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. LEFT: US shows marked wall\\n thickening with intramural hypoechoic nodules (arrowheads), and an intraluminal stone (arrow).RIGHT: Contrast-enhanced CT shows a deformed and thickened gallbladder wall containing\\n hypoattenuating nodules\\nXanthogranulomatous cholecystitis:\\nXanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is an unusual variant of chronic cholecystitis, characterized by a lipid-laden inflammatory process comparable to xanthogranulomatous pyelonephriti\\ns. Imaging studies show marked gallbladder wall thickening, often containing intramural nodules that are hypoechoic at sonography and hypoattenuating at CT, representing abscesses o\\nr foci of xanthogranulomatous inflammation. These features overlap with those of gallbladder carcinoma, making preoperative distinction between these entities often impossible [6]. \\nXanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Hypoattenuating nodules ( arrowheads) represent abscesses. The lumen contains several stones (arrow). On the left a 71-year-old man with xanthogra\\nnulomatous cholecystitis.

              " Document(page_content=\"Gallbladder carcinoma:\\nGallbladder carcinoma is the fifth most common malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract, and is found incidentally in 1% to 3% of cholecystectomy specimens [4]. It is often detected\\n at a late stage of the disease, due to lack of early or specific symptoms. Gallbladder carcinoma has various imaging appearances, ranging from a polypoid intra-luminal lesion to an\\n infiltrating mass replacing the gallbladder, and it may also present as diffuse mural thickening. Associated findings such as invasion of adjacent structures, secondary bile duct d\\nilatation, and liver or nodal metastases may help in differentiating a carcinoma from acute or xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis [2, 4]. In absence of these associated findings, it \\nmay not be possible to differentiate a carcinoma from xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Adenomyomatosis in a 39-year-old woman. US shows mural thickening with calcifications with t\\nhe characteristic 'comet-tail' reverberation artifact (arrow) due to small cholesterol crystals within Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses.\\nAdenomyomatosis:\\nAdenomyomatosis of the gallbladder is characterized by epithelial proliferation, muscular hypertrophia and intramural diverticula (Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses), which may segmentally\\n or diffusely involve of the gallbladder. It is a benign condition that requires no specific treatment, occurring as an incidental finding in up to 9% of cholecystectomy specimens [\\n6]. The sonographic finding of cholesterol crystals, shown as 'comet-tail'\\nreverberation artifacts (Fig), within a thickened wall of the gallbladder strongly suggests this diagnosis. Air may produce a similar artifact, however, patients with emphysematous \\ncholecystitis are usually ill in contrast to those with adenomyomatosis. MR imaging may be able to differentiate adenomyomatosis from gallbladder carcinoma by depicting Rokitansky-A\\nschoff sinuses [7].\\nSecondary gallbladder involvement:\\n56-year-old man with liver cirrhosisLEFT: US depicts wall thickening (arrow), surrounded by ascites. Note the irregular cirrhotic liver parenchyma. RIGHT: At contrast-enhanced CT th\\ne wall of the gallbladder (arrow) appears nearly normal, because subserosal oedema can not be well differentiated from surrounding ascites at CT.\\nLiver cirrhosis:\\nSystemic diseases such as hepatic dysfunction, heart failure, or renal failure may lead to diffuse gallbladder thickening [1, 2]. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism leading to oed\\nema of the gallbladder wall in these diverse conditions is uncertain, but it is likely due to elevated portal venous pressure, elevated systemic venous pressure, decreased intravasc\\nular osmotic pressure, or a combination of these factors. Hypoproteinemia has also been reported as a cause of extrinsic gallbladder disease, but this has been disputed [8]. Liver c\\nirrhosis, hepatitis and congestive right heart failure are relatively frequent causes.\\nThe case on the left is a patient with liver cirrhosis. The secondary gallbladder wall thickening is presumably due to elevated portal venous pressure and decreased intravascular os\\nmotic pressure. Drug-induced hepatitis with diffuse gallbladder wall thickening\\nHepatitis:\\nOn the left a 75-year-old man with drug-induced hepatitis. Longitudinal sonogram of a non-distended gallbladder shows diffuse wall thickening (arrow), and incidental cholelithiasis \\nwhich may be confusing. Drug-induced hepatitis. In the same patient with the drug-induced hepatitis MR images were obtained to evaluate the bile ducts because of abnormal liver func\\ntion tests. On the far left Axial SPIR T2-weighted image (A) shows a small amount of ascites (arrowhead) which indicates that the thickened gallbladder wall (arrow) probably has an \\nextrinsic systemic cause.

Pancreatitis in a 56-year-old man Contrast-enhanced CT shows peripancreatic inflammatory changes (a\\nrrowheads), and thickening of the wall of the gallbladder (arrow) which is secondarily involved in the pancreatic inflammation.\\nPancreatitis:\\nExtracholecystic inflammation may secondarily involve the gallbladder causing wall thickening, due to direct spread of the primary inflammation, or less frequently due to an immunol\\nogic reaction [8]. Theoretically, it may be caused by any inflammation that extends to the region of the gallbladder, but only few are regularly encountered including hepatitis, pan\\ncreatitis (Figure), and pyelonephritis. Gallbladder wall thickening has also been reported in patients with infectious mononucleosis [9], and in patients with AIDS due to opportunis\\ntic infections or secondary neoplastic infiltration [2].\\nConclusion:\\nAll the profits of the Radiology Assistant go to Medical Action Myanmar which is run by Dr. Nini Tun and Dr. Frank Smithuis sr, who is a professor at Oxford university and happens t\\no be the brother of Robin Smithuis.

              " Document(page_content='Craniosynostosis refers to the premature closure of sutures of the skull and results in an abnormal head shape. \\nIt is a rare disorder with a prevalence of around 1 in 1500. \\nMost cases occur already prenatally and will be diagnosed in the first few months of life.\\nIt may also be diagnosed intrauterine, but antenatal imaging is beyond the scope of this article.\\nIntroduction:\\nNormal skull:\\nIn the first few years of life the brain grows fast and the skull grows along with it.\\nThis requires open sutures for enchondral growth.\\nAt 1 year of age around 65% of skull growth is accomplished, with the growth rate thereafter slowing down, and reaching around 90% at 5 years of age. Most craniosynostoses are the r\\nesult of an intrinsic defect in the suture.\\nCraniosynostosis may be part of a syndrome and in those cases the craniosynostosis is often multi-sutural and there may be other anomalies (cardiac, kidney and skeletal).\\nClinical evaluation:\\nIn the past decades there has been an increase in the number of children seeking medical attention because of an abnormal head shape, which is now reported as high as 1 in 5. Most c\\nases are a positional plagiocephaly rather than a real craniosynostosis. This is often related to the advice of sleeping on the back to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. A well-\\ntrained clinician will often be able to recognize the typical presentation of a positional plagiocephaly and distinguish from its main differential diagnosis of a unilateral lambdoi\\nd stenosis (see below). \\nThe parents may then be reassured because the condition is self-limiting and with adequate advice usually reversible. In case of a clinical high suspicion of a craniosynostosis time\\nly reference to a specialized center may be advisable before diagnostic imaging is started (figure).\\nOverview craniosynostoses:\\nUnisutural and Bicoronal:\\nIn craniosynostosis the skull deformity is present from birth and will be progressive.\\nTimely diagnosis is important, as earlier treatment leads to a better outcome. In unisutural and bicoronal craniosynostosis a specific head shape may be expected, depending on the i\\nnvolved suture.\\nThis is depicted in the illustration. In multisutural involvement the changes are more complex and cannot easily be predicted.\\nPlagiocephaly:\\nIn plagiocephaly, also known as flat head syndrome, there is an asymmetrical flattening of one side of the skull.\\nA mild and widespread form of plagiocephaly is caused by remaining in a supine position for prolonged periods, as discussed above.\\nThis is called deformational plagiocephaly. There is no synostosis and all the sutures are open. The synostotic form of plagiocephaly can be on the anterior side due to unicoronal c\\nlosure or on the posterior side due to closure of a lambdoid suture on one side.\\nImaging:\\nWhen a craniosynostosis is suspected, the first line imaging will be ultrasound or x-rays, depending on local expertise and preferences. Because of lack of radiation, ultrasound is \\n the preferred method. \\nIn case of high clinical suspicion low dose 3D CT is preferred. The figure shows the US of a normal suture, an unilateral coronal stenosis and a\\nsagittal stenosis with ridge. Skull radiographs\\ndemonstrating open sutures. Be\\naware that radiographs have a limited value for assessment of the sagittal\\nsuture and a partial closure of the sagittal suture may be overlooked.\\n3D CT:\\nThe images show open\\nsutures in a child with a physiologically closed metopic suture (arrow).

Typically, the entire side is pushed forward, hence the ear will be seen more anterior than on the con\\ntralateral side (arrow). This is in contradiction to a posterior plagiocephaly resulting from a unilateral lambdoid suture stenosis, where\\nthe mastoid and the ear are pulled down and drawn back. The drawing illustrates the differences. In positional\\nplagiocephaly the form of the head resembles a parallelogram. In unilateral\\nlambdoid stenosis the form of the head resembles a trapezium, because one side of the head is restricted in its growth. Here the same illustration with now all the differences betwe\\nen deformational and lambdoid plagiocephaly.

In fact every radiologst should be an expert in chest film re\\nading. The interpretation of a chest film requires the understanding of basic principles. In this article we will focus on: Pathology of the heart, mediastinum, lungs and pleura, ch\\nest wall and abdomen. Normal and Variants\\nNormal and Variants:\\nPA view:\\nOn the PA chest-film it is important to examine all the areas where the lung borders the diaphragm, the heart and other mediastinal structures. At these borders lung-soft tissue int\\nerfaces are seen resulting in a: These lines and silhouettes are useful localizers of disease, because they can be displaced or obscured with loss of the normal silhouette. This is \\ncalled the silhouette sign, which we will discuss later. The paraspinal line may be displaced by a paravertebral abscess, hemorrhage due to a fracture or extravertebral extension of\\n a neoplasm. Widening of the paratracheal line (> 2-3mm) may be due to lymphadenopathy, pleural thickening, hemorrhage or fluid overload and heart failure. Displacement of the para-\\naortic line can be due to elongation of the aorta, aneurysm, dissection and rupture. The anterior and posterior junction lines are formed where the upper lobes join anteriorly and p\\nosteriorly. These are usely not well seen and we will not discuss them. An important mediastinal-lung interface to look for is the azygoesophageal line or recess (arrow).\\nAzygo-esophageal recess:\\nThe azygo-esophageal recess is the region inferior to the level of the azygos vein arch in which the right lung forms an interface with the mediastinum between the heart anteriorly \\nand vertebral column posteriorly. It is bordered on the left side by the esophagus. Deviation of the azygoesophageal line is caused by: Notice the deviation of the azygoesophageal l\\nine on the PA-film. It is caused by a hiatal hernia.\\nThe arrow point to the barium contrast within the hiatal hernia.\\nVena azygos lobe:\\nA common normal variant is the azygos lobe. The azygos lobe is created when a laterally displaced azygos vein makes a deep fissure in the upper part of the lung. On a chest film it \\nis seen as a fine line that crosses the apex of the right lung. Here another patient with an azygos lobe. The azygos vein is seen as a thick structure within the azygos fissure. In \\nsome patients an extra joint is seen in the anterior part of the first rib at the point where the bone meets the calcified cartilageneous part (arrow). This may simulate a lung mass\\n.\\nPectus excavatum:\\nIn patients with a pectus excavatum the right heart border can be ill-defined, but this is normal. It produces a silhouette sign and thus simulating a consolidation or atelectasis o\\nf the right middle lobe. The lateral view is helpful in such cases. Pectus excavatum is a congenital deformity of the ribs and the sternum producing a concave appearance of the ante\\nrior chest wall.\\nLateral view:\\nOn a normal lateral view the contours of the heart are visible and the IVC is seen entering the right atrium. The retrosternal space contains air and should be radiolucent down to t\\nhe level where the right ventricle borders the sternum (small black arrow). \\nAny radiopacity in this upper retrosternal area is suspective of a process in the anterior mediastinum or upper lobes of the lungs. As you go from superior to inferior over the vert\\nebral bodies they should get darker, because usually there will be less soft tissue and more radiolucent lung tissue (white arrow). If this area becomes more dense, look carefully f\\nor pathology in the lower lobes. Diaphragm The contours of the left and right diaphragm should be visible. The right diaphragm should be visible all the way to the anterior chest wa\\nll (red arrow). Actually we see the interface between the air in the lungs and the soft tissue structures in the abdomen. The left diaphragm can only be seen to a point where it bor\\nders the heart (blue arrow). At that point the interface is lost, since the heart has the same density as the structures below the diaphragm. Pulmonary vessels The left main pulmona\\nry artery (in purple) passes over the left main bronchus and is higher than the right pulmonary artery (in blue) which passes in front of the right main bronchus. Once you know how \\nthe normal hilar structures look like on a lateral view, it is easier to detect abnormalities. In this case on the PA-view there is hilar enlargement. On the PA-view it is not clear\\n whether this is due to dilated vessels or enlarged lymph nodes. On the lateral view there are round structures in areas where you don't expect any vessels. So we can conclude that \\nwe are dealing with enlarged lymph nodes. This patient has sarcoidosis. Notice also the widening of the paratracheal line (or stripe) as a result of enlarged lymph nodes. On the lat\\neral view spondylosis may mimick a lung mass. Any density in the area of the vertebral bodies should lead you to the PA-film to look for spondylosis, which is usually located on the\\n right side (arrows). On the left side the formation of osteophytes is hampered by the pulsations of the aorta. On the PA-view the superior mediastinum is widened. The lateral view \\nis helpful in this case because it demonstrates a density in the upper retrosternal space. Now the differential diagnosis is limited to a mass in the anterior mediastinum (4 T's). T\\nhis was a Hodgkins lymphoma. A common incidental finding in adults is a Bochdalek hernia, which is due to a congenital defect in the posterior diaphragm (arrows). In most cases it o\\nnly contains retroperitoneal fat and is asymptomatic, but occasionally it may contain abdominal organs. Large hernias are sometimes seen in neonates and can be complicated by pulmon\\nary hypoplasia. A hernia of Morgagni is also a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but is less common. It is located anteriorly.\\nSystematic Approach:\\nWhenever you review a chest x-ray, always use a systematic approach. We use an inside-out approach from central to peripheral. First the heart figure is evaluated, followed by media\\nstinum and hili. Subsequently the lungs, lungborders and finally the chest wall and abdomen are examined. You have to know the normal anatomy and variants. Find subtle abnormalities\\n by using the sihouette sign and mediastinal lines. Once you see an abnormality use a pattern approach to come up with the most likely diagnosis and differential diagnosis.\\nOld films:\\nIt is extremely important to always compare with old films, as we will demonstrate in this case. Actually someone said that the most important radiograph is the old film, since it g\\nives you so much information. For instance a lung mass, which hasn't changed in many years is not a lung cancer. First study the chest films.\\nBased on these films, you could make the diagnosis of congestive heart failure, but the findings are subtle. Continue with the old film... Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll back and forth to the old film.\\nOnce you compare the chest film to the old one, things become more obvious and you will be much more confident in your diagnosis of congestive heart failure: 1.

Silhouette sign in a consolidation in the lingula lobe (yellow arrow).\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 244}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Silhouette sign:\\nThe loss of the normal silhouette of a structure is called the silhouette sign.This is an important sign, because it enables us to find subtle pathology and to locate it within the \\nchest. Here an illustration to explain the silhouette sign: Silhouette sign (2) The PA-film shows a silhouette sign of the left heart border. Even without looking at the lateral fil\\nm, we know, that the pathology must be located anteriorly in the left lung. This was a consolidation due to a pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Silhouette sign (3) Here \\na consolidation which is located in the left lower lobe (yellow arrow).\\nNotice that there is a normal silhouette of the left heart border (blue arrow). The absence of a silhouette sign tells us that the pathology is located in the left lower lobe and no\\nt in the lingula. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Silhouette sign (4) On this lateral film there is too much density over the lower part of the spine.\\nFirst study the lateral film and decide on which side the pathology is located. Then click on the image to enlarge and scroll through the images. By only looking at the interfaces o\\nf the left and right diaphragm on the lateral film, it is possible to tell on which side the pathology is located. In this case we cannot follow the contour of the right diaphragm a\\nll the way to posterior, which indicates that there is something of water-density in the right lower lobe. Continue with the PA-film of the same patient... On the PA-film there is a\\n normal silhouette of the right heart border, so the pathology is not in the anterior part of the chest, which we already had decided by studying the lateral view. Question:\\nWhy do we still see the silhouette of the right diaphragm on the PA-film? Answer:\\nWhat we see is actually the highest point of the right diaphragm, which is anterior to the pneumonia in the right lower lobe. The pneumonia does not border the highest point of the \\nright diaphragm and there will be no silhouette sign.\\nHidden areas:\\nThere are some areas that need special attention, because pathology in these areas can easily be overlooked. These areas are also known as the hidden areas: Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Notice that there is quite some lung volume below the dome of the diaphragm, which will need your attention (blue area). Hidden areas (2) Here an example of a large l\\nesion in the right lower lobe, which is difficult to detect on the PA-film, unless when you give special attention to the hidden areas. Click on the image for an enlarged view. Hidd\\nen areas (3) Here a pneumonia which was hidden in the right lower lobe mainly below the level of the dome of the diaphragm (yellow arrow). Notice the increase in density on the late\\nral film in the lower vertebral region. You may have to enlarge the image to get a better view. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Hidden areas (4) First study the CXR.\\nThen scroll through the images. Notice the subtle increased density in the area behind the heart that needs special attention (blue area). This was a left lower lobe pneumonia. Firs\\nt study the CXR. We know that in some cases there is an extra joint in the anterior part of the first rib which may simulate a mass. However this is also a hidden area where it can \\nbe difficult to detect a mass. In this case a small lung cancer is seen behind the left first rib. Notice that is is also seen on the lateral view in the retrosternal area. Continue\\n with the PET-CT. The PET-CT demonstrates the tumor (arrow) which has already spread to the bone and liver. The diagnosis was made by a biopsy of an osteeolytic metastasis in the il\\niac bone. First study the CXRs. There is a subtle consolidation in the left lower lobe in the hidden area behind the heart. Again there is increased density over the lower vertrebra\\nl region.\\nHeart and Pericardium:\\nOn a chest film only the outer contours of the heart are seen. In many cases we can only tell whether the heart figure is normal or enlarged and it will be difficult to say anything\\n about the different heart compartments. However it can be helpful to know where the different compartments are situated. Left Atrium Right Atrium Left Ventricle Right Ventricle Lef\\nt Atrium Left Ventricle Right Ventricle Left Atrium enlargementThis is a patient with longstanding mitral valve disease and mitral valve replacement. Extreme dilatation of the left \\natrium has resulted in bulging of the contours (blue and black arrows). Right ventricle enlargementFirst study the PA and lateral chest film and then continue reading. On these ches\\nt films the heart is extremely dilated. Notice that it is especially the right ventricle that is dilated. This is well seen on the lateral film (yellow arrow). There is a small aort\\nic knob (blue arrow), while the pulmonary trunk and the right lower pulmonary artery are dilated. All these findings are probably the result of a left-to-right shunt with subsequent\\n development of pulmonary hypertension. The location of the cardiac valves is best determined on the lateral radiograph. A line is drawn on the lateral radiograph from the carina to\\n the cardiac apex. The pulmonic and aortic valves generally sit above this line and the tricuspid and mitral valves sit below this line (4). On this lateral view you can get a good \\nimpression of the enlargement of the left atrium.\\nCardiac incisura:\\nClick image to enlarge. On the right side of the chest the lung will lie against the anterior chest wall. On the left however the inferior part of the lung may not reach the anterio\\nr chest wall, since the heart or pericardial fat or effusion is situated there. This causes a density on the anteroinferior side on the lateral view which can have many forms. It is\\n a normal finding, which can be seen on many chest x-rays and should not be mistaken for pathology in the lingula or middle lobe. The explanation for the cardiac incisura is seen on\\n this CT-image. At the level of the inferior part of the heart we can appreciate that the lower lobe of the right lung is seen more anteriorly compared to the left lower lobe. Pacem\\naker There are different types of cardiac pacemakers. Here we see a pacemaker with one lead in the right atrium and another in the right ventricle. A third lead is seen, which is gu\\nided through the coronary sinus towards the left ventricle. This is done in patients with asynchrone ventricular contractions. Pacing both ventricles at the same time will lead to s\\nynchrone contractions and a better cardiac output. More on cardiac pacemakers...\\nPericardial effusion:\\nWhenever we encounter a large heart figure, we should always be aware of the possibility of pericardial effusion simulating a large heart. On the chest x-ray it looks as if this pat\\nient has a dilated heart while on the CT it is clear, that it is the pericardial effusion that is responsible for the enlarged heart figure. Especially in patients who had recent ca\\nrdiac surgery an enlargement of the heart figure can indicate pericardial bleeding. This patient had a change in the heart configuration and pericardial bleeding was suspected. Ultr\\nasound demonstrated only a minimal pericardial effusion. Continue with the CT. There is a large pericardial effusion, which is located posteriorly to the left ventricle (blue arrow)\\n. The left ventricle id filled with contrast and is compressed (red arrow). At surgery a large hematoma in the posterior part of the pericardium was found. Notice that on the anteri\\nor side there is only a minimal collection of pericardial fluid, which explains why the ultrasound examination underestimated the amount of pericardial fluid. Here another patient w\\nho had valve-replacement. Notice the large heart size. There is redistribution of the pulmonary vessels which indicates heart failure. Continue with the CT. The CT-image shows a lar\\nge pericardial effusion. Always compare these post-operative chest films with the pre-operative ones.\\nCalcifications:\\nDetection of calcifications within the heart is quite common. The most common are coronary artery calcifications and valve calcifications. Here we see pericardial calcifications whi\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 245}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"ch can be associated with constrictive pericarditis. In this case there are calcifications that look like pericardial calcifications, but these are myocardial calcifications in an i\\nnfarcted area of the left ventricle. Notice that they follow the contour of the left ventricle.\\nPericardial fatpad:\\nPericardial fat depositions are common. Sometimes a large fat pad can be seen (figure). Necrosis of the fat pad has pathologic features similar to fat necrosis in epiploic appendagi\\ntis. It is an uncommon benign condition, that manifests as acute pleuritic chest pain in previously healthy persons (10).\\nPericardial cyst:\\nPericardial cysts are connected to the pericardium and usually contain clear fluid. The majority of pericardial cysts arise in the anterior cardiophrenic angle, more frequently on t\\nhe rightside, but they can be seen as high as the pericardial recesses at the level of the proximal aorta and pulmonary arteries (11). Most patients are asymptomatic. On the chest x\\n-ray it seems as if there is a elevated left hemidiaphragm. On CT however there is a cyst connected to the pericardium.\\nHili:\\nThe normal hilar shadow is for 99% composed of vessels - pulmonary arteries and to a lesser extent veins (1). The vessel margins are smooth and the vessels have branches. The left h\\nilum should never be lower than the right hilum. The left pulmonary artery runs over the left main bronchus, while the right pulmonary artery runs in front of the right main bronchu\\ns, which is usually lower in position than the left main bronchus. Hence the left hilum is higher than the right. Only in a minority of cases the right hilus is at the same level as\\n the left, but never higher. In this illustration the lower lobe arteries are coloured blue because they contain oxygen-poor blood. They have a more vertical orientation, while the \\npulmonary veins run more horizontally towards the left atrium, which is located below the level of the main pulmonary arteries. Both pulmonary arteries and veins can be identified o\\nn a lateral view and should not be mistaken for lymphadenopathy. Sometimes the pulmonary veins can be very prominent. The left main pulmonary artery passes over the left main bronch\\nus and is higher than the right pulmonary artery which passes in front of the right main bronchus. These images are thick slab sagittal reconstructions of a chest-ct to get a better\\n view of the hilar structures. The lower lobe pulmonary arteries extend inferiorly from the hilum. They are described as little fingers, because each has the size of a little finger\\n (1). On the right side the little finger will be visible in 94% of normal CXRs and on the left side in 62% of normals (1). Study the CXR of a 70-year old male who fell from the sta\\nirs and has severe pain on the right flank.. Notice on the PA-film the absence of the little finger on the right and on the lateral view the increased density over the lower vertebr\\nal column. What is your diagnosis? There is a right lower lobe atelectasis. Notice the abnormal right border of the heart. The right interlobar artery is not visible, because it is \\nnot surrounded by aerated lung but by the collapsed lower lobe, which is adjacent to the right atrium. On a follow-up chest film the atelectasis has resolved. We assume that the ate\\nlectasis was a result of post-traumatic poor ventilation with mucus plugging. Notice the reappearance of the right little finger (red arrow) and the normal right heart border (blue \\narrow).\\nHilar enlargement:\\nThe table summarizes the causes of hilar enlargement. Normal hili are: Enlargement of the hili is usually due to lymphadenopathy or enlarged vessels. In this case there is an enlarg\\ned hilar shadow on both sides. This could be the result of enlarged vessels or enlarged lymph nodes. A very helpful finding in this case is the mass on the right of the trachea. Thi\\ns is known as the 1-2-3 sign in sarcoidosis, i.e. enlargement of left hilum, right hilum and paratracheal. Here some more examples of sarcoidosis. Click to enlarge.\\nMediastinum:\\nMediastinal masses are discussed in more detail in Mediastinal masses. Here is just a brief overview. The mediastinum can be divided into an anterior, middle and posterior compartme\\nnt, each with it's own pathology.\\nMediastinal lines:\\nMediastinal lines or stripes are interfaces between the soft tissue of mediastinal structures and the lung. Displacement of these lines is helpful in finding mediastinal pathology, \\nas we have discussed above.\\nAzygoesophageal recess:\\nThe most important mediastinal line to look for is the azygoesophageal line, which borders the azygoesophageal recess. This line is visible on most frontal CXRs. The causes of displ\\nacement of this line are summarized in the table. A hiatal hernia is the most common cause of displacement of the azygoesophageal line. Notice the air within the hernia on the later\\nal view. Another common cause of displacement of the azygoesophageal line is subcarinal lymphadenopathy. Notice the displacement of the upper part of the azygoesophageal line on the\\n chest x-ray in the area below the carina. This is the result of massive lymphadenopathy in the subcarinal region (station 7). There are also nodes on the right of the trachea displ\\nacing the right paratracheal line. On the PET we can appreciate the massive lymphadenopathy far better than on the CXR. There are also lymphomas in the neck. this is an important fi\\nnding, since these nodes are accessible for biopsy. Continue with images of CT and ultrasound. Here we see a CT-image. The azygoesophageal recess is displaced by lymph nodes that co\\nmpress the left atrium. The final diagnosis of small cel lungcancer was made through a biopsy of a lymphnode in the neck. First study the chest x-ray. Then continue reading. Notice \\nthe following: Combined with the above this must be a dilated esophagus with residual fluid. The final diagnosis was achalasia.\\n3. The density on the left in the region of the lingula is the result from prior aspiration pneumonia. Here we have a prior CXR of this patient. The AP-film shows a right paratrache\\nal mass. The azygoesophageal recess is not identified, because it is displaced and parallels the border of the right atrium. The large round density in the left lung is the result o\\nf aspiration. Notice the massive dilatation of the esophagus on the CT.\\nAortopulmonary window:\\nThe aortopulmonary window is the interface below the aorta and above the pulmonary trunk and is concave or straight laterally. Here the AP-window is convex laterally due to a mass t\\nhat fills the retrosternal space on the lateral view. On the CT-images a mass in the anterior mediastinum is seen. Final diagnosis: Hodgkins lymphoma. Here another case. On the PA-f\\nilm a mass is seen that fills the aortopulmonary window. The PET better demonstrates the extent of the lymphnode metastases in this patient. Final diagnosis: small cell lungcarcinom\\na.\\nLungs:\\nLung abnormalities mostly present as areas of increased density, which can be divided into the following patterns: Less frequently areas of decreased density are seen as in emphysem\\na or lungcysts. These lungpatterns will discussed in more detail in an article that will be published soon: Chest X-Ray - Lung disease.

              " Document(page_content=\"Pleural fluid:\\nIt takes about 200-300 ml of fluid before it comes visible on an CXR (figure). About 5 liters of pleural fluid are present when there is total opacification of the hemithorax. Total\\n opacification of the right hemithorax in a patient with pleuritis carcinomatosa on both sides. On the right there is only some air visible in the major bronchi creating an air bron\\nchogram within the compressed lung. Pleural fluid may become encysted. Here we see fluid entrapped within the fissure. This can sometimes give the impression of a mass and is called\\n 'vanishing tumor'.\\nPneumothorax:\\nThe table lists the most common causes of a pneumothorax. The other cystic lungdisease which causes pneumothorax is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) which is seen in smokers. Stu\\ndy the CXR. There are two important findings. The retracted visceral pleura is seen (blue arrow) which indicates that there is a pneumothorax. There is a horizontal line visible (ye\\nllow arrow). Normally there are no straight lines in the human body unless when there is an air-fluid level. This means that there is a hydro-pneumothorax. When a pneumothorax is sm\\nall, this air-fluid level can be the only key to the diagnosis of a pneumothorax. Study the CXR. There are 3 important findings. Notice that the mediastinum is slightly displaced to\\n the left. Does this mean that there is a tension pneumothorax? Do you have an idea about the cause of the pneumothorax? There is a hydropneumothorax. Notice the air-fluid level (bl\\nue arrow). The upper lobe is still attached to the chest wall by adhesions. Maybe this patient was treated for a prior pneumothorax. There is a lung cyst in the upper lobe (red arro\\nw). So we can assume that the pneumothorax has something to do with a cystic lung disease. Since this patient is a woman, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a possible diagnosis. LAM\\n is a rare lung disease that results in a proliferation of smooth muscle throughout the lungs resulting in the obstruction of small airways leading to pulmonary cyst formation and p\\nneumothorax. LAM also occurs in patients who have tuberous sclerosis. Study the CXR. What is your diagnosis? This is not a pneumothorax but a skin fold. The radiography was performe\\nd supine with a CR cassette inserted underneath the patient, which resulted in a skinfold. Notice that there are lung markings beyond the apparent pneumothorax. Here two CXRs of ano\\nther patient with obvious skinfolds. Recognition of a pneumothorax depends on the volume of air in the pleural space and the position of the body. On a supine radiograph a pneumotho\\nrax can be subtle and approximately 30% of pneumothoraces are undetected. A sign to look for is the 'deep sulcus sign'. It represents lucency of the lateral costophrenic angle exten\\nding toward the hypochondrium (Figure). The image is of a patient in the ICU who is on mechanical ventilation. There was an acute exacerbation of the dyspnoe. There is a deep sulcus\\n sign on the left. Notice that the left hemidiaphragm is depressed. This is an important finding since it indicates a tension pneumothorax. The image on the right is after insertion\\n of an intercostal drain. Notice that the diaphragm has regained its normal appearance.\\nPleural opacities:\\nThe table lists the most common causes of pleural opacities. Pleural plaquesThe CXR shows multiple opacities. They have irregular shapes and do not look like a lung masses or consol\\nidations. Some of these opacities are clearly bordering the chest wall (red arrows). All these findings indicate that we are dealing asbestos related pleural plaques. Asbestos relat\\ned pleural plaques are usually: Unilateral pleural calcifications are usually due to: Pleural hematoma These images are of a patient, who had a pleural opacity after a chest trauma.\\n It was believed to be a hematoma and resolved spontaneously.\\nChest wall:\\nRibfracturesThe most common identified chest wall abnormalities are old ribfractures. The CXR shows many rib deformities due to old fracturees. When a rib fracture heals, the callus\\n formation may create a mass-like appearance (blue arrow). Sometimes a CT is necessary to differentiate a healing fracture from a lung mass. Notice the large lung volume and the enl\\narged pulmonary vessels. Probably we are dealing with pulmonary arterial hypertension in a patient with COPD. The second most common chest wall abnormalities that we see on a CXR ar\\ne metastases in vertebral bodies and ribs. Notice the expansile mass in the posterior rib on the right.\\nAbdomen:\\nThe most obvious finding on this CXR is free air under the diaphragm. This finding indicates a bowel perforation, unless when the patient had recent abdominal surgery and there is s\\ntill some air left in the abdomen, which can stay there for several days. There is another subtle finding in the left upper lobe. A subtle density projecting over the first rib - hi\\ndden area - proved to be a lungcarcinoma. Here another patient with free abdominal air. Notice the very thin regular line which is the diaphragm (arrow). At first impression one mig\\nht think that this is just some plate-like atelectasis due to poor inspiration. by Gerald de Lacey et al.\\n2. introduction to chest radiology Introduction to chest radiology\\n3.

Horner\\nsyndrome can be anatomically classified into three types depending on where the\\noculosympathetic pathway is interrupted: Clinically it can be difficult to\\ndifferentiate a central Horner from a pre- or postganglionic Horner.\\nPharmacological testing of the eyes\\nwith Apraclonidine or Cocaine can help make the diagnosis.\\nThis means that in patients with a\\nunilateral Horner all these levels need to be examined unless other symptoms\\npoint to a specific anatomical area.\\nOnly in patients with a bilateral\\nHorner we can assume, that the pathology is located in the central neuron. Horner syndrome classically presents with: Interruption of oculosympathetic pathways leads to inactivation\\n of the superior tarsal muscle resulting in ptosis and inactivation of the dilator muscle  producing a miosis. \\nThe ptosis of Horner syndrome may be subtle, often 2 mm or less and has to be distinguished from the severe ptosis in oculomotor (CN III) palsy which supplies the levator palpebrae \\nsuperior and is accompanied by a dilated pupil due to a loss of innervation to the sphincter pupillae. Pre- and postganglionic causes of Horner syndrome are as common.\\nCentral Horner syndrome is  uncommon.\\nClinically frequently the central Horner syndrome goes unnoticed, because the other symptoms of brain pathology dominate the clinical picture.\\nCentral - 1st order neuron:\\nThe most common cause of a central Horner is infarction of the posterior-inferior cerebellar artery or\\nof the distal vertebral artery territory and is part of the\\nlateral medullary syndrome.

It is the leading cause of death in this category of diseases, frequently presen\\nting as a complex cystic mass. The finding of an adnexal cyst causes considerable anxiety in women due to the fear of malignancy. However, the vast majority of adnexal cysts - even \\nin postmenopausal women - are benign. In this article we will focus on specific features of ovarian cysts that are helpful in making a differential diagnosis. We will present a road\\nmap for the diagnostic work-up and management of ovarian cystic masses, based on ultrasound and MRI findings. In Ovarian Cystic Masses II the imaging features of normal ovaries and \\nthe most common ovarian cystic masses will be presented, as well as several less common cystic lesions.\\nDiagnostic work-up:\\nIf a cystic pelvic mass is present, the first step is to find out if it is ovarian or non-ovarian in origin.\\n* Step 2 The next step is to determine if the lesion can be categorized as one of the common, benign ovarian masses (simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or mature cystic ter\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 251}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"atoma), or is indeterminate.\\n* Step 3 To aid in selecting the proper work-up, the final step is to determine whether a patient falls into a low-risk category (i.e. premenopausal women without additional risk fa\\nctors) or a high-risk category (i.e. post-menopausal or premenopausal with additional risk factors). Based on these steps we can determine further management: ignore, follow-up with\\n US, further evaluation with MRI or excision.\\nRole of imaging:\\nRole of Ultrasound For characterization of ovarian masses, ultrasound is often the first-line method of choice, especially for distinguishing cystic from complex cystic-solid and so\\nlid lesions. Role of CT CT is useful for the N- and M-staging of proven malignant lesions. Role of MRI For complex lesions, primary evaluation with ultrasound is often followed by f\\nurther evaluation with MRI. Even with MRI it is often not possible to make an accurate diagnosis of neoplastic subtype. By using MRI as an adjunct to sonography a delay in the treat\\nment of potentially malignant ovarian lesions is prevented. This is not only beneficial to the small number of women who do have ovarian cancer, but also a proven cost-effective app\\nroach to the management of sonographically indeterminate adnexal lesions.\\nOvarian or non-ovarian:\\nIf a cystic adnexal mass is present and you suspect an ovarian origin, the first thing to do is try to identify the ovaries. If the gonadal vessels lead to the lesion with no separa\\ntely identifiable normal ovaries, then most likely you are dealing with an ovarian lesion. If both ovaries are separately identifiable from the lesion, you are dealing with a non-ov\\narian cystic lesion, or a lesion that mimics a cystic mass. The next step would be to check if there is uni- or bilateral disease and to look for any solid components that may indic\\nate malignancy. Also look for secondary findings like ascites, enlarged lymph nodes and peritoneal deposits. The table shows a differential diagnosis for possible cystic ovarian mas\\nses. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images A helpful tool to identify the ovaries is to follow the ovarian veins caudally. Scroll through the CT-images and follow the right ovarian ve\\nin from where it joins the inferior vena cava, and the left ovarian vein where it joins the left renal vein, until you identify the ovaries.\\nUltrasound pattern recognition:\\nPattern recognition on ultrasound often allows a fairly confident diagnosis of common cystic ovarian masses. This means that in many cases the diagnostic work-up is based on determi\\nning the probability that we are dealing with a lesion which falls into the category of a simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or a mature cystic teratoma (commonly referred \\nto as a dermoid cyst). Most other cystic lesions are indeterminate and therefore possibly malignant. These therefore require further evaluation, either with MRI or surgical excision\\n.\\nSimple cyst:\\nUS findings that allow a confident diagnosis of a simple ovarian cyst are: The US-image shows two simple cysts in the right ovary with ovarian stroma in between. The surrounding ves\\nsels are normal and there are no vascularized septations. These were simple follicular cysts in a premenopausal woman. Differential diagnosis Most simple cysts are functional cysts,\\n usually follicular cysts. \\nThey are commonly seen in premenopausal women, but functional cysts also still do occur in postmenopausal women. Some simple cysts may turn out to be paraovarian or paratubal cysts.\\n A hydrosalpinx may also mimic an ovarian cyst. Cystadenomas can also present as simple cysts, but they usually present as a large cyst in a postmenopausal woman. In a large cancer \\nscreening study from 1987 to 2002 including 15,106 women of 50 years or older, 2763 women (18%) were diagnosed with a unilocular ovarian cyst. None of these isolated unilocular cyst\\ns turned out to be ovarian cancer (4). In women of reproductive age, cysts up to 3 cm are a normal physiologic finding. \\nThese simple physiologic cysts do not need to be described in the imaging report and do not require follow-up (1). Cysts up to 7 cm in both pre- and postmenopausal woman are almost \\ncertainly benign. Cysts larger than 7 cm may be difficult to assess completely with US and therefore further imaging with MR or surgical evaluation should be considered. Normal ovar\\nies Functional cysts Hemorrhagic cyst\\nHemorrhagic ovarian cyst - HOC:\\nWhen a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. US findings that allow a confident diagnosis of a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst ar\\ne: In premenopausal women short term follow-up is recommended in hemorrhagic cysts > 5 cm. The same follow-up is recommended in early postmenopausal women who have a cyst with all t\\nhe characteristics of a HOC\\nLarger hemorrhagic cysts in the early menopause and any hemorrhagic cyst in the late menopause should be considered possibly neoplastic and MRI or surgical evaluation should be cons\\nidered. Hemorrhagic cyst with a clot mimicking a neoplasm. Notice absence of flow and good through-transmission (arrow) Differential diagnosis When hemorrhagic cysts present with di\\nffuse low-level echoes, their appearance can be similar to that of endometriomas. In the acute phase a hemorrhagic cyst may be completely filled with low-level echoes, simulating a \\nsolid mass (5). Clot in a hemorrhagic cyst may occasionally mimic a solid nodule in a neoplasm. Clot, however, often has concave borders due to retraction, while a true mural nodule\\n has outwardly convex borders. In both cases there will be no internal flow at Doppler US and there will be good through-transmission. Hemorrhagic cysts typically resolve within 8 w\\neeks. The ultrasound image shows multiple simple and one complex right ovarian cyst, with diffuse low-level echos and absence of flow on Doppler US. Note that there is good through-\\ntransmission, also through the complex cyst (blue arrow). On the T1 with fatsat the lesion remains bright, ruling out a fatty lesion. After Gd administration there is no enhancement\\n, confirming that this is a cystic hemorrhagic lesion, most likely a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, although your differential may include an endometrioma. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst\\nEndometrioma:\\nUS findings that allow a confident diagnosis of an endometrioma are: In women of any age, probable endometriomas require initial 6-12 week follow-up to rule out a hemorrhagic cyst. \\nUntil surgically removed, endometriomas require follow-up with ultrasound, for example on a yearly basis. This image from a vaginal ultrasound shows a large hypoechoic, cystic lesio\\nn with diffuse low-level echoes and two small echogenic foci. These have been postulated to be cholesterol deposits, but may also constitute small blood clots or debris. It is impor\\ntant to differentiate these echogenic foci from true wall nodules. Finding these echogenic foci makes the diagnosis of an endometrioma very likely. Endometrioma\\nMature cystic teratoma:\\nUS findings that are characteristic of a mature cystic teratoma are: Shown are transvaginal ultrasound images of two patients that demonstrate the 'tip-of-the-iceberg' sign: acousti\\nc shadowing from the hyperechoic part of the dermoid cyst (arrow). When misinterpreted as bowel gas, the lesion may be overlooked. Mature cystic teratoma\\nAny other cyst - possible neoplasm:\\nAll other cystic lesions are regarded as possibly neoplastic and therefore possibly malignant. Surgical resection is needed by an oncologic gynaecologist, who may request prior imag\\ning-based staging. Findings indicating possible neoplasm: While benign lesions can be very large, the likelihood that a lesion is neoplastic increases with size. Also the likelihood\\n that a neoplastic lesion is malignant, increases with the size of the lesion.\\n* Vascularized septations The presence of septations indicates a possible neoplasm. When septations have a thickness of more than 3mm and are well-vascularized - while non-specific \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 252}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"- both increase the likelihood that a neoplasm is malignant.\\n* Vascularized solid components Vascularized nodularities, papillary projections, or frank solid masses all increase the likelihood of a neoplastic nature.\\n* Vascularized thick, irregular wall Lesions with thin walls are more often benign and lesions with thick, irregular walls are more often malignant. However, there is some overlap, \\nmaking wall thickness a less useful criterion. For example a corpus luteum cyst may also have a thickened, vascularized wall.\\n* Secondary findings associated with malignant lesions: Large quantities of ascites, lymphadenopathy and peritoneal deposits are strongly associated with an increased likelihood of \\nmalignancy. Benign cystic ovarian neoplasms Malignant cystic ovarian neoplasms\\nLow-risk or High-risk:\\nOnce we have determined a cystic ovarian lesion is either a probable simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or mature cystic teratoma, or is indeterminate, the next step is to \\nplace the patient in a low-risk or high-risk group (table). The final decision to ignore, follow or excise a cystic ovarian lesion is based on: That said, the great majority of cyst\\nic ovarian lesions is benign. While the risk of malignancy does increase with age, even in post-menopausal women the risk of malignancy in a simple ovarian cyst\\nAlthough complex ovarian cysts in post-menopausal women are also most often benign, they do require further work-up, because of the chance of malignancy.\\n'the Roadmap':\\nThe natural history of incidentally detected pelvic masses with benign US morpgology is not known and therefore the optimal management is also unknown. The roadmap is based on the 2\\n010 Consensus Guidelines published in (1) and (2) and on the findings in (3) and (4). The mentioned size cut-offs and follow-up frequencies are accepted practices but not ironclad r\\nules. Local guidelines may differ based on the clinical scenario and institutional practice preferences. Many of the imaging criteria described in this article are the same for ultr\\nasound, CT and MRI, although of course not every feature is equally detectable on all modalities. Risk factors Age is the most important risk factor for all women. Lesions in pre-me\\nnopausal and post-menopausal women are managed differently. Several other factors (see table) may place a woman in a higher risk category. Concordantly, the roadmap shows two pathwa\\nys, one for lower-risk and one for higher-risk patients.\\nMRI protocol - which sequences, and why:\\nMRI protocol There are many possible 'Pelvic/Ovarian mass' protocols. The basic building blocks are simple and are the same for all protocols: A very short protocol may consist of o\\nnly 1, 2 and 3 (e.g., when the request is to 'rule out an ovarian mass'). Many radiologists prefer a slightly more comprehensive protocol including 4, and often 5. When the clinical\\n setting is characterization or staging of a known ovarian lesion, 4 (or CT) and 5 should always be included. The role of diffusion-weighted MRI is yet to be determined, but DWI is \\na useful aid in the detection of lymph nodes, tumors and peritoneal deposits. \\nFor the purpose of detection, the DW images are sometimes fused with (superimposed on) anatomical T2W images. \\nDWI cannot discriminate benign from metastatic lymph nodes. Further differences in protocols all arise as variations on this simple theme. For example:\\n* T2W images in more than 2 planes, or obliquely angled orthogonal to the anatomic structure of interest, are often useful for cervical or uterine-body pathology.:\\nMR imaging is a valuable adjunct to US, as it allows identification of blood products within hemorrhagic masses that may mimic solid tumor at US. Fat-suppressed T1-weighted MR image\\ns may reveal small amounts of fat, which allows the diagnosis of a mature teratoma ('dermoid'). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging depicts features of malignancy such as enhan\\ncing mural nodules and/or enhancing solid areas with or without necrosis (3). These MR images show a lesion with high signal on T1. This indicates either blood, other high protein c\\nontent or fat. On the image with fat-saturation there is suppression of the signal. This means that we are dealing with a fat-containig lesion, i.e. a mature cystic teratoma. The US\\n image shows an echogenic lesion. The corresponding lesion has a high signal on the T1-weighted MR image.\\nThis indicates either blood, high protein or fat. On the image with fat-saturation there is no suppression of the signal. This means that we are dealing with a blood-containig lesio\\nn, i.e. most likely a hemorrhagic cyst. by Deborah Levine et al September 2010 Radiology, 256, 943-954.\\n2.

In this article we will\\n focus on: Proper positioning of the ankle for radiography Trauma mechanism in ankle injuries\\nTrauma mechanism in ankle injuries:\\nNormal flexibility of the ankle:\\nThe ankle joint has to be flexible in order to deal with the enormous forces applied exerted on the talus within the ankle fork. . The medial side of the joint is quite rigid becaus\\ne the medial malleolus - unlike the lateral malleolus - is attached to the tibia and the medial collateral ligaments are very strong. On the lateral side there is a flexible support\\n by the fibula, syndesmosis and lateral collateral ligaments. This lateral complex allows the talus to move laterally and dorsally in exorotation during forward motion and subsequen\\ntly pushes it back into its normal position. The fibula has no weight-bearing function, but merely serves as a flexible lateral support. The syndesmosis is the fibrous connection be\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 253}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"tween the fibula and tibia formed by the anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments - located at the level of the tibial plafond (French for ceiling) - and the interosseus ligame\\nnt, which is the thickened lower portion of the interosseus membrane. The anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments are often referred to as anterior and posterior syndesmosis.\\nVulnerable positions of the foot:\\nThere are two positions of the foot in which the flexible ankle joint becomes a rigid and vulnerable system: extreme supination and pronation. In these positions forces applied to t\\nhe talus within the ankle mortise can result in fractures of the malleoli and rupture of the ligaments. In 80% of ankle fractures the foot is in supination. The injury starts on the\\n lateral side, since that is where the maximum tension is. In 20% of fractures the foot is in pronation with maximum tension on the medial side. The injury starts on the medial side\\n with either a rupture of the medial collateral ligaments or an avulsion of the medial malleolus.\\nPull-off or Push-off fractures:\\nThe shape of a fracture indicates which forces were involved.\\nAn oblique or vertically oriented fracture indicates 'push-off'. A transverse or horizontal fracture is the result of a 'pull-off' or avulsion. On the left image the lateral malleol\\nus is pushed off by exorotation of the talus. On the right image the medial malleolus is pulled off by the medial collateral ligament due to pronation of the foot. Ring of stability\\n in the coronal plane\\nStability:\\nThe ankle can be thought of as a ring in which bones as well as ligaments play an equally important role in the maintenance of joint stability. If the ring is broken in one place th\\ne ring remains stable. When it is broken in two places, the ring is unstable and may dislocate. Now anyone can figure out, that an ankle is unstable when both the medial and the lat\\neral malleoli are fractured. It becomes more problematic when there is a combination of a fracture and a ligamentous rupture, because the ligamentous rupture is not detectable on th\\ne X-ray. In some fractures there may even be a proximal fibular fracture - which is not visible on the ankle radiographs - in combination with ligamentous ruptures at the level of t\\nhe ankle. It is important to realize that in these cases the radiographs of the ankle may be normal, while there still is an unstable ankle injury. Ring of stability in the axial pl\\nane There is also an ring of stability in the axial plane. When the anterior and posterior syndesmosis rupture or avulse, then the ankle joint is also unstable. There are many combi\\nnations of avulsion fractures and ligamentous ruptures that can produce an unstable ring in the axial plane. A Anteriorly the anterior syndesmosis is usually one of the first struct\\nures to rupture. When the posterior syndesmosis also ruptures, then the ankle is unstable. B Less commonly the anterior syndesmosis avulses from the tibial attachment - Tillaux frac\\nture. C On the posterior side frequently the posterior malleolus avulses. Sometimes these fractures are difficult to detect, as we will discuss in a moment. D After the injury the b\\nones frequently align again, which makes it difficult to detect. Stability (2) It is important to realize, that for the stability of the ankle it doesn't matter whether there is a r\\nupture of a ligament or an avulsion at the insertion. Almost every ligamentous rupture has a fracture equivalent. Stability (3) On the left image a Weber A or SA-fracture. This ankl\\ne is stable because there is only an avulsion fracture of the lateral malleolus below the level of the syndesmosis. The ring is broken in only one place. On the right image there is\\n an unstable fracture. The ring of the ankle is broken in two places. There is a lateral fracture and on the medial side there is a rupture of the collateral ligament allowing the t\\nalus to dislocate laterally. Stability (4) The medial clear space should not exceed 4 mm and is usually equal to the distance between the tibial plafond and the talus. Widening of t\\nhe medial joint space up to 6 mm or more requires disruption of the medial collateral ligament. Stability (5) The lateral clear space is measured from the medial border of the fibul\\na to the lateral border of the posterior tibia 1cm above the tibial plafond. It is less well defined because its width varies with positioning. Evident widening of the lateral clear\\n space indicates syndesmotic rupture. Some state that a width of 5.5 mm is abnormal. It is very important to realize that a normal lateral or medial clear space does not exclude lig\\namentous rupture. It simply means that there is no dislocation, but there can still be instability. The case on the left shows a Weber B fracture. On these images the ankle fork is \\nnormal. Both the medial and lateral clear spaces are prominent, but within normal limits. We can conclude that there is no dislocation, but we do not know if there is rupture of the\\n medial collateral ligaments or of the syndesmosis. Continue with the images post surgery. Following osteosynthesis there is obvious widening of the medial and lateral clear spaces \\n(image on the far left). This indicates that there is a syndesmotic rupture and medial collateral ligament rupture. The ring is still broken in two places. The ankle joint is unstab\\nle and dislocated. Resurgery was necessary with placement of a syndesmotic screw to stabilize the ankle joint. Stability (6) On the left another case. There is a Weber B fracture. B\\noth the medial and lateral clear spaces are widened, indicating instability. The talus is displaced laterally. Patient was scheduled for osteosynthesis of the fibular fracture and p\\nlacement of a syndesmotic screw if necessary. After osteosynthesis of the fibula, the ankle was tested in the operating room and found to be stable. There was no indication for a sy\\nndesmotic screw. It was concluded that the syndesmosis was only partially ruptured, as is usually the case in Weber B fractures. The ring was broken in two places and after repairin\\ng one of them, the ring was stable.\\nOttawa Ankle Rules:\\nThese rules are used to determine the need for radiographs in patients with an ankle injury. Ankle X-ray series are only required in case of: Pain in the malleolar zone and any one \\nof the following:\\nRadiography:\\nMortise view:\\nA basic radiographic examination of the injured ankle consists of an AP-view, a Mortise-view and a lateral view. The Mortise-view is an AP-view taken with a 15-25? endorotation of t\\nhe foot. The technologist turns the foot inwards until the lateral malleolus is at the same height as the medial malleolus. This view visualizes both the lateral and medial joint sp\\naces. On a true AP-view the talus overlaps a portion of the lateral malleolus, obscuring the lateral aspect of the ankle joint. The distal fibula should project on the posterior par\\nt of the distal tibia\\nLateral view:\\nMany think that for a good lateral view the distal fibula should be in the center of the distal tibia. However, since the fibula is positioned more dorsally, the fibula should proje\\nct over the posterior part of the distal tibia (arrow). Malpositioning of the lateral view\\nMalpositioning of the Lateral view:\\nMalpositioning of the lateral view is the most common mistake in radiography of the injured ankle. Because the patient is in pain, the technologist is afraid to let the patient turn\\n the ankle fully lateral. This is one of the reasons why we miss so many fractures of the posterior malleolus. The CT demonstrates a large tertius fracture. On the lateral view and \\nalso on the AP- and Mortise views, which will be shown in the paragraph on tertius fractures, this fracture was not visible. The explanation is that on the lateral radiograph the fi\\nbula projects in the middle of the tibia. The x-ray beam is not parallel to the fracture line. Since the fracture line of a tertius fracture always has this orientation, we must ins\\nist on a true lateral view. Good positioning of the lateral view - Tertius fracture On a well positioned lateral view the tertius fracture is obvious (red arrow). This was the only \\nfracture that was seen on the x-rays of the ankle and this patient turned out to have an unstable Weber-C fracture and went for surgery. The x-ray beam has to be centered on the mal\\nleoli. Notice the exorotation of the foot for a proper lateral view.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 254}),\n",

The variable US features in the different stages of app\\nendicitis will be dealt with, as well as the problem of spontaneously resolving appendicitis and the appendiceal abscess. Pitfalls and differential diagnosis are discussed here. For\\n technique and normal anatomy: see “US of the GI tract” For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com\\nIntroduction:\\nAppendicitis is still the most common abdominal emergency in the  Western world. There is a lifetime risk of 8 % to develop appendicitis, and yearly in the U.S.A  300.000 people  un\\ndergo appendectomy. The clinical diagnosis can be very difficult, and before the advent of US and CT, the negative appendectomy rate was around 30 %, while, on the other hand, initi\\nal delay of necessary surgery was also not uncommon. This US image shows an inflamed appendix in the axial (left) and longitudinal (right) view. This chapter on US  for appendicitis\\n is meant for all those actively involved in acute abdominal US.\\nPathophysiology of appendicitis:\\nThe appendix is a blind-ending tube with a narrow lumen.\\nIt contains feces and is easily obstructed. When obstruction occurs, within hours the intraluminal pressure increases, due to continuous secretion of mucinous fluid by the appendix \\nmucosa. \\nWhen this pressure exceeds the pressure in the vessels of the appendix wall, ischemic necrosis may occur, leaving the mucosa defenseless against the bacteria present in the appendix\\n lumen Depending on the inflammatory reaction of the human defense mechanism, the pathophysiological cascade of obstruction - high pressure -  ischemic necrosis -  bacterial attack \\nwith perforation, results in a clinical presentation. This has a wide variation ranging from mild, spontaneously resolving appendicitis to life threatening perforating appendicitis,\\n and everything in-between. In this very lean patient with early acute appendicitis, US reveals dilatation of the distal appendix. In plane A, Doppler US shows strong hypervasculari\\nzation of the wall,  however in plane B no vessels are visible in the appendix wall due to high intraluminal pressure. Note the dilated, non-compressible, round appendix in B, bulgi\\nng into the abdominal wall during compression (arrowheads), with only vascularization in the fatty meso-appendix. The natural course of untreated appendicitis is reflected in this t\\nable. \\nExact mortality rates in the era before surgery and antibiotics are unknown, but were probably around 10 - 20 %.   \\nNowadays, mortality due to appendicitis has decreased to around 0,1 % , mainly due to early surgery, antibiotics and better diagnosis: US, CT, MRI and also the important lab value C\\nRP. Note that in about one in five cases, appendiceal obstruction is relieved in an early phase. \\nThis results in spontaneously resolving appendicitis, which entity will be discussed later.\\nClinical signs of appendicitis:\\nCourtesy: Hamilton Bailey The classic clinical signs of appendicitis are (sub)acute abdominal pain, starting in the epigastric or periumbilical area (= visceral pain-phase).\\nAfter 4 to 6 hours shifting towards the right lower quadrant (RLQ), where local peritonitis develops.However symptoms can be very atypical and treacherous, and the only constant sig\\nn is acute or subacute abdominal pain. The clinical diagnosis of appendicitis is difficult, and is often wrongly made and  initially overlooked, lea\\xadding to unnecessary surge\\xadry res\\npec\\xadtively to ill-advised delay. \\nBefore US and CT, the negative appendectomy rate reported in the literature was 28 % (Pieper R. Acta Chir Scand 1982;148: 51-62) while in-hospital delay occurred in about 20 %. US a\\nnd CT as well as the use of CRP, have brought down both numbers to around 5 %.\\nThe role of lab findings:\\nIn the diagnosis of appendicitis the most valuable lab findings are WBC  (White Bloodcell Count) and CRP  (C- Reactive Protein). \\nIn early acute appendicitis, the WBC rapidly increases within a few hours and often returns to normal after 12 - 24 hours. \\nThe CRP remains normal during the first 6-12 hours, and then  increases, with values that -dependent  of the inflammatory reaction- vary from 30 to 500 (mg/l). In a patient with > 2\\n4 hours of symptoms and a normal CRP, the chance for appendicitis is very low.\\nThe only exception is spontaneous resolving appendicitis. Careful matching patient’s history, lab and US findings is key. Other laboratory values are mainly valuable in the differen\\ntial diagnosis of appendicitis.\\nUS of normal vs inflamed appendix:\\nThe US features of the normal appendix are discussed in “US of the GI tract: normal anatomy”. Differentiating an inflamed appendix from a normal one is quite easy in most cases. Nor\\nmal appendix – can be visualized in 20-30 % of cases. Inflamed appendix - can be visualized in 80-90 % of cases. There is overlap between the diame\\xadter of the normal and inflamed ap\\npendix: The appendix diameter of normal and inflamed appendices on CT shows even a greater overlap. The explanation for this phenomenon is described in “US of the GI tract: normal a\\nnatomy”. Two asymptomatic individuals with large, feces-filled but non-inflamed appendices demonstrated by US  and CT scan. Note complete absence of inflamed fat in both.\\nUS of appendicitis:\\nAppendicitis with intraluminal fecolith (arrows) is found at the level of obstruction (a and v = iliac artery and vein). The typical appearance of an inflamed appendix: In the first\\n 6-12 hours the lumen of the appendix is strongly dilated with a thin wall and there is no inflamed fat yet. This patient presented with severe, acute periumbilical pain since 4 hou\\nrs and had no localized pain over the dilated appendix. (visceral pain-phase). Note the bulging of the tense appendix in the abdominal wall (arrowheads) during compression. These ap\\npendices are easily overlooked during US examination, due to the absence of circumscribed local pain ánd due to the absence of inflamed fat. \\nMoreover, these patients are often sent home without US or CT, because their visceral pain symptoms are interpreted and treated as “stomach or gallbladder problems”. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nInflamed fat:\\nThe fatty tissue that is first involved in appendicitis, is the mesentery of the appendix or meso-appendix. The normal fatty meso-appendix can be identified if outlined by some intr\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 255}),\n",

Roughly 4-6 hours after the onset of symptoms, the inflammation begins to affect the\\n meso-appendix, which becomes larger, more hyperechoic and non-compressible (arrowheads). The ensuing fibrin production on the serosal surface causes local peritonitis, resulting in\\n the well-known shift of pain from the periumbilical or epigastric area to the right lower quadrant. Interestingly, in the early stages of inflamed fat, US is more sensitive than CT\\n scan. In this patient with RLQ pain since 18 hours, CT showed only minimal fatty stranding around an 8.5 mm appendix (arrow). US with graded compression already shows unmistakable,\\n non-compressible, hyperechoic, inflamed fat (arrowheads) around the appendix. Later on in the disease process, this fatty tissue around the appendix tends to increase in volume. Th\\nis repre\\xadsents the fatty omentum, which has migrated towards the appendix in an attempt to wall-off the imminent perforation. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Slowly applied intermittent compression is the best way to identify the non-compressible inflamed fat. Compression of the ventrally located  bowel loop also reduces t\\nhe negative influence of gas. Eventually, also neighboring bowel and its mesentery become involved in the walling-off process. \\nIn this patient, US shows large quantities of inflamed fat (*) and the thickened ileum representing successful walling-off of the (imminent)  perforation of the appendix (arrow). \\nNote a calcified fecolith (arrow on CT scan) in the appendix at a higher level. The longer this process of  “walling-off” is going on, the more difficult appendectomy  is going to b\\ne. \\nThis dilemma is discussed  in the chapter “appendiceal mass”.\\nLayer structure:\\nAn irregu\\xadlar, asymmetrical echolucent con\\xadtour and loss of wall layer struc\\xadture indicate perforation or immi\\xadnent perforation of the appendix. In this stage there is always abunda\\nnt inflamed fat (arrowheads). The more the layer structure is affected, the higher the chance for perforation. The first sign being echolucent changes in the hyperechoic submucosa. \\nPredicting of perforation based on the US image is not very reliable but has little therapeutic consequences at that moment.\\nFree fluid:\\nA little echolucent intra-peritoneal fluid (*) has little meaning and can be found in both acute, non-perforated appendicitis (left) and perforated appendicitis (arrow) (middle), bu\\nt also in patients with a normal appendix (right). Larger quantities of fluid, especially if circumscribed and/or turbid, often accompanied by local or generalized paralytic ileus a\\nre suspect  for perforation. Usually these patients are ill, painful and have a high CRP. In this 56-year old lady with a CRP of 180, US revealed turbid intraperitoneal fluid (*) an\\nd possibly an inflamed appendix with fecoliths (arrows). CT confirmed two fecoliths in the RLQ with odd air-configurations, suspect for perforated appendicitis. US guided puncture c\\nonfirmed purulent fluid. Immediate surgery revealed perforated appendicitis with four quadrant contamination of the abdominal cavity with pus.\\nHypervascularization:\\nAs shown earlier,the vascularization of the appendix wall is initially decreased due to high intraluminal pressure. \\nHowever, this high pressure will drop again rapidly since the diseased appendix mucosa is not able to  maintain its normal fluid production anymore. \\nAs a result, in combination with the massive inflammatory response , strong reactive hypervascularization will occur rapidly: first in the surrounding fatty tissue and, soon after, \\nalso within the appendix wall.\\nSince this is the point in time, where patients usually seek medical help, this is the most familiar US image of the inflamed appendix.\\nSecondary signs of appendicitis:\\nIn patients in whom the appendix cannot be visualized by US and also no alternative condition can be found, secondary signs of appendicitis may be helpful. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll In this ill and painful patient the only US findings were a generalized paralytic ileus and a little turbid free fluid (*). Note that the only movement of the bowel i\\ns from in- and expiration. Subsequent CT and surgery confirmed purulent peritonitis from perforated appendicitis. This was an ill, 67-year old woman, CRP 310. \\nUS showed a combination of thickened ileal loops, paralytic ileus, inflamed fat and ill-defined fluidcollections (*), but no inflamed appendix or other cause of bowel perforation. C\\nT confirmed paralytic ileus and an inflamed appendix (arrow). \\nSurgery revealed severely contaminated purulent peritonitis from perforated appendicitis.\\nThe “appendiceal mass”:\\ncourtesy Dr. Netter Not infrequently, patients seek medical help (or are admitted) with considerable delay (> 4-5 days). \\nThese patients often present with a palpable mass and relatively mild peritonitis. \\nUS and CT often show a large mass of non-compressible fat around the appendix, often also with wall thickening of neighboring bowel loops. If there is a circumscribed pus collection\\n, the diagnosis is appendiceal  abscess. If not, the diagnosis is appendi\\xadceal phlegmon. *Choice dependent of many factors, amongst which experience and character of the surgeon.\\nAppendiceal phlegmon:\\nPatients with an appendi\\xadceal phlegmon are usually managed conser\\xadvatively because the surgeon knows from experience that appendectomy in such cases is technically difficult or even\\n impossible. The problem with the diagnosis of an appendiceal phlegmon is that there is large “grey zone” where the surgeon may not be sure whether to operate immediately or whether\\n to opt for conservative manage\\xadment.\\nThis is understandable since there is a gradual evolution from acute appendicitis to an appendiceal phlegmon. \\nIn the decision between surgery and wait-and-see, in general the clinical symptoms prevail over the US and CT findings. \\nA walled-off pus-collection within the appendiceal phlegmon, is usually a contra indication for immediate surgery. If conservative treatment of an appendiceal phlegmon is successful\\n, follow up US shows a decrease in size of the periappendiceal mass (arrowheads) within the course of weeks to  months. This patient was already symptom free from week three. US all\\nows rough objectification of the palpable mass (arrowheads) around the inflamed appendix, and can be used in follow-up. This also makes underlying malignancy unlikely. One of the ad\\nvantages of US over CT, is that using graded compression, US can estimate the dimensions of the “palpable” inflammatory mass (arrowheads) around the inflamed appendix. If necessary,\\n compressibility can also be tested on CT scan,  with the help of a wooden device, strapped to the abdomen of the patient (see insert). This obese patient with advanced appendicitis\\n and symptoms for eight days, CT with compression demonstrated a large, non-compressible inflammatory mass around the appendix. Nevertheless, the patient was immediately operated, b\\nased on clinical grounds. During operation the McBurney incision was extended at both ends, and an ileocecal resection eventually was  performed.\\nAppendiceal abscess:\\nIf next to the inflamed appendix, a more or less circumscribed fluid collec\\xadtion is found, this is suggestive for an appendiceal abscess. The collection often contains air, not infr\\nequently (~50 %) a fecolith and is surrounded by inflamed non-compres\\xadsible fatty tissue. The latter not only represents the omentum (“policeman of the belly”) but also the fatty ep\\niploic appendages and fatty mesentery. Together with neighboring bowel loops, this represents the -often successful- walling-off of the appendiceal abscess in  attempt to prevent sp\\nill of pus to the peritoneal cavi\\xadty.

If an appendiceal abscess is demonstrated and there is absent or only mild peritonitis\\n, percutaneous drainage is the treatment of choice. Dependent of symptoms and US/CT findings, acute laparotomy and wait-and-see are also options. In the majority of patients with an\\n appendiceal abscess, percutaneous drainage is the treatment of choice. CT is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, to delineate the extent of the abscess and to determine a safe acce\\nss route. Drainage using a combination of US and fluoroscopy has several advantages over CT guided drainage: it is rapid, allows continuous control, any angulation and the use of co\\nmpression during the procedure. This patient had a large appendiceal abscess, walled-off by ileum and cecum. A small window (arrow) allowed US-guided puncture. Insertion of the drai\\nn over a guidewire was done under fluoroscopic control. In this obese patient, drainage with the US probe using compression, allows the needle to approach the abscess closely. Note \\nthat compression here reduced the distance skin-to-abscess from10 to 3.5 cm. Spontaneous evacuation of appendiceal abscess. a and v = right iliac artery and vein In stable patients \\nwho have no fever and only mild pain, it may be wise to await spontaneous drainage of the abscess to neighboring bowel.\\nThis 75-year old lady had subsiding symptoms after 7 days of RLQ pain, and she told us that she was feeling much better now. US showed an inflamed appendix (arrow) with an adjacent \\nabscess, walled-off by inflamed fat and the terminal ileum.

The appendix (arrows) was small and still had in\\ntimate contact with the ileum (il.) Another 4 years later, at age 82,  she is still doing fine. The process of spontaneous evacuation of a puscollection to neighboring bowel can be \\nfollowed by doing repeated US. At the time of US, this patient with a large appendiceal abscess (arrowheads)  was feeling  much better and refused drainage. The next day he was almo\\nst symptom free after an episode with remarkably smelly stool. In hindsight two air bubbles (arrow) indicated impending evacuation of the pus to the cecal lumen. Spontaneous evacuat\\nion of a pus collection to neighboring bowel is nature’s most efficient way to get rid of an abscess or empyema. Other pathways (e.g. to the abdominal wall, to the vagina or to the \\nbladder) are slower and may result in fistula formation.

Some patients with an “appendiceal abscess” are better off with immediate surgery.\\nThese two patients were both ill with a high CRP and signs of generalized peritonitis. \\nUS and CT confirmed paralytic ileus and large, not-well walled-off air-fluid collections, and in the right patient some free air (arrows). \\nThese combined clinical and CT findings indicate a failing defense mechanism, warranting surgery. Children often present with free perforated appendicitis, because the disease progr\\nesses more rapidly and abscess formation is less effective than in adults. Children with an appendiceal abscess usually undergo surgery. In this 11 year old girl with a ten days old\\n large retrocecal abscess, both drainage and appendectomy was easily  performed laparoscopically. Finally, in patients with a small (< 2 cm)  abscess (*) close to the appendix (arro\\nws) who have only 3-4 days of symptoms, immediate appendectomy with removal of the small abscess is a good option. Note the fecolith (arrowhead) In difficult cases where the anatomi\\ncal situation in a patient with an acute abdomen is rather complex, communication with the surgeon is crucial. Rather than “label” a diagnosis in the US/CT report, it is better to d\\niscuss the US/CT findings together with the surgeon before the monitor.\\nSpontaneously resolving appendicitis:\\nAbout one in ten patients with acute appendicitis mentions one or more episodes of  the same symptoms over the past months or years, which symptoms at that point in time spontaneous\\nly subsided within a period of 12-24 hours. Laboratory shows an elevated WBC and no or only mildly elevated CRP. The increasing use of US and CT in patients with RLQ pain has learne\\nd that this phenomenon of so-called “spontaneously resolving appendicitis” is not rare. This young lady had typical signs of appendicitis for 24 hours (WBC 12 ,CRP 2). \\nUS  showed an inflamed appendix. \\nWithin a period of hours her symptoms rapidly decreased and she was not operated. US was performed 5 years later for other reasons and demonstrated a normal appendix. In this patien\\nt, the appendix (arrow) on admission showed a dilated lumen and minimal surrounding fat. After the US examination the patient had rapidly subsiding symptoms and was not operated. Th\\nree days later he was symptom free and US showed a compressible appendix (arrow) with a slightly thickened wall and a collapsed lumen and surrounded by some inflamed fat. These imag\\nes, the rather sudden resolution of symptoms and the usually low CRP, suggest that the cause of this phenomenon is relief of  luminal obstructi\\xadon at an early stage. This patient ha\\nd a classic history of appendicitis but was symptom free again at the time of US. US showed a small appendix (arrows) of 6 mm, surrounded by hyperemic, non-compressible, inflamed fa\\nt.  He recalled three similar attacks over the past 9 months, and was operated immediately. Surgical and histological findings confirmed acute inflammation, with transmural infiltra\\ntion with granulocytes. This young woman had pain in the RLQ for 24 hours (WBC 12, CRP 34), when she noticed rapid resolution of symptoms. \\nUS showed a small 6.5 mm hyperemic appendix (arrow), surrounded by inflamed fat. \\nShe was not operated and was symptom free the next day. \\nUS after 5 days showed normalization of the appendix (arrow). \\nThree years later, she had recurrent symptoms and US showed acute appendicitis. \\nSurgery revealed perforated appendicitis. Here the different stages of spontaneously resolving appendicitis are schematically represented. By the time patients with spontaneous reso\\nlving appendicitis undergo US, most are then in the stage of reactive hyperemia and reperfusion edema. These are US images of a strongly hyperemic, edematous but small appendix in s\\nix different patients, all with rapidly decreasing symptoms at that point in time. Note that the appendix is relatively small and has an intact layer structure.\\nPolicy in spontaneously resolving appendicitis:\\nCobben et al (Radiology 2000, 215: 349-52) followed up 60 patients with spontaneous resolving appendicitis who were not operated. Within two years 23 patients had recurrent appendic\\nitis, and in the following 15 years, another 7. This high recurrence rate (50 %) plus the fact that a future attack may come inconveniently, may play a role in clinical decision mak\\ning. It is imaginable that after each episode of appendicitis, the appendix wall becomes more vulnerable, leading to a higher chance of perforation. In recent years, more and more p\\natients with mild appendicitis symptoms receive antibiotics. This certainly supports a rapid recovery, but it is still uncertain if the recurrence rate will go down also (see below)\\n.\\nTreatment of appendicitis:\\nSurgery:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 257}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Ever since the recognition of the pathophysiological mechanism of appendicitis by Sir Reginald Fitz in 1886, there has been little doubt about the treatment: early appendectomy befo\\nre perforation can occur.\\nThe last decades,  the famous Lanz-McBurney incision is  increasingly replaced by laparoscopic appendectomy. After conservative treatment of an appendiceal mass, a so-called interva\\nl appendectomy can be done, but the usefulness of this operation remains controversial. Until ten years ago, the use of antibiotics was limited to patients with advanced, complicate\\nd appendicitis, associated with septicaemia. \\nRecently,  several studies have shown that early appendicitis can also be primarily treated with antibiotics only.\\nAntibiotics for early appendicitis:\\nSeveral studies have shown that a selected group of patients with acute appendicitis and mild symptoms, first attack, low CRP, no fecolith and no perforation, can be rapidly cured w\\nith antibiotic treatment alone. However,  there is a high number of late recurrences up to 40 % for whom surgery at a later moment in time is necessary (Salminen et al. JAMA 2018;32\\n0:1259-65). Another drawback of non-operative treatment is that US and CT are an uncertain gold standard. The presence of a fecolith is considered a contra-indication for primary co\\nnservative treatment of appendicitis with antibiotics. \\nIn this respect, there is a remarkable analogy with gallbladder stones. Once a gallbladder stone (large arrow) has been proven to obstruct the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, there\\n is wide consensus that cholecystectomy ASAP is indicated. \\nSimilarly, patients with proven symptomatic obstruction of the appendix due to a fecolith (small arrow), should undergo appendectomy ASAP. Gallbladder and appendix have in common: F\\nurther studies will have to decide whether the 65 % of patients with obstructive appendicitis without a fecolith, will eventually benefit from primary antibiotic treatment.\\nNone:\\nAnal cancer staging:\\nMonique Maas and Doenja Lambregts\\nRadiology department of the Netherlands Cancer Institute Amsterdam:\\nAnal cancer is a rare malignancy with a worldwide\\nincidence of approximately 1.5 per 100.000. \\nAlmost all anal cancers are\\nsquamous cell carcinomas. \\nImaging plays a vital role in the staging and\\ntreatment planning of anal cancer. \\nThe diagnostic work-up consists of\\nproctoscopy with biopsies, MRI of the pelvis, ultrasound (with fine needle\\naspiration) for the inguinal nodes, and CT or FDG-PET for the detection\\nof further nodal and distant metastasis. \\nChemoradiation (CRT) is the\\nstandard treatment for most anal cancers, after which 80-90% of patients\\nachieve a complete remission. \\nIn patients with residual tumor, additional\\nsurgery is required. \\nSome patients with small tumors at the perianal skin may\\nbe managed with primary local excision instead of CRT. \\nNodal involvement is\\ncommon in anal SCC and is usually treated with a radiation boost on the regional\\nlymph nodes.\\nIntroduction:\\nChecklist for staging:\\nThis is a checklist for the\\nstructured reporting of anal cancer at baseline staging.\\nAll these items will be discussed in the following chapters.

When describing involvement of the internal and external anal sphincter, it is useful to describe both the cranioucaudal extent \\n(e.g. upper half,  lower half or full length of the anal canal) as well as the level of circumferential involvement (e.g. from … till … o’clock).

Other reported criteria include: These criteria do not have a strong evidence base and\\n will inherently lead to both over- and understaging.\\nThe most accurate nodal staging modality is 18F-FDG-PET-CT, with a sensitivity of 56-99% and specificity of 90-100% (1,2).\\nUltrasound with fine needle aspiration is usually done as an adjunct to MRI and PET-CT, but in some centers it is used as the primary modality for loco-regional nodal staging.

On x-rays this can only be suspected when there is angulation or translation MR will dem\\nonstrate subtle injuries to the soft tissues.

The findings are: In this patient we can conclude that there was mild hyperflexion strain and we do n\\not know if a special treatment is required, since these were isolated MR-findings without evidence of fracture or abnormal positioning. There is controversy regarding the meaning of\\n soft tissue abnormalities detected only on MRI. Signal changes do not necessarily equate with structural failure. These findings still require better validation. In trauma centres \\nup to 25% of all patients with neck injury have signal abnormalities on MR and the significance is indeterminate. Hyperflexion sprain Hyperflexion sprain (2) On the left images of a\\n 44 year old female, who sustained a fall on the ice.

In such a case MRI is the n\\next step. First we show you a coronal and axial CT with also a soft tissue window-setting. There is high density material at the back of the disc space, which is very suggestive for\\n a traumatic disc herniation.

Right vertebral artery thrombosis The MRA conf\\nirms the occlusion of the right vertebral artery.\\nUnilateral interfacet dislocation:\\nUnilateral interfacet dislocation is due to a hyperflexion injury with rotation. The superior facet on one side slides over the inferior facet and becomes locked. This results in an\\n anterior subluxation of the upper vertebral body of about 25% of the AP diameter of the body. Simple unilateral facet dislocation is a stable injury. 30% of patients have an associ\\nated neurologic defect. MRI plays an important role in the diagnosis in order to see if there is disc extrusion leading to cord compression.

When the dislocation is complete, the dislocated vertebra is anteriorly displaced\\n one-half of the AP diameter of the vertebral body.

The teardrop fragment comes from the anteroinferior aspect of the vertebral body. The larger posterior part of the vertebral\\n body is displaced backward into the spinal canal. On x-rays the facet joints and interspinous distances are usually widened and the disk space may be narrowed. 70% of patients have\\n neurologic deficit. It is an unstable fracture associated with complete disruption of ligaments and anterior cord syndrome. Flexion tear drop fracture due to diving injury On the l\\neft images of a 21 year old male who sustained a diving injury, striking his head in a swimming pool. He had immediate onset of upper and lower extremity weakness. First study the i\\nmages. Then continue reading. The findings are: Some would just call this a severe hyperflexion injury, but this entity is better known as a 'flexion tear drop' fracture. Look for a\\ndditional findings on the CT-images and then continue reading. The findings are: In fact these vertebral bodies kind of 'exploded' with propulsion of a bone fragment anteriorly (tea\\nrdrop) and the larger part posteriorly against the spinal cord. Continue with the MR-images. Flexion tear drop fracture (2) Look for additional findings on the MR-images and then co\\nntinue reading. The findings are: Flexion tear drop fracture (3) On the left images of a similar case. There is a C5 flexion teardrop fracture. Notice that the lower cervical area i\\ns not visualised well and additional imaging is required. The CT-images demonstrate the extreme axial loading. The tear drop fragment is displaced anteriorly and the larger part of \\nthe vertebral body is displaced posteriorly compressing the spinal cord. Continue with the MR-images. T1W- and T2W-images with fatsat. The MR-images demonstrate the spinal injury. I\\nt is a hemorrhagic injury, which has a poor outcome. Also notice the posterior ligamentous injury as a result of the hyperflexion with rupture of the ligamentum flavum and CSF leaka\\nge. Central spinal cord injury Notice the central location of the spinal cord injury.\\nHyperextension injuries:\\nHangman' s fracture:\\nThe Hangman' s fracture is the most common cervical spine fracture. Classically it is an extension-fracture as the hangman puts the knot under the chin to produce maximal extension-\\nforce. That is why we discuss the hangman' s fracture in the chapter on hyperextension injuries. In some situations however it can also be the result of extreme flexion. The hangman\\n's fracture is common in diving accidents. Although considered an unstable fracture, it seldom is associated with spinal injury, since the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal can\\nal is greatest at this level, and the fractured pedicles allow decompression. When associated with unilateral or bilateral facet dislocation at the level of C2, this type of hangman\\n's fracture is unstable and has a high rate of neurologic complications. Classification of Hangman' s fractures Hangman' s fracture type I On the left images of a restrained passeng\\ner in a vehicle going about 55 miles per hour . She ran into a tree at about 9 p.m. the previous night with questionable loss of consciousness. She had cervical tenderness to palpat\\nion, but was alert and had no neurologic abnormalities on examination. First study the images on the left.\\nThen continue reading. The findings are: Continue with the CT-images. The CT-images confirm the fracture-lines of the hangman's fracture. They run through the pars interarticularis \\nresulting in a traumatic spondylolysis. In this case there was no neurologic deficit, because the spinal canal is widened at the level of the fracture. Hangman' s fracture type I On\\n the left images of another patient with a type I Hangman' s fracture. There is a hair-line fracture and there is no displacement.\\nHyperextension with superimposed spondylosis:\\nOn the left images of a 90-year-old male who tripped and fell on his back and the back of his head. He had immediate quadriparesis after the event with no loss of consciousness. Fir\\nst study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The findings are: Continue with the CT-images. On CT we also see that there has been a hyperextension injury. The small black\\n dots in the disc space are the result of a vacuum phenomena. The negative pressure resulted in a vacuum phenomena in the injured disc space. There is also some hyperdensity at the \\nback of C5C6, which could be a herniated disc or just preexisting disc degeneration. In such a patient with spondylosis which has led to narrowing of the canal, a low velocity injur\\ny can lead to spinal cord injury. Continue with the MR-images. The MR shows a subtle increase in signal intensity of the spinal cord. Most of the time these patiets get a central co\\nrd injury. There is only injury to the central part of the cord and these patients have disproportioned weakness of their arms and normal strength in their legs. These injuries can \\nbe devastating, although it is uncommon that they are hemorrhagic. Hyperextension with superimposed spondylosis Hyperextension injury (3) On the left two other examples of this hype\\nrextension injury. It is easy to find the injured disc, since it is the one with the high signal (arrows). Notice the prevertebral soft tissue swelling in the case on the right.\\nExtension teardrop fracture:\\nAs with flexion teardrop fracture, extension teardrop fracture also manifests with a displaced anteroinferior bony fragment (6). This fracture occurs when the anterior longitudinal \\nligament pulls a bony fragment away from the inferior aspect of the vertebra because of the sudden hyperextension. The fragment is a true avulsion, in contrast to the flexion teardr\\nop fracture in which the fragment is produced by compression. This type of fracture is commonly seen in diving accidents and tends to occur at lower cervical levels. It also may be \\nassociated with the central cord syndrome due to buckling of the ligamenta flava into spinal canal during the hyperextension phase of injury. This injury is stable in flexion but hi\\nghly unstable in extension. On the left images of a 70 year old female who fell down ten steps striking her head resulting in a subgaleal hematoma with possible loss of consciousnes\\ns. There was no neurologic deficit. Notice the anteroinferior bony fragment of C2. Continue with the CT images. The CT confirms the displaced anteroinferior bony fragment. This frag\\nment is a true avulsion, in contrast to the flexion teardrop fracture in which the fragment is produced by compression of the anterior vertebral aspect due to hyperflexion. Continue\\n with the MR images. The MR also confirms that this is not a flexion injury, since the soft tissue injury is located anteriorly. Extension-teardrop fracture (2) On the left another \\nextension-teardrop fracture of C2.\\nFractures due to axial loading:\\nJefferson fracture:\\nThis fracture is caused by a compressive downward force that is transmitted evenly through the occipital condyles to the superior articular surfaces of the lateral masses of C1. Thi\\ns process displaces the masses laterally and causes fractures of the anterior and posterior arches, along with possible disruption of the transverse ligament. Radiographically the f\\nracture is characterized by bilateral lateral displacement of the articular masses of C1.\\nOther injuries:\\nOdontoid fracture:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 263}),\n",

Harris' measurement for AO-DissociationRule of twelves= distance from tip of dens to basion or from basion to posterio\\nr line should not exceed 12 mm in an adult.\\nAtlanto-occipital dislocation:\\nAtlanto-occipital dislocation is an uncommon injury characterized by complete disruption of all ligaments between occiput and atlas with subluxation or complete dislocation of the o\\nccipitoatlantal factes. Anterior translation of the skull on the vertebral column is the most common presentation. Death usually occurs immediately from stretching of the brainstem,\\n which causes respiratory arrest. It is reported to occur in 31% of fatal MVAs. It is more common in children due to the larger head. Up to 50% of atlanto-occipital dislocations are\\n overlooked initially, which can have catastrophic results, since cervical traction can be fatal. Power's ratio is sometimes used as a measurement for the relationship between skull\\n base and spine, but Harris' measurement for AO-dissociation has a greater sensitivity (figure).

Late - after the first week Morphologic criteria based on CT findings combined with clinical parameters determine the care of the patient. The severity is classified into three c\\nategories based on clinical and morphologic findings: 15-20% of cases. Morphologically, there are two types of acute pancreatitis:\\nDiagnosis of Acute Pancreatitis:\\nThe diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features: Acute onset of persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back.\\n2.

              " Document(page_content='3. Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) and less commonly MRI or US. The diagnosis is usually established when there is a combination of abdo\\nminal pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes and CECT is not required, unless there is uncertainty about the diagnosis. These images are of a patient who presented with acute severe e\\npigastric pain very suggestive of acute pancreatitis. However the amylase level was within normal levels. A CECT was performed. The findings are: There were no complications and the\\n diagnosis of mild pancreatitis was made.\\nClinical outcome:\\nEarly severity stratification of acute pancreatitis is important to identify patients with the highest morbidity. These patients may benefit from timely transfer to the intensive ca\\nre unit or tertiary referral centre. Mild pancreatitis These patients have no organ failure. Most of them have no fluid collections and no necrosis. These patients usually recover b\\ny the end of the first week. Moderate severe and severe pancreatitis The clinical condition of the patient is determined by the host response to the pancreatitis. Cytokine cascades \\nresult in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which increases the risk of organ failure. The presence of organ failure is determined by respiratory (pO2↓), renal (crea\\ntinine↑) and cardiovascular failure (blood pressure↓). The extent of morphologic changes like necrosis and fluid collections is not directly proportional to the severity of organ fa\\nilure. Many of these patients however will have necrotizing pancreatitis and the mortality increases when the necrosis becomes infected.\\nAtlanta Classification of Fluid Collections:\\nThe 2012 Revised Atlanta Classification discerns 4 types of peripancreatic fluid collections in acute pancreatitis depending on the content, degree of encapsulation and time. On CT,\\n the discrimination between an APFC and ANC may be difficult, especially in the first weeks and the term \"indeterminate peripancreatic collections\" can be used. All these collection\\ns may remain sterile or become infected. Infection is rare during the first week. The table summarizes the CT criteria for pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections in acute p\\nancreatitis. Acute Peripancreatic Fluid Collections contain fluid only and are not or only partially encapsulated. They are seen within 4 weeks in interstitial pancreatitis. Frequen\\ntly they regress spontaneously.\\n2. ANC Acute Necrotic Collections contain a mixture of fluid and necrotic material. They are not or only partially encapsulated. They are seen within 4 weeks in necrotizing pancreat\\nitis.\\n3. PseudocystAfter 4 weeks in interstitial pancreatitis. This fluid collection is encapsulated. Pseudocysts are uncommon in acute pancreatitis. Most persistent fluid collections als\\no contain some necrotic material.\\n4. WONAfter 4 weeks most necrotic collections are fully encapsulated and are called Walled-off Necrosis (WON).\\nCT severity index:\\nThe CT severity index (CTSI) combines the Balthazar grade (0-4 points) with the extent of pancreatic necrosis (0-6 points) on a 10-point severity scale. On the day of admission, sco\\nring systems based on imaging do not outperform scoring systems based on clinical and biochemical parameters with regard to predicting clinical outcome. Therefore, performing CT on \\nday of admission solely for prediction purposes is not recommended.\\nImaging:\\nCT:\\nCT is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis and staging of acute pancreatitis and its complications.\\nUltrasound and ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction play an important role in biliary pancreatitis. Since the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is usually made on clinical an\\nd laboratory findings, an early CT is only recommended when the diagnosis is uncertain, or in case of suspected early complications such as bowel perforation or ischemia. An early C\\nT may be misleading regarding the morphologic severity of the pancreatitis, because it may underestimate the presence and amount of necrosis. The images show a normally enhancing pa\\nncreas on day 1. As the patient\\'s condition worsened, a second CT was performed on day 3. Notice how the greater part of the pancreatic body and tail no longer enhances indicating n\\necrotizing pancreatitis (arrows). The first CT underestimated the severity of the pancreatitis. This patient died on day 5 due to severe SIRS and multiple organ failure.\\nInterstitial pancreatitis:\\nMorphologically there are 2 types of acute pancreatitis - interstitial or oedematous pancreatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis.. Here an example of interstitial pancreatitis. There \\nis normal enhancement of the entire pancreatic gland with only mild surrounding fatty infiltration. There are no fluid collections and there is no necrosis of the pancreatic parench\\nyma. CTSI: 2 points. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Here another case of interstitial pancreatitis without necrosis. Scroll through the images. The pancreas is swollen and there is peripancreatic inflammation (2 points\\n). No fluid collections. No pancreatic necrosis. CTSI: 2 points\\nNecrotizing Pancreatitis:\\nNecrosis of pancreatic parenchyma or peripancreatic tissues occurs in 10-15 % of patients. It is characterized by a protracted clinical course, a high incidence of local complicatio\\nns, and a high mortality rate. There are 3 subtypes of necrotizing pancreatitis: Necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma can be diagnozed on a contrast-enhanced CT ⩾ 72 hours. Necrosi\\ns of peripancreatic tissue can be vary difficult to diagnose, but is suspected when the collection is inhomogeneous, i.e. various densities on CT.. The CT shows an acute necrotizing\\n pancreatitis. The body and tail of the pancreas do not enhance. There is normal enhancement of the pancreatic head (arrow). More than 50% of the pancreas is necrotic and there are \\nat least two collections. CTSI: 4 + 6 = 10 points.\\nMRI:\\nMRI is superior to CT in differentiating between fluid and solid necrotic debris. Here a patient with several homogeneous peripancreatic collections on CT. These collections also sh\\now homogeneous high signal intensity on a fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI image, are fully encapsulated and contain clear fluid (i.e. pseudocysts). This patient had an acute necrotiz\\ning pancreatitis with onset 2 months earlier. The CT-image shows a homogeneous peripancreatic collection in the transverse mesocolon (arrow). A T2-weighted MRI sequence shows that t\\nhe collection has a low signal intensity (arrow). Most likely this is necrotic fat tissue (i.e. sterile necrosis or walled-off necrosis). This patient had no fever or signs of sepsi\\ns. Endoscopic or percutaneous drainage would have little or no effect on its size, but increases the risk of infection.\\nPeripancreatic Collections:\\nSpontaneous regression of APFC.\\nAcute Peripancreatic Fluid Collection - APFC:\\nIntraabdominal fluid collections and collections of necrotic tissue are common in acute pancreatitis. These collections develop early in the course of acute pancreatitis. In the ear\\nly stage, such a collection does not have a wall or capsule. Preferred locations of fluid collections are: These collections are the result of the release of activated pancreatic en\\nzymes which also cause necrosis of the surrounding tissues. This explains why many of these collections harbor solid necrotic debris. About 50% of these collections show spontaneous\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 265}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\" regression (figure). The remaining 50% either remain stable or increase and undergo organization and demarcation with liquefaction. They may remain sterile or develop infection. Th\\ne images show spontaneous regression of an acute peripancreatic fluid collection (APFC).\\nAcute Necrotic Collection - ANC:\\nStudy the image. What are the findings? Then continue reading. The findings are: We can conclude that this is an acute necrotic collection - ANC. ANC (2) Study the images and then c\\nontinue reading. What are the findings? The findings are: On day 5 this collection can be diagnosed as probable acute necrotic collection. On day 18 an incomplete wall is present, b\\nut we can assume that in a couple of days this will be a walled-of-necrosis with a complete wall. When peripancreatic collections persist or increase, it is usually due to the prese\\nnce of fat necrosis. Because fat does not enhance on CT, the diagnosis of fat necrosis can be difficult. Necrosis can be diagnosed with MRI, which of course should only be performed\\n if it has direct clinical implications. Pseudocyst\\nPseudocyst:\\nThis patient presented with a gastric outlet obstruction 2 months after an episode of acute pancreatitis. There is a homogeneous well-demarcated peripancreatic collection in the les\\nser sac, which abuts the stomach and the pancreas. The patient did not have fever. The collection underwent successful percutaneous drainage, which showed clear fluid with high amyl\\nase and subsequently resolved along with the patient's symptoms. Therefore, this collection proved to be a true pancreatic pseudocyst. A Pseudocyst is a collection of pancreatic jui\\nce or fluid enclosed by a complete wall of fibrous tissue It occurs in interstitial pancreatitis and the absence of necrotic tissue is imperative for its diagnosis. Communication wi\\nth the pancreatic duct may be present. A pseudocyst requires 4 or more weeks to develop. The differential diagnosis includes walled-off necrosis and sometimes a pseudoaneurysm or ev\\nen a cystic tumor. Most often, they occur in the lesser sac. Most collections that persist after 4 weeks are walled-of-necrosis. True pseudocysts are uncommon, since most acute peri\\npancreatic fluid collections resolve within 4 weeks. Walled-off-necrosis\\nWalled-off Necrosis - WON:\\nBased on CT alone it is sometimes impossible to determine whether a collection contains fluid only or a mixture of fluid and necrotic tissue. Consequently it is sometimes better to \\ndescribe these as 'indeterminate peripancreatic collections'. The images are of a patient with acute pancreatitis. On the upper image is a collection in the area of the pancreatic h\\nead in the right anterior pararenal space. At this stage, it is not possible to distinguish between an acute peripancreatic fluid collection and acute necrotic collection. On a foll\\now-up scan the collection in the right anterior pararenal space increased in size. It has fluid density and a thin enhancing wall. This can be a pseudocyst or walled-off-necrosis an\\nd it may or may not be infected. The patient became septic and a percutaneous drainage was performed. After drainage the collection barely diminished in size. The patient underwent \\nsurgery and the collection was found to consist of necrotic debris, which was not appreciated on CT, hence this was a walled-off-necrosis and not a pseudocyst. The necrotic debris w\\nas too viscous for successful percutaneous drainage. Walled-off-necrosis (2) These CT-images are of a patient on day 40. This patient had central gland necrosis and now developed fe\\nver. The CT shows a similar collection of fluid density to that of the patient with the pseudocyst, except for its pancreatic location. The collection is homogeneous and well-demarc\\nated with a thin wall abutting the stomach. During endoscopic debridement this collection contained fluid and necrotic tissue, which was removed from the area of the pancreas. Altho\\nugh the imaging characteristics in this case are similar to the patient with the pseudocyst, this proved to be infected walled-off-necrosis. Walled-off-necrosis (3) Here we see a ho\\nmogeneous pancreatic and peripancreatic collection, well demarcated with an enhancing wall, on day 25 of an episode of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. This patient had fever and mul\\ntiple organ failure. Therefore, this collection was suspected to be infected WON and not a pseudocyst. At surgery, the collection contained much necrotic debris, which was not depic\\nted on CT. These cases illustrate that at times CT cannot reliably differentiate between collections that consist of fluid only and those that contain fluid and solid necrotic debri\\ns with or without infection.\\nInfected necrosis:\\nInfected necrosis is: This case is a typical example of infected pancreatic necrosis. The necrosis also involves the peripancreatic tissue. So this is an ANC - acute necrotic collec\\ntion.\\n* On day 17 there are gas bubbles in the necrotic collection consistent with infected pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis. A wall surrounds the collection. The term pancreatic ab\\ncess is no longer used, since a collection of pus without necrotic tissue is extremely uncommon in acute pancreatitis. Infected necrosis (2) In this patient there is normal enhancem\\nent of the pancreas with surrounding septated heterogeneous acute necrotic collections with fluid- and fat densities. This is probably necrosis of the peripancreatic tissues. Two we\\neks later there are gas bubbles in the peripancreatic collection consistent with an infected acute necrotic collection. This patient underwent surgery. The surgeon removed a large a\\nmount of necrotic tissue and estimated he had removed over 90% of the pancreas. Continue with the next image. Remarkably, a CT performed 6 months after surgery showed a normal pancr\\neas. This indicates that during surgery the differentiation between pancreatic necrosis and necrosis of the peripancreatic tissues is sometimes impossible. The limitations of imagin\\ng are summarized in the table. Central gland necrosis with large collections in the left retroperitoneum and lesser sac (ANC's)\\nCentral gland necrosis:\\nCentral gland necrosis is a specific form of necrotizing pancreatitis, representing full thickness necrosis between the pancreatic head and tail and is nearly always associated with\\n disruption of the pancreatic duct. This leads to persistent collections as the viable pancreatic tail continues to secrete pancreatic juices. These collections mayreact poorly to e\\nndoscopic or percutaneous drainage. Definitive treatment may require distal pancreatectomy or long-term endoscopic drainage.\\nReporting - PANCODE:\\nThe Pancode system is a checklist for the description of acute pancreatitis and its complications.\\nIntervention:\\nThe current management of acute pancreatitis is to be conservative for as long as possible. During the first two weeks patients with severe acute pancreatitis and multi-organ failur\\ne should be stabilized in the ICU. Interventions should be delayed for as long as possible. Many collections will remain sterile or resorb spontaneously. Allow for demarcation of co\\nllections, which takes about 4 weeks.\\nFNA and Drainage:\\nOnce the clinical condition of the patient deteriorates and the patient is febrile, fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be used to differentiate between sterile and infected collection\\ns. Important remarks concerning FNA: Important remarks concerning Drainage: Peripancreatic collections can be approached through the transhepatic (red arrow), transgastric (green ar\\nrow) or transabdominal (blue arrows) route, but the preferred approach is to stay in the retroperitoneal compartment (yellow arrows).

If you image a complete radial tear directly \\nalong the length of the tear you will see an absent or empty meniscus. These complete radial tears open up and give the impression that there is a part missing. However you will not\\n find a displaced meniscal fragment. It is simply separation of the meniscal parts.

The location of a meniscal tear is of importance \\nbecause tears in this vascular portion of the meniscus are more likely to heal spontaneously than tears in the avascular portion or white zone of the meniscus.\\nMeniscus within meniscus sign:\\nSometimes extensive triangular or wedge-shaped high signal intensity can be encountered that does not reach te surface of the meniscus. This is sometimes referred to as meniscus wit\\nhin meniscus sign. Since this meniscal abnormality does not reach the meniscal surface, it does not fullfill the criteria for a meniscal tear.

With meniscus extrusion, the meniscus is unable to resist hoop stresses and cannot shield the adjacent articular cartilage from excessive axial load. Over time,\\n this can lead to symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Tears of the posterior meniscal root can be easily missed because of inconsistent clinical symptoms and can be overlooked without \\nthorough arthroscopic examination.

The mechanism of injury is internal rotation and varus stress. On a radiograph it manifests as an elliptic bony fr\\nagment off the lateral proximal tibia (figure). A Segond fracture has a high association with a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (75-100%) and injuries of the medial and later\\nal menisci (66-70%).

It is the leading cause of death in this category of diseases, frequently presen\\nting as a complex cystic mass. The finding of an adnexal cyst causes considerable anxiety in women due to the fear of malignancy. However, the vast majority of adnexal cysts - even \\nin postmenopausal women - are benign. In this article we will focus on specific features of ovarian cysts that are helpful in making a differential diagnosis. We will present a road\\nmap for the diagnostic work-up and management of ovarian cystic masses, based on ultrasound and MRI findings. In Ovarian Cystic Masses II the imaging features of normal ovaries and \\nthe most common ovarian cystic masses will be presented, as well as several less common cystic lesions.\\nDiagnostic work-up:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 271}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"If a cystic pelvic mass is present, the first step is to find out if it is ovarian or non-ovarian in origin.\\n* Step 2 The next step is to determine if the lesion can be categorized as one of the common, benign ovarian masses (simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or mature cystic ter\\natoma), or is indeterminate.\\n* Step 3 To aid in selecting the proper work-up, the final step is to determine whether a patient falls into a low-risk category (i.e. premenopausal women without additional risk fa\\nctors) or a high-risk category (i.e. post-menopausal or premenopausal with additional risk factors). Based on these steps we can determine further management: ignore, follow-up with\\n US, further evaluation with MRI or excision.\\nRole of imaging:\\nRole of Ultrasound For characterization of ovarian masses, ultrasound is often the first-line method of choice, especially for distinguishing cystic from complex cystic-solid and so\\nlid lesions. Role of CT CT is useful for the N- and M-staging of proven malignant lesions. Role of MRI For complex lesions, primary evaluation with ultrasound is often followed by f\\nurther evaluation with MRI. Even with MRI it is often not possible to make an accurate diagnosis of neoplastic subtype. By using MRI as an adjunct to sonography a delay in the treat\\nment of potentially malignant ovarian lesions is prevented. This is not only beneficial to the small number of women who do have ovarian cancer, but also a proven cost-effective app\\nroach to the management of sonographically indeterminate adnexal lesions.\\nOvarian or non-ovarian:\\nIf a cystic adnexal mass is present and you suspect an ovarian origin, the first thing to do is try to identify the ovaries. If the gonadal vessels lead to the lesion with no separa\\ntely identifiable normal ovaries, then most likely you are dealing with an ovarian lesion. If both ovaries are separately identifiable from the lesion, you are dealing with a non-ov\\narian cystic lesion, or a lesion that mimics a cystic mass. The next step would be to check if there is uni- or bilateral disease and to look for any solid components that may indic\\nate malignancy. Also look for secondary findings like ascites, enlarged lymph nodes and peritoneal deposits. The table shows a differential diagnosis for possible cystic ovarian mas\\nses. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images A helpful tool to identify the ovaries is to follow the ovarian veins caudally. Scroll through the CT-images and follow the right ovarian ve\\nin from where it joins the inferior vena cava, and the left ovarian vein where it joins the left renal vein, until you identify the ovaries.\\nUltrasound pattern recognition:\\nPattern recognition on ultrasound often allows a fairly confident diagnosis of common cystic ovarian masses. This means that in many cases the diagnostic work-up is based on determi\\nning the probability that we are dealing with a lesion which falls into the category of a simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or a mature cystic teratoma (commonly referred \\nto as a dermoid cyst). Most other cystic lesions are indeterminate and therefore possibly malignant. These therefore require further evaluation, either with MRI or surgical excision\\n.\\nSimple cyst:\\nUS findings that allow a confident diagnosis of a simple ovarian cyst are: The US-image shows two simple cysts in the right ovary with ovarian stroma in between. The surrounding ves\\nsels are normal and there are no vascularized septations. These were simple follicular cysts in a premenopausal woman. Differential diagnosis Most simple cysts are functional cysts,\\n usually follicular cysts. \\nThey are commonly seen in premenopausal women, but functional cysts also still do occur in postmenopausal women. Some simple cysts may turn out to be paraovarian or paratubal cysts.\\n A hydrosalpinx may also mimic an ovarian cyst. Cystadenomas can also present as simple cysts, but they usually present as a large cyst in a postmenopausal woman. In a large cancer \\nscreening study from 1987 to 2002 including 15,106 women of 50 years or older, 2763 women (18%) were diagnosed with a unilocular ovarian cyst. None of these isolated unilocular cyst\\ns turned out to be ovarian cancer (4). In women of reproductive age, cysts up to 3 cm are a normal physiologic finding. \\nThese simple physiologic cysts do not need to be described in the imaging report and do not require follow-up (1). Cysts up to 7 cm in both pre- and postmenopausal woman are almost \\ncertainly benign. Cysts larger than 7 cm may be difficult to assess completely with US and therefore further imaging with MR or surgical evaluation should be considered. Normal ovar\\nies Functional cysts Hemorrhagic cyst\\nHemorrhagic ovarian cyst - HOC:\\nWhen a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. US findings that allow a confident diagnosis of a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst ar\\ne: In premenopausal women short term follow-up is recommended in hemorrhagic cysts > 5 cm. The same follow-up is recommended in early postmenopausal women who have a cyst with all t\\nhe characteristics of a HOC\\nLarger hemorrhagic cysts in the early menopause and any hemorrhagic cyst in the late menopause should be considered possibly neoplastic and MRI or surgical evaluation should be cons\\nidered. Hemorrhagic cyst with a clot mimicking a neoplasm. Notice absence of flow and good through-transmission (arrow) Differential diagnosis When hemorrhagic cysts present with di\\nffuse low-level echoes, their appearance can be similar to that of endometriomas. In the acute phase a hemorrhagic cyst may be completely filled with low-level echoes, simulating a \\nsolid mass (5). Clot in a hemorrhagic cyst may occasionally mimic a solid nodule in a neoplasm. Clot, however, often has concave borders due to retraction, while a true mural nodule\\n has outwardly convex borders. In both cases there will be no internal flow at Doppler US and there will be good through-transmission. Hemorrhagic cysts typically resolve within 8 w\\neeks. The ultrasound image shows multiple simple and one complex right ovarian cyst, with diffuse low-level echos and absence of flow on Doppler US. Note that there is good through-\\ntransmission, also through the complex cyst (blue arrow). On the T1 with fatsat the lesion remains bright, ruling out a fatty lesion. After Gd administration there is no enhancement\\n, confirming that this is a cystic hemorrhagic lesion, most likely a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, although your differential may include an endometrioma. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst\\nEndometrioma:\\nUS findings that allow a confident diagnosis of an endometrioma are: In women of any age, probable endometriomas require initial 6-12 week follow-up to rule out a hemorrhagic cyst. \\nUntil surgically removed, endometriomas require follow-up with ultrasound, for example on a yearly basis. This image from a vaginal ultrasound shows a large hypoechoic, cystic lesio\\nn with diffuse low-level echoes and two small echogenic foci. These have been postulated to be cholesterol deposits, but may also constitute small blood clots or debris. It is impor\\ntant to differentiate these echogenic foci from true wall nodules. Finding these echogenic foci makes the diagnosis of an endometrioma very likely. Endometrioma\\nMature cystic teratoma:\\nUS findings that are characteristic of a mature cystic teratoma are: Shown are transvaginal ultrasound images of two patients that demonstrate the 'tip-of-the-iceberg' sign: acousti\\nc shadowing from the hyperechoic part of the dermoid cyst (arrow). When misinterpreted as bowel gas, the lesion may be overlooked. Mature cystic teratoma\\nAny other cyst - possible neoplasm:\\nAll other cystic lesions are regarded as possibly neoplastic and therefore possibly malignant. Surgical resection is needed by an oncologic gynaecologist, who may request prior imag\\ning-based staging.

Benign cystic ovarian neoplasms Malignant cystic ovarian neoplasms\\nLow-risk or High-risk:\\nOnce we have determined a cystic ovarian lesion is either a probable simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or mature cystic teratoma, or is indeterminate, the next step is to \\nplace the patient in a low-risk or high-risk group (table). The final decision to ignore, follow or excise a cystic ovarian lesion is based on: That said, the great majority of cyst\\nic ovarian lesions is benign. While the risk of malignancy does increase with age, even in post-menopausal women the risk of malignancy in a simple ovarian cyst\\nAlthough complex ovarian cysts in post-menopausal women are also most often benign, they do require further work-up, because of the chance of malignancy.\\n'the Roadmap':\\nThe natural history of incidentally detected pelvic masses with benign US morpgology is not known and therefore the optimal management is also unknown. The roadmap is based on the 2\\n010 Consensus Guidelines published in (1) and (2) and on the findings in (3) and (4). The mentioned size cut-offs and follow-up frequencies are accepted practices but not ironclad r\\nules. Local guidelines may differ based on the clinical scenario and institutional practice preferences. Many of the imaging criteria described in this article are the same for ultr\\nasound, CT and MRI, although of course not every feature is equally detectable on all modalities. Risk factors Age is the most important risk factor for all women. Lesions in pre-me\\nnopausal and post-menopausal women are managed differently. Several other factors (see table) may place a woman in a higher risk category. Concordantly, the roadmap shows two pathwa\\nys, one for lower-risk and one for higher-risk patients.\\nMRI protocol - which sequences, and why:\\nMRI protocol There are many possible 'Pelvic/Ovarian mass' protocols. The basic building blocks are simple and are the same for all protocols: A very short protocol may consist of o\\nnly 1, 2 and 3 (e.g., when the request is to 'rule out an ovarian mass'). Many radiologists prefer a slightly more comprehensive protocol including 4, and often 5. When the clinical\\n setting is characterization or staging of a known ovarian lesion, 4 (or CT) and 5 should always be included. The role of diffusion-weighted MRI is yet to be determined, but DWI is \\na useful aid in the detection of lymph nodes, tumors and peritoneal deposits. \\nFor the purpose of detection, the DW images are sometimes fused with (superimposed on) anatomical T2W images. \\nDWI cannot discriminate benign from metastatic lymph nodes. Further differences in protocols all arise as variations on this simple theme. For example:\\n* T2W images in more than 2 planes, or obliquely angled orthogonal to the anatomic structure of interest, are often useful for cervical or uterine-body pathology.:\\nMR imaging is a valuable adjunct to US, as it allows identification of blood products within hemorrhagic masses that may mimic solid tumor at US. Fat-suppressed T1-weighted MR image\\ns may reveal small amounts of fat, which allows the diagnosis of a mature teratoma ('dermoid'). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging depicts features of malignancy such as enhan\\ncing mural nodules and/or enhancing solid areas with or without necrosis (3). These MR images show a lesion with high signal on T1. This indicates either blood, other high protein c\\nontent or fat. On the image with fat-saturation there is suppression of the signal. This means that we are dealing with a fat-containig lesion, i.e. a mature cystic teratoma. The US\\n image shows an echogenic lesion. The corresponding lesion has a high signal on the T1-weighted MR image.\\nThis indicates either blood, high protein or fat. On the image with fat-saturation there is no suppression of the signal. This means that we are dealing with a blood-containig lesio\\nn, i.e. most likely a hemorrhagic cyst. by Deborah Levine et al September 2010 Radiology, 256, 943-954.\\n2.

This m\\nay be challenging, because the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen includes a wide spectrum of disorders, ranging from life-threatening diseases to benign self-limiting condi\\ntions (Table 1). Indicated management may vary from emergency surgery to reassurance of the patient and misdiagnosis may easily result in delayed necessary treatment or unnecessary \\nsurgery. Sonography and CT enable an accurate and rapid triage of patients with an acute abdomen. We present practical guidelines on the radiological approach of these patients. Int\\neractive cases are presented in the menubar to test your knowledge.\\nRadiological strategy:\\nTable 1. Common causes of acute abdomen from life-threatening to self-limiting. Before you perform an examination, obtain relevant information from the referring clinician. Don't le\\nt the clinician simply 'order' a sonogram or CT, but discuss the patient's age and posture, laboratory results and the number one clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Base\\nd on that information and your own degree of confidence with the modalities decide for yourself whether to perform sonography or CT.

In general the diagnostic accuracy of CT is higher than sonograph\\ny. In patients with inconclusive US-results, CT can serve as an adjunct to sonography, and vice versa. We advocate the following two-step radiological approach of an acute abdomen. \\nConfirm or exclude the most common disease Screen for general signs of pathology You have to be familiar with all the diagnoses listed in Table 1 to be able to recognize them.\\nClinics, laboratory, and plain abdominal film:\\nThe clinical presentation of patients with an acute abdomen is often nonspecific. Both surgical and nonsurgical diseases may present with a similar clinical history and symptoms. La\\nboratory findings (leucocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP) are equally nonconclusive. Findings may be normal in patients who need emergency surgery (such as appendicit\\nis) and may be abnormal in patients without a surgical disease (like salpingitis). A plain abdominal film has a limited value in the evaluation of abdominal pain. A normal film does\\n not exclude an ileus or other pathology and may falsely reassure the clinician. LEFT: Plain abdominal film in a patient with an acute abdomen, showing no abnormalities. RIGHT: Subs\\nequent CT shows distended small bowel loops (arrowheads) that are not seen on plain abdominal film because they are filled with fluid only and do not contain intraluminal air. An il\\neus may not be appreciated on a plain abdominal film if bowel loops are filled with fluid only without intraluminal air (figure). Alternatively if a plain abdominal film does indica\\nte an ileus than sonography or CT are usually needed to identify its cause. Thus, a plain abdominal film is seldomly useful, with the exception of detection of kidney stones or a pn\\neumoperitoneum. For all other indications use sonography or CT.\\nConfirm or exclude the most common disease:\\nMany disorders may cause an acute abdomen, but fortunately only a few of these are common and clinically important. Focus on confirming or excluding these frequent disorders:\\nRLQ : Appendicitis:\\nPain in the RLQ, regardless of any other symptom or laboratory results, should be considered to be appendicitis until proven otherwise. If you are unable to find the appendix you ca\\nnnot rule out the diagnosis of appendicitis unless a good alternative diagnosis is found. If you do not find the appendix and there is no altermative diagnosis call the results of t\\nhe examination indeterminate. Do not call it:' no appendicitis'. Normal appendix : Longitudinal (A) sonogram depicts a blind-ending tubular structure (arrowheads) with 'gut-signatur\\ne', with a maximum outer diameter of 6 mm, with noninflamed surrounding fat. On an axial view (B) the appendix can be compressed crossing the iliac vessels. Normal Appendix. Your fi\\nrst task is to identify the appendix. At sonography and CT the appendix is seen as a blind-ending nonperistaltic tubular structure arising from the base of the cecum. Do not mistake\\n a small bowel loop for the appendix. Secondly determine if the appendix is normal or inflamed. The outer-to-outer diameter of the appendix is the most important imaging criterium. \\nAlthough an overlap of appendiceal diameters in normal and inflamed appendices can incidentally be found, a threshold value of 6-7 mm is generally used. Normal appendix: CT shows an\\n air-containing non-distended appendix (arrowheads), with homogeneous low-density periappendiceal fat. A normal appendix has a maximum diameter of 6 mm, is surrounded by homogeneous\\n non-inflamed fat, is compressible and often contains intraluminal gas. Inflamed appendix at sonography. Longitudinal (A) and transverse (B) cross-section show a distended noncompre\\nssible appendix, surrounded bij hyperechoic inflamed fat (arrowheads). Inflamed Appendix An inflamed appendix has a diameter larger than 6 mm, and is usually surrounded by inflamed \\nfat. The presence of a fecolith or hypervascularity on power Doppler strongly supports inflammation. Inflamed appendix at CT. The appendix (arrows) is fluid-filled and distended wit\\nh periappendiceal fat-stranding. CT depicts an inflamed appendix as a fluid-filled blind-ending tubular structure surrounded by fat-stranding. In the case on the left a hyper-attenu\\nating wall is seen on the enhanced CT. In patients who lack intra-abdominal fat the use of iv. contrast can be helpfull in depicting the inflamed appendix. Sigmoid diverticulitis at\\n sonography. A hypoechoic thickened diverticulum is surrounded by hyperechoic inflamed fat (arrows).\\nLLQ : Diverticulitis:\\nIf the pain is located in the LLQ your main concern is sigmoid diverticulitis. In diverticulitis sonography and CT show diverticulosis with segmental colonic wall thickening and inf\\nlammatory changes in the\\nfat surrounding a diverticulum. Uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis. Fat stranding and focal thickening of the colonic wall in an area with diverticula. No abscess formation. Compl\\nications of diverticulitis such as abscess formation or perforation, can best be excluded with CT. LEFT: Sigmoid diverticulitis. Diverticulum (arrow) is surrounded by hyperattenuati\\nng fat. The sigmoid wall is thickened. RIGHT: Sigmoid carcinoma with limited fat stranding. An important pitfall is colon cancer, which may present with similar imaging features, es\\npecially when the colon cancer is surrounded by fat stranding due to invasive groth, desmoplastic reaction or inflammation. Frequently it is not possible to reliably distinguish div\\nerticulitis from colon cancer and therefore we routinely include colon cancer in the differential diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis.\\nRUQ : Cholecystitis:\\nCholecystitis occurs when a calculus obstructs the cystic duct. The trapped bile causes inflammation of the gallbladder wall. As gallstones are often occult on CT, sonography is the\\n preferred imaging method for the evaluation of cholecystitis, also allowing assesment of the compressiblity of the gallbladder. The diagnosis of a hydropic galbladder is solely mad\\ne on the non-compressability of the galbladder. Do not rely on measurements. Some galbladders happen to be small and others are large. Longitudinal and transverse US show thickened \\ngallbladder wall. The gallbladder is noncompressible ('hydropic') and causes an impression in the anterior abdominal wall (arrowheads). The imaging appearance of cholecystis consist\\ns of an enlarged hydropic (meaning non-compressible) gallbladder with a thickened wall in the region of maximum tenderness (the so-called 'Murphy sign') Cholecystitis at CT. The gal\\nlbladder is enlarged with edematous thickening of its wall (arrowhead), and some regional fat-stranding can be found. The inflamed gallbladder usually contains stones or sludge, whe\\nreas the obstructing calculus itself may or may not be identified because it is located deep within the galbladder neck or cystic duct. The gallbladder may be surrounded by inflamed\\n fat, but on sonography this frequently is not seen, while CT sometimes does show fat-stranding. Potential pitfalls are pancreatitis, hepatitis or right-sided heart failure, which a\\nll may lead to thickening of the gallbladder wall without cholecystitis. Therefore be certain that hydropic obstruction of the gallbladder is present before assigning the diagnosis \\nof cholecystitis. Pain in LUQ An acute abdomen with LUQ pain is rare. Its most common cause is gastric pathology in which radiological imaging plays a minor role.\\nScreen for general signs of pathology:\\nAfter excluding these frequent disorders, search for signs of any other pathology, by systematically screening the whole abdomen. Look for inflamed fat, bowel wall thickening, ileus\\n, ascites and free air. Inflamed fat at sonography. Extended-view of the ventral abdomen depicting an area of hyperechoic noncompressible inflamed fat in the omentum (red arrows).

Unenhanced CT depicts an area of fatty tissue with slightly increased density \\n(arrowheads), in the right-upper quadrant. Compare this to normal low-density subcutaneous fat. Diagnosis: omental infarction. Inflamed fat is shown as fat-stranding at CT. Inflamed\\n fat usefully points out where and what the problem is. As a rule, the organ or structure in the centre or nearest to the inflamed fat is the cause of the inflammation. ![Diffuse th\\nickening of bowel wall in a patient with colitis.](/assets/acute-abdomen-practical-approach/a5097976c20727_US-darmwandverdikking-(coli.jpg) Diffuse thickening of bowel wall in a pat\\nient with colitis.\\nBowel wall thickening:\\nThickening of bowel wall indicates inflammation or tumor, and has an extensive differential diagnosis.

Obstruction was due to adhesions Small bow\\nel obstruction (SBO) accounts for approximately 4% of all patients presenting with an acute abdomen. The diagnosis of SBO is made when you see dilated small bowel and collapsed smal\\nl bowel loops. If obstruction is present, try to identify its cause and location (adhesion, tumor, volvulus, intussusception, inguinal hernia). Adhesions account for 60-80% of all c\\nases and are the likely cause when a smooth transition from dilated to collapsed small-bowel loops is noted. The 'Small Bowel Feces Sign' (SBFS) is a very useful sign as it is seen \\nat the zone of transition thus facilitating identification of the cause of the obstruction. The SBFS has been defined as gas and particulate material within a dilated small-bowel lo\\nop that simulates the appearance of feces. Scroll through the images on the left to see the small bowel feces sign indicating the site of obstruction. Alternatively, an ileus withou\\nt any normal bowel loops strongly suggests a paralytic cause. This is usually a response to general peritonitis, wich may have many possible causes of the inflammation. Clinically a\\nppendicitis. US only showed a little bit of ascites.

This diagnosis ca\\nn only be made confidently when a normal appendix is found, because adenopathy also frequently occurs with appendicitis.\\nKey finding: Lymphadenopathy with a normal appendix and normal mesenteric fat.

In contrast to sigmoid diverticula,\\n right-sided colonic diverticula are usually true diverticula, that is, outpouchings of the colonic wall containing all layers of the wall.

DRE provides a dynamic assessment of the act of defecation by recording th\\ne rectal expulsion of a barium paste that approximates the consistency of feces. DRE provides qualitative and quantitative information on the function of anorectal and pelvic floor \\nfunction, and the effectiveness of the anal sphincter and rectal evacuation. by Tjeerd Wiersma\\nDynamic Rectal Examination:\\nThe commode needs to be radiolucent and safely attached to a fluoroscopic table\\nIndications:\\nIndications for dynamic rectal examination are: LEFT: Pathology is suspected because of a great distance between rectum and vagina. No oral contrast had been given. RIGHT: After ing\\nestion of liquid barium contrast a large enterocele is seen.\\nTechnique:\\nTwo hours prior to the examination the patient ingests 135 ml of liquid barium contrast to opacify the small bowel (figure). Rectal contrast can be administered without rectal prepa\\nration.\\nThe ideal rectal contrast has to simulate stool in weight and consistency.\\nIn our experience, Evacu-Paste? 100 (E-Z-EM Inc., Westbury, NY, USA) is a convenient paste. The barium paste is injected until the patient experiences discomfort due to rectal diste\\nnsion or until about 250 ml has been instilled. In females the vagina is coated with 30 ml amidotrizoic acid 50% solution gel.\\nIt is applied by means of a syringe with a soft pediatric enema tip. The use of tampons and gauzes soaked in barium should be avoided, because they can impaire pelvic-function. Afte\\nr sufficient filling of the rectum, the patient is asked to sit on a special commode.\\nThe fluoroscopic screening of the rectum and the function of the pelvic musculature and the continence mechanism is assessed.\\nThe duration of examination is about 15 minutes.\\nImaging:\\nRest, start of defecation and end of defecation Examinations includes a number of standard images and maneuvers. Initially the patient is screened in lateral projection at rest with\\nout consciously contracting any pelvic muscles and a spot film is taken. The patient then maximally contracts the pelvic floor muscles ('squeeze') which results in a more tense musc\\nular diaphragm and in elevation of the entire pelvic floor a spot film or video is taken. Finally the patient is asked to empty the rectum as completely as possible.\\nAn estimate of the completeness of defecation and measurement of pelvic floor descent can be made. Morphological abnormalities are usually discernible during this part of procedure.\\n During straining a S-shaped rectum may simulate intussusception in lateral projection. It is important that the patient is sitting during the procedure, since much of physiological\\n nature of defecation is lost when the patient is lying down. Additional oblique or anteroposterior (AP) views should be taken of any unexplained radiographic feature seen on the la\\nteral views (figure).

Dynamic recording of the fluoroscopic images enables the examiner to follow the movements of the rectum, facilitating \\nthe diagnosis of rectocele, enterocele and intussusception, as well as to evaluate the function of the anal sphincter. Digitization of fluoroscopic image or digital substraction may\\n facilitate direct screen measurements of angles. Some patients give a history of various unusual maneuvers (digital support of vagina or perineum) to aid defecation. Allowing the p\\natients to demonstrate the maneuvers during the examination may facilitate the radiological documentation of the mode of action. Since a number of treatment methods, which successfu\\nlly can restore the dynamics of rectal evacuation, have been developed speed and completeness of rectal emptying is clinically important and therefore need to be recorded.\\nNormal findings:\\nAt rest (left), during defecation (middle) and at the end of defecation (right) At rest: distance between vagina and ventral rectal wall\\nFindings of abnormalities:\\nRectocele:\\nA rectocele can be defined as an anterior or posterior bulge of the rectal wall\\nbeyond the extrapolated line of the wall (Fig. 1).

Barium trapping in the rectocele is considered to be important in explaining the repeated\\nsensation of rectal fullness after defecation. In our own series no correlation could be found between the size of the rectocele and the symptoms, so we do not grade rectoceles anym\\nore. It has been suggested that rectoceles may be the result of repeated straining secondary\\nto a preexisting disorder (f.e. spastic pelvic floor syndrome) of defecation rather than to\\nthe rectocele being the primary cause of the obstructive symptoms. This may also explain why rectocele repair is often unsuccessful in relieving symptoms.\\nWhen surgical repair of a rectocele detected at physical examination is considered, preoperative\\nDRE should be performed to exclude other causes of obstructed defecation (intussusception or enterocele). DRE demonstration of a rectal intussusception may change the operative proc\\nedure e.g. to\\ncorrect the intussusception instead of the rectocele. In patients with an anterior rectocele, in whom other causes of obstructed defecation are ruled out, surgical rectocele repair \\nshould be considered. In our opinion there are two indications for operating on an anterior rectocele. First: if a patient needs vaginal digital support to facilitate defecation. Se\\ncond: in cases of disturbed sexual intercourse. Posterior rectoceles are incidental findings and not related to clinical symptoms (figure). 1 : Intra-rectal intussusception, 2 : Int\\nra-anal intussusception, 3 : Extra-anal intussusception (rectal prolapse)\\nIntussusception:\\nIntussusception of the rectum is an invagination of the rectal wall, which begins as a circular fold 6 to 8 cm up in the rectum and develops into a condition in which the entire rec\\ntal wall folds in towards the rectal lumen. The intussusception can be intra-rectal, intra-anal or finally extra-anal as a rectal prolapse (figure). In connection with straining thi\\ns folding inwards progresses and deepens to form a ring pocket, so that it finally fills the entire ampulla. This may reach down to, into or through the anal canal (rectal prolapse)\\n. A minimal folding inwards which disappears after the bolus has passed is probably caused by a transient prolapse of the rectal wall and should not be considered pathological. The \\nmost common complaint of the patient with intussusception is: Difficulty in bowel emptying. Pain, blood loss upon defecation Incontinence of gas and/or feces Mucus discharge which o\\nften leads to pruritis ani. Upon hard straining the obstructive sensation increases.\\nIn order to empty their bowels many patients have to extract the feces manually, while others have to exert pressure with their hands about the anus and perineum.\\nEnemas may be ineffective. S-shaped rectum which simulates an intussuseption on the lateral view (same case as above). Rectal prolapse (extra-anal intussusception) may be transient \\nand difficult to reproduce, while intrarectal intussusception may be overlooked on clinical examination and is seldom revealed by proctoscopy. When the intussusception reaches into \\nthe anal canal it leads to maximal dilatation. These patients often complain of fecal incontinence in between defecation while they have the feeling of an obstacle or incomplete emp\\ntying during defecation. A longstanding intussusception may lead to the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. There is seldom doubt regarding the clinical diagnosis of complete rectal pro\\nlapse. Lesser grades of prolapse, however, can present a variety of difficulties. Oblique or anteroposterior (AP) views can be necessary too, due to the AP view provides a more reli\\nable image of intra-anal intussusception than the standard lateral view during evacuation.\\nEnterocele:\\nAn enterocele is a peritoneal sac that has herniated downwards along the ventral rectal wall. As DRE is routinely performed with small bowel and vaginal contrast, loops of small bow\\nel are then seen to fill the gap between the vagina and the rectum. Grade 1 is maximally reaching down to the distal half of the vagina, and partial or complete reduction of the rec\\ntal lumen. Grade 2 is as grade 1, but reaching down to the perineum. Grade 3 is protruding out of the anal canal to form a rectal prolapse. Normal findings at rest (left); during de\\nfecation there is a rectocele, that is pushed downward by an enterocele . Sometimes the enterocele is identified only at the end of the defecation, after repeated straining. An ente\\nrocele may be pressed into the direction of the introitus vaginae. If there is an associated rectocele, this can be pushed downward by the enterocele and finally evacuated (figure).\\n Clinically it can be difficult to diagnose an enterocele. Patients with previous pelvic surgery are predisposed to the formation of an enterocele. A sigmoidocele is seen between va\\ngina and rectum. In female patients with constipation there is a higher incidence of severe enteroceles in patients with a hysterectomy (22%) compared to the group without hysterect\\nomy (9%). Chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure may cause an enterocele with or without a previous pelvic operation. A sigmoidocele is a prolapse of redundant sigmoid colon\\n into a deep pouch of Douglas.\\nIt is less common than an enterocele. Schematic lateral view on the levator ani and external sphincter ani muscles\\nSpastic pelvic floor syndrome:\\nOn the left a schematic lateral view on the levator ani and external sphincter ani muscles is shown. The puborectal muscle should be contracted at rest (sharp anorectal angle). Duri\\nng defecation the puborectal muscle should relax allowing passage of the stool. LEFT: Hypertonic sphincter (during defecation).RIGHT: Impression of hypertonic puborectal muscle (non\\n-relaxing during defecation). Spastic pelvic floor syndrome denotes a persistent contraction of the pelvic floor muscles during defaecation. It represents a functional disorder of t\\nhe pelvic floor muscles causing an outlet obstruction. The question arises, however, whether persistent contraction is due to the conscious action of an embarrassed patient, thus on\\nly occurring during the investigation, or whether it really represents a functional disorder of the pelvic floor muscle resulting in outlet obstruction. The etiology is unknown.\\nPsychological factors may play a role. The anorectal angle (ARA) normally increases on straining as a result of relaxation of the puborectal muscle. The extent of increase may range\\n from 20? to 40?. In a small group of patients with impaired evacuation, DRE demonstrated either an unchanged or decreased ARA on straining or defecation, which findings frequently \\nresult from a persistent or paradoxical increase of the puborectal muscle impression. This appearance is often quite persistent and the evacuation may only be achieved after multipl\\ne attempts at straining and defecation.\\nNone:\\nNone:\\nUltrasound in Acute Abdomen:\\nJulien Puylaert\\nDepartment of Radiology, MCH Westeinde Hospital, The Hague, The Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2007-04-24 Multi-slice CT is increasingly replacing ultrasonography for the evaluation of patients with acute abdominal pain.\\nUltrasound however has specific advantages.

              " Document(page_content=\"Why perform ultrasonography when you have CT ?:\\nMulti-slice CT is increasingly replacing ultrasonography (US) for the evaluation of patients with acute abdominal pain CT has major advantages over US: it is extremely fast and its \\ntime burden is often less than that of a US examination (1-4). CT is not disturbed by gas and bone, while obesity is even an advantage. Most of all, CT is not operator-dependent and\\n can be reviewed by others, even at a distance. With all these advantages, it is not surprising that US is losing field in the evaluation of the acute abdomen. US however has some a\\ndvantages. Visualization of the normal appendix by CT in an obese patient and by US in a lean patient.\\nSpecific advantages of US:\\nThis is only true if the target organ can be approached closely, which requires either a thin patient or the use of graded compression. Realtime US allows to observe the effects of \\nValsalva manoeuvre. Intra-abdominal fat is pressed into the abdominal wall (arrow) through an epigastric hernia. Specific advantages of US (2) US can directly visualize blood flow a\\nnd pulsations, and it is also possible to appreciate the effects of respiration, Valsalva maneuver, gravity and compression. Realtime US allows to observe the effect of compression.\\n Compare the contracted normal ileum (left) with the relaxed, flattened ileum in the same patient a few seconds later (right) The latter is especially useful to judge whether organs\\n or tissues are soft or rigid. Real time US allows one to observe the effect of compression. On the far left a contracted normal ileum and next to it a relaxed flattened ileum a few\\n seconds later. US guided puncture of intraperitoneal fluid reveals purulent nature of the fluid in a patient with perforated appendicitis. Specific advantages of US (3) The advanta\\nge of US over CT is that it allows precise correlation of the US findings with the area of maximum tenderness or with a palpable mass with. Another advantage of US is its mobility a\\nnd flexibility: It can be done in the Emergency Ward, High Care Units and the Operating Room, and with the present generation of small, battery-assisted, hand-held units, in fact an\\nywhere. Information provided by the patient may lead to a specific search for a US finding, while, vice versa, certain US findings may lead to a specific question to the patient. Th\\nis interactive aspect is perhaps the greatest secret of a successful US examination. If performed in this way, US is much more than depicting abdominal organs. As the examination pr\\noceeds, it is possible to correlate the US findings with the clinical data, the laboratory results, other imaging studies and the information provided by the patient. Doing so, the \\nlong list of possible differential diagnoses will continuously narrow down until a definitive diagnosis is established, or at least, direction is given to subsequent imaging studies\\n. The point of maximum tenderness and a possible palpable mass, are correlated with the US findings and in case of free fluid, US guided puncture can be done (Figure).\\nWho does the US examination ?:\\nWorldwide, there is a large variation of who performs the US examination of the acute abdomen. US is done by technicians, general radiologists, radiologists specialized in US, abdom\\ninal radiologists, and all sorts of clinicians, urologists, gynecologists and even family doctors. The US examination performed as described above, requires a person with a thorough\\n medical background, knowledge of all possible causative conditions (urological, gynecological, gastrointestinal, vascular, etc.), and with a large expertise in US as well as in CT,\\n imaging guided puncture and other radiological imaging. There is no doubt that the person who meets these conditions best is the radiologist, and preferably a radiologist with spec\\nial interest in abdominal US and CT. Additional advantages of concentrating all primary, diagnostic abdominal US examinations within the Radiology Department are obvious: It guarant\\nees integrated imaging, constant quality, round-the-clock coverage, continuity, central archiving and accurate and early triage of patients with abdominal symptoms (6).\\nUS Technique:\\nNormal ileum and appendix during compression. Thin habitus of the patient and the application of compression allow the use of a 13.5 MHz transducer with a high image quality. US exa\\nmination in patients with acute abdominal pain requires a specific technique of graded compression. In this way fat and bowel are displaced or compressed. This eliminates the distur\\nbing influence of bowel gas and reduces the distance from the transducer to the appendix, allowing the use of a high frequency probe with better image quality (Figure). This techniq\\nue also allows assessing the rigidity of a structure by evaluating its reaction upon compression In order to avoid pain, the compression should be applied slowly and gently, similar\\n to the classic palpation of the abdomen. Acutely inflamed appendix in deep pelvic position. The appendix could only be visualized with the help of a transvaginal probe. The entire \\nabdomen is examined to exclude disease of gallbladder, pancreas, kidney, aorta, stomach, small and large bowel, appendix, uterus and ovaries. A moderately filled bladder allows bett\\ner survey of the distal ureters, and of uterus and ovaries in women; however, a full bladder does not allow proper graded compression. Transvaginal US may be used for gynecological \\nconditions but also for pelvic appendicitis, diverticulitis and Douglas abscesses. The 'mowing-the-lawn' technique. The peritoneal cavity is screened for bowel pathology with five t\\no six vertically oriented, overlapping lanes using a broad based, high frequency probe. We refer to this as 'mowing the lawn' (Figure). This form of screening is facilitated by the \\nuse of thin-liquid US-gel. Segmental colitis in Crohn's disease Bowel pathology is usually conspicuous, because the diseased and empty bowel has a thickened and hypoechoic wall, whi\\nch contrasts with the surrounding hyperechoic fatty tissue. On the left a patient with segmental colitis caused by Crohn's disease. The pathologic bowel segment is easily picked up \\nusing the 'mowing-the-lawn' technique.\\nAppendicitis:\\nThe typical appearance of an inflamed appendix is that of a concentrically layered, non-compressible sausage-like structure demonstrated in a fixed position at the site of maximum t\\nenderness (Figure). The average maximum diameter is 9 mms with a variation from 7 to 17 mms. In 30% intraluminal fecoliths are found actually obstructing the lumen. Six to 12 hours \\nafter the onset of symptoms, the inflammation progresses to the adjacent fat of the meso-appendix, which becomes larger, more hyperechoic and less compressible. Later on, this fatty\\n tissue will tend to increase in volume around the appendix: this represents mesentery and omentum, which have migrated towards the appendix in an attempt to wall-off the imminent p\\nerforation. Acute appendicitis. The inflamed appendix shows local disturbance of the layerstructure indicating local transmural progression of the infection. The surrounding inflame\\nd fat will probably effectively wall-off the imminent perforation. Slowly applied intermittent compression is the best way to identify the non-compressible inflamed fat (Figure). An\\n irregular, asymmetrical contour and loss of the layer structure of the appendix indicate perforation or imminent perforation. Vascularization of the appendiceal wall is either mark\\nedly increased or absent due to high intraluminal pressure with concomitant ischemic necrosis, however there is always increased vascularization in the directly surrounding fatty ti\\nssue . The presence of a generalized, adynamic ileus is suspect for perforated appendicitis, even if the inflamed appendix cannot be visualized. Inflamed appendix in unusual high po\\nsition in a patient with clinical signs of cholecystitis. Due to its abnormal position far from McBurney's point (McB), the appendix was drawn on the skin with a waterproof pencil. \\nThis influenced site, size and orientation of the incision and facilitated the appendectomy. A small quantity of free intraperitoneal fluid is aspecific. It may be present in both n\\non-perforated and perforated appendicitis as well as in many other conditions, both surgical and non-surgical. A large quantity of fluid in the presence of an inflamed appendix may \\nrepresent pus from perforated appendicitis and then is usually accompanied by paralytic ileus. Larger quantities of free fluid are also found in perforated peptic ulcer (note air an\\nd food particles) and gynecological conditions (puncture usually reveals blood). In most patients with appendicitis inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes can be demonstrated higher up in \\nthe mesenterial root. In case of an abnormal position of the inflamed appendix far from where the usual gridiron-incision is made, it is useful to indicate the location of the appen\\ndix on the skin of the patient with a waterproof marker. This may influence site, size and orientation of the incision. Spontaneous resolving appendicitis. LEFT: inflamed appendix w\\nith a dilated lumen and a diameter of 11mm.

Noncompressible, inflamed appendix (arrowheads) lies next to the normal well-\\ncompressable ileum. The lumen is dilated and the diameter is 11 by 13 mm. Note the fluid-debris level within the lumen.\\nSpontaneous resolving appendicitis:\\nIf the clinical symptoms rapidly subside despite the presence of an unequivocally inflamed appendix on US, one should consider the diagnosis of spontaneously resolving appendicitis.\\n These patients initially have the typical clinical signs of appendicitis, but within 12-48 hours after the onset of pain the clinical symptoms relatively abruptly subside, probably\\n due to relief of obstruction. On US follow up, the appendix usually decreases in size in the course of days. If the patient recalls similar previous attacks, immediate appendectomy\\n is advisable, even if the patient is again completely free of symptoms at that time. Histology in such cases will nevertheless- confirm acute inflammation. In case conservative man\\nagement is opted for, keep in mind that there is a recurrence rate of approximately 40 % (8). Resolution of an appendiceal phlegmon: At presentation, eight days later and finally an\\nother six weeks later.\\nAppendiceal mass:\\nPatients, who are admitted with considerable delay may present with a palpable mass and relatively mild peritonitis. In these patients, who usually have a high ESR, US shows a large\\n mass of non-compressible fat around the appendix, interspersed with echolucent streaks . These patients are diagnosed as 'appendiceal phlegmon' and are usually managed conservative\\nly because the surgeon knows that appendectomy in such cases is technically difficult or even impossible (9). On the left a 35-year old man with a 10-day history of abdominal pain i\\nn the right lower quadrant. At examination a palpable mass was found. There was no evidence of peritonitis. On the top image the US reveales a large noncompressable inflammatory mas\\ns consisting of the inflamed appendix, mesentery and omentum. Patient was treated conservatively. Follow up examination at 8 days and another 6 weeks later showed still some residua\\nl abnormalities. The patient was completely symptom free. There were no recurrent symptoms and the patient did not undergo operation. Appendiceal abscess containing fecolith next to\\n inflamed appendix (arrows). If next to the inflamed appendix, a fluidcollection is found, this is suggestive for an appendiceal abscess. The collection often contains air and is su\\nrrounded by inflamed non-compressible hyperechoic tissue representing omentum and mesentery as well as secondarily thickened neighboring bowel loops, attempting to seal-off the absc\\ness from the peritoneal cavity. If an appendiceal abscess is demonstrated and there is no frank peritonitis, percutaneous drainage is the treatment of choice. In stable patients who\\n have no fever and only mild pain, it can be even wise to await spontaneous drainage of the abscess to neighboring bowel. On the left an abscess cavity that contains a fecolith. Not\\ne the inflamed appendix (arrows) lying next to the abscess. Acute appendicitis with a small periappendiceal abscess.\\nBetter off with immediate surgery:\\nFinally, there are some patients with an appendiceal abscess who are better off with immediate surgery: this goes in general for children and for those patients with severe peritoni\\ntis, which indicates that the walling-off process is failing. Immediate surgery is also indicated for patients who have a small abscess with a history of only a few days of symptoms\\n, in whom appendectomy with evacuation of the abscess is usually technically easy (Figure). On the left a patient with a 4-day history of right lower quadrant pain. There was perito\\nnitis at physical examination. The sedimentation rate was 48mm/hour. Palpation was unreliable. Subsequent appendectomy with evacuation of the abscess was performed without technical\\n difficulties. Prior to percutaneous drainage, CT is necessary to delineate the extent of the abscess and to determine the safest access route. If expertise is available in US guide\\nd puncture, the combination US plus fluoroscopy has several advantages over CT guided drainage. It is rapid, allows continuous control, any angulation, and can be performed as a bed\\n-side procedure.\\nPitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis:\\nA false positive diagnosis can be made if the normal appendix is mistaken for an inflamed one. Not infrequently the normal appendix is larger than 7 mms, especially in children due \\nto lymphoid hyperplasia and in adults due to fecal impaction. Appendiceal compressibility, the absence of a Doppler signal and the absence of inflamed fat are the most important fea\\ntures in deciding if it is normal or inflamed. Mistaking a normal appendix for an inflamed one may also occur if there is secondary thickening of the appendix associated with cecal \\ncarcinoma. In the latter case, the appendiceal lumen is obstructed giving rise to sterile accumulation of mucus in the lumen.\\nThe patient often has remarkably mild symptoms and is managed conservatively under the erroneous diagnosis of an appendiceal phlegmon. If the underlying tumour is small and is not r\\necognized, this may lead to considerable delay in surgical treatment. The combination of a relatively large appendix with paradoxically mild and atypical symptoms should raise suspi\\ncion of underlying malignancy. Other conditions with secondary thickening of the appendix are perforated peptic ulcer, Crohn's disease and sigmoid diverticulitis. Pitfall. The infla\\nmed appendix, demonstrated in the longitudinal (left) and axial (right) plane, has a gas-filled lumen (arrowheads), making it difficult to identify.The sausage shape and the inflame\\nd fat are the clue to the diagnosis. Pitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis (2) A false negative ultrasound examination is mostly the result of overlooking the inflamed append\\nix. In experienced hands the inflamed appendix can be visualized in 90% of patients with acute appendicitis. Generalized peritonitis hampers graded compression which may account for\\n a lower score in patients with free appendiceal perforation. Also air-filled dilated bowel loops from adynamic ileus may hide the appendix from view. Air in the lumen can make it d\\nifficult to identify the inflamed appendix. Pitfall. Acute appendicitis, but appendix has a diameter of only 6.5mm. However there is inflamed fat and an increased Doppler signal ind\\nicating that it is acutely inflamed. Pitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis (3) Another pitfall is demonstration of the normal proximal part of the appendix while the distal i\\nnflamed tip is overlooked, because it is obscured by bowelgas. Rarely, the inflamed appendix has a maximal diameter of less than 7 mms. In those cases rigidity, hypervascularity and\\n the presence of inflamed fat must give the clue. On thr left a patient with acute pain in the right lower quadrant. The appendix has a diameter of only 6.5mm. However there is infl\\named fat and an increased Doppler signal indicating that it is acutely inflamed. Pitfall. Secondary thickening of the ileum by appendicitis. If the prominent ileum is appreciated, b\\nut the inflamed appendix (arrow) is overlooked, an erroneus diagnosis of Crohn's disease or infectious ileocolitis can be made. Pitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis (4) Anot\\nher pitfall is advanced appendicitis where there is secondary wall thickening of the ileum. Often the ileal thickening is more prominent and conspicuous on US than the underlying in\\nflamed appendix (Figure). If only the ileum is appreciated and the appendix is overlooked, an erroneous diagnosis of infectious\\nileocecitis or Crohn's disease can be made, leading to ill-advised surgical delay. Similarly, if in an adult patient enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are the sole US finding, one sho\\nuld be cautious to diagnose mesenteric lymphadenitis because these nodes could be secondarily enlarged due to acute\\nappendicitis, while the inflamed appendix is overlooked. If in a patient with appendicitis only the fecolith in the appendiceal base is visualized and the rest of the appendix is ov\\nerlooked, this may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis. Pitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis (5) Also, if in a woman a relatively large rightsided ovarian\\n cyst is found, this is not necessarily the cause of her symptoms and appendicitis should still be searched for. Finally, if in advanced appendicitis only the hyperechoic non-compre\\nssible inflamed fat of omentum and mesentery is visualized, and the inflamed appendix is overlooked, this may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of omental infarction or epiploic append\\nagitis (10,11). In patients with equivocal US findings, CT scan is indicated. A fortunate circumstance is that these are often obese patients.\\nIleocecal Crohns disease:\\nCrohn's ileitis with transmural inflammation and abscess formation. Patients with ileocecal Crohn's disease often have protracted and atypical symptoms causing marked diagnostic del\\nay.

Sonographically, there is marked mural thickening of th\\ne ileum, which shows decreased or no peristalsis and is not compressible. Classically, all layers are involved and layerstructure is often locally disturbed , the earliest sign bein\\ng echolucent changes in the submucosa. There is inflammation of the fatty mesentery and omentum, recognizable as hyperechoic, non-compressible tissue adjacent to the ileum. In the e\\ncholucent wall bright eccentric foci may indicate deep ulceration. Echolucent streaks within the hyperechoic tissue indicate liponecrotic tracts, which may herald fistulaformation (\\nFigure). Cecum and appendix may also show mural thickening. Mesenteric lymph nodes are often markedly enlarged, but hypovascular. In longstanding Crohn's disease, 'creeping fat' is \\nfound which is recognized as a large, moderately well-compressible fatty mass encompassing most of the circumference of the ileum and iso-echoic to normal fat. Eventually, there are\\n often US signs of prestenotic dilatation, abscess formation, or fistulaformation.\\nInfectious ileocolitis and Infectious ileocecitis:\\nInfectious ileocolitis is a bacterial infection of terminal ileum and colon which is characterized by diarrhea and abdominal pain. The most frequently cultured bacteria are Campylob\\nacter and Salmonella, and Yersinia. The infection is generally limited to the mucosa, is self-limiting and rarely poses diagnostic problems. There is an interesting variant of infec\\ntious ileocolitis in which the infection is mainly limited to the ileocecal area and is therefore has been coined infectious ileocecitis (14). It is usually caused by the same bacte\\nria and the importance of this variant is that its clinial symptoms are dominated by acute right lower abdominal pain, while diarrhea is absent or only mild. These symptoms masquera\\nde as the clinical signs of appendicitis and explain why infectious ileocecitis often leads to an unnecessary laparotomy. Infectious ileocecitis in a patient with clinical symptoms \\nof appendicitis. There is marked mucosal and submucosal wall thickening of ileum and cecum. The symptoms of Yersinia are often more protracted and then both the clinical symptoms an\\nd the US features may mimick those of Crohn's disease. The absence of a transmural component, the self-limiting course and of course positive stool cultures or serology will yield t\\nhe correct diagnosis. The frequency of infectious ileocecitis is fairly high and has a ratio of 1 to 8 compared to appendicitis (14).

The various micro-organisms have a slightly different pattern of affecting the ileocecal area (Figure).

Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Appendix was normal. This is an ill-defined entity, probably of viral origin, in which the mesenteric lymph nodes become i\\nnflamed and enlarged. It is a typical disease of childhood and is only rarely seen in young adults. It mimicks the clinical signs of appendicitis and may therefore lead to an unnece\\nssary appen?dectomy. The US findings are solely enlarged, hypervascular mesenteric lymph nodes. However if these are the only US findings in a symptomatic young adult, it is well po\\nssible that these nodes are in fact secondarily enlarged due to acute appendicitis and the inflamed appendix is overlooked.\\nCecal carcinoma:\\nCecal carcinoma. US reveals asymmetric, hypoechoic, circumferential wall thickening of the cecum (arrowheads) with narrowing of the lumen. There is one pathologically enlarged lymph\\n node. Patients with cecal carcinoma can present with acute or subacute abdominal symptoms, in several ways. The tumour may cause acute small bowel obstruction, the appendix may be \\ninvolved, the tumour may perforate and the tumour itself may cause direct pain. The often bulky nature of the tumour and the close proximity of the right colon to the abdominal wall\\n makes cecal carcinoma in most cases fairly conspicuous on US. The majority presents as a hypoechoic, solid, well-vascularized irregular and asymmetrical thickening of the cecal wal\\nl (Figure). In the proximity enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes can be found, and in most cases there is also some inflamed fat around the tumour. In a minority of cases the tumour is \\nof the scirrhous type, which is less easy to detect. The finding of livermetastases of course strongly supports the diagnosis of malignancy. Ingrowth of the tumour in the appendicea\\nl base only rarely causes a full-blown appendicitis, but rather will lead to mucinous dilatation of the appendiceal lumen. On US the enlarged appendix is often more conspicuous than\\n the underlying tumour and, since there is often a palpable mass and protracted symptoms, these patients are often misdiagnosed as to have an appendiceal phlegmon, leading to signif\\nicant surgical delay. A clue to the correct diagnosis is the discrepancy between the relatively mild and protracted symptoms of intermittent, nagging pain and the impressive size of\\n the appendix and the surrounding tissue. Another helpful sign are markedly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (short axial diameter > 12 mms). If CT is not helpful and both clinical s\\nymptoms and US abnormalities do not resolve within weeks, colonoscopy is indicated.\\nSigmoid diverticulitis:\\nNormal, empty sigmoid. Axial view during relaxation and compression with the transducer shows the colonic anatomy the best. Note the three teniae coli, visible as a focal thickening\\n of the muscularis layer. Note the separation of each tenia from the circular muscular layer by a thin, echogenic layer of connective tissue (arrowheads). The diagnosis of sigmoid d\\niverticulitis is often made on clinical grounds. In the classical case the patient presents with localized pain and guarding in the left lower abdomen, fever, leukocytosis and, late\\nr on, elevation of the sedimentation rate. However, the diagnosis is not always clear. On one hand the clinical signs may be so atypical that initially another diagnosis is consider\\ned, as urinary tract infection, renal colic, perforated peptic ulcer, adnexitis or, -in case of diverticulitis in a rightsided loop of sigmoid- appendicitis. On the other hand, the \\nclinician may think of sigmoid diverticulitis while in fact another condition is present, as sigmoid carcinoma, epiploic appendagitis, a gynecological or urological condition or eve\\nn a ruptured aortic aneurysm. In all of these cases, US may play a role by making the correct diagnosis at an early point in time. On US, the normal descending colon and upper part \\nof the sigmoid can reliably be identified in virtually all patients due to its consistent location laterally in the left paracolic gutter. The US appearance of the normal sigmoid is\\n variable. The lumen can be empty or filled with feces, and the sigmoid can be contracted or relaxed (Figure). Sigmoid diverticulosis in two asymptomatic patients. The fecalith-fill\\ned diverticula are recognized as strongly reflective, round structures casting an acoustic shadow and localized at the outer contour of the empty sigmoid. The thin wall of the diver\\nticulum, consisting of mucosa only, is not separately visible. A third factor influencing the aspect is compression by the transducer, which flattens the colon. The muscularis in di\\nverticulosis is often markedly thickened and fecolith-containing diverticula can easily be recognized, as large (4-12 mms), strongly reflective, round-ovoid structures casting an ac\\noustic shadow and localized on the outside of the contour of the contracted colon. If the sigmoid is filled with feces, the diverticula are hardly recognizable. On the left sigmoid \\ndiverticulosis in two asymptomatic patients.

              " Document(page_content=\" of the disease. In the earliest stage there is usually local wall thickening of the colon, at first without but later with local blurring of the layer structure. Around the fecolit\\nh there is hyperechoic, non-compressible tissue, which represents the inflamed mesentery and omentum trying to seal off the imminent perforation. This inflamed fat, which is best id\\nentified during gentle, intermittent compression with the transducer, is obligatory for the diagnosis of diverticulitis (15). On the left a schematic presentation of the benign, nat\\nural course of sigmoid diverticulitis as it is observed in 80 % of patients. In stage 0 the neck of the diverticulum becomes obstructed, followed by high intra-diverticular pressure\\n and an impaired defense system against the bacteria lodging within the fecolith. Surrounding inflamed fat represents mesentery and omentum attempting to wall-off the imminent perfo\\nration. In stage 1 there is development of a small paracolic abscess, successfully walled-off by mesentery and omentum. The fecolith usually disintegrates and the sigmoid wall is lo\\ncally weakened. LEFT: Evacuation of pus and residual fecal material through the weakened sigmoid wall into the colonic lumen. RIGHT: Residual abnormalities remain fairly long after \\nresolution of the symptoms. In over 80 % of patients, after one or two days, the pus and the fecolith evacuate towards the colonic lumen via local weakening of the colonic wall at t\\nhe level of the original diverticular neck. (Figure) . Correspondingly, the patient's symptoms resolve. Note that the residual inflammatory changes (stage R) may remain present for \\na long time after the evacuation, so the patient can be completely symptomfree when there are still considerable US visible abnormalities present. Sigmoid diverticulitis: Natural, b\\nenign course. On the left the natural, benign course of sigmoid diverticulitis. TOP: US reveals mural thickening of the sigmoid at the level of an inflamed diverticulum (arrow) cont\\naining a fecolith (stage 0).

Withi\\nn the fat, echolucent linear streaks (arrowheads) are visible. MIDDLE: One day later the patient feels slightly better. The fecolith cannot be recognized as such and the contents of\\n the diverticulum are bulging towards the sigmoid lumen, sign of impending evacuation. BOTTOM: Another two days later, the patient was almost symptomfree. Pus and fecal material hav\\ne completely evacuated to the sigmoid lumen, leaving an empty diverticulum (curved arrow). Paracolic abscess due to diverticulitis (transvaginal US) In about 20 % of patients, diver\\nticulitis takes a complicated course. Free perforation without any sealing-off by mesentery or omentum, is relatively rare. Spill of fecal material and/or pus to the peritoneal cavi\\nty quickly leads to severe peritonitis rendering laparotomy inevitable. Even in case of a larger diverticular abscess (> 2.5 cms) spontaneous evacuation to the colonic lumen remains\\n the rule (Figure). On the left a paracolic abscess due to diverticulitis, effectively walled-off by large masses of inflamed fat, representing mesentery and omentum. The abscess ev\\nentually evacuated completely, and the patient recovered without surgery. Schematic presentation of the natural evolution of sigmoid diverticulitis, once a paracolic abscess has dev\\neloped. In some patients however the abscess may evacuate in a less favourable direction (Figure). In the first place, it may find its way to neighbouring diverticula, thus giving r\\nise to more longitudinally oriented abscesses undermining the colonic wall. These abscesses tend to heal badly and often lead to recurrent inflammation with stenosis eventually requ\\niring elective surgery. In rare cases the abscess breaks through to the peritoneal cavity which may lead to diffuse peritonitis or to secondary abscessformation. If a diverticular a\\nbscess evacuates into bladder or vagina, a fistula may result. On the left a schematic presentation of the natural evolution of sigmoid diverticulitis, once a paracolic abscess has \\ndeveloped. The most frequent and most favourable pathway is evacuation to the sigmoid lumen. Less favourable is breakthrough to neighboring diverticula (D), giving rise to persisten\\nt, longitudinal, cuff-like abscesses. Even worse is the formation of secondary abscesses (A), and eventual perforation to the peritoneal cavity (P). Finally, evacuation to bladder (\\nB), vagina (V) and through the skin will lead to fistulaformation.

Percutan\\neous drainage of a large diverticular abscess is indicated in case of persistent spiking fever, however it is only rarely needed. The presence of a persistent, large paracolic absce\\nss should always raise the suspicion of underlying malignancy.\\nRight sided colonic diverticulitis:\\nRightsided colonic diverticulitis in many respects differs from sigmoid diverticulitis. Diverticula of the right colon are usually congenital, solitary, true diverticula containing \\nall bowel layers. The fecoliths within these diverticula are larger, the diverticular neck is wider and there is no hypertrophy of the muscularis of the right colonic wall. Understa\\nndably, right colonic diverticulitis, which can occur at any age, almost invariably has a favourable course and never leads to free perforation with peritonitis or large abscesses. \\nAlthough relatively rare, it is crucial to make a correct diagnosis, since the clinical symptoms of acute RLQ pain may lead to an unnecessary operation for suspected appendicitis. I\\nn 40% of patients it even leads to a right hemicolectomy because the surgeon during the operation assumes he is dealing with a colonic malignancy. Although much more frequent in Asi\\nans, the diagnosis in the Western world is not rare: in a recent study one case of right colonic diverticulitis is seen for every 15 cases of sigmoid diverticulitis, and for every 3\\n0 cases of appendicitis [Oudenhoven]. US, if necessary complemented by CT, has characteristic features and prevents unnecessary surgery for this benign and self-limiting condition. \\nFor proper understan?ding of the US images, it is vital to realize the dynamic sequence of the inflammatory process, where each stage of the disease has its own US image [Oudenhoven\\n]. A dangerous pitfall is to mistake a fecolith in the base of an inflamed appendix for a case of cecal diverticu?li?tis.\\nPerforated Peptic Ulcer:\\nLEFT: In the right upper quadrant wall thickening of the duodenal bulb is found.

RIGHT: In the right lower quadrant a large amount of debris-like peritoneal fluid is found. The findi\\nng of pneumoperitoneum on a standing chest X-ray in combination with severe acute upper abdominal pain, is strongly suggestive for perforated peptic ulcer. A laparotomy will usually\\n follow without additional imaging. In some cases however, symptoms of a perforated ulcer may be atypical and mimic those of appendicitis, in which case no chest X-ray is made. In o\\nther cases of perforated ulcer free air is not present or not detectable. In all those cases, US and CT may be of help.

We will discuss the following subj\\nects: Short overview of neurodegenerative disorders which may be associated with dementia Introduction.\\nIntroduction.:\\nCoronal image of the hippocampus. The role of neuroimaging in dementia nowadays extends beyond its traditional role of excluding neurosurgical lesions. Radiological findings may sup\\nport the diagnosis of specific neurodegenerative disorders and sometimes radiological findings are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. It is a challenge for neuroimaging to contribu\\nte to the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis includes recognition of pre-dementia conditions, such as mild cognitive impairme\\nnt (MCI). In addition, early diagnosis allows early treatment using currently available therapies or new therapies in the future. Neuroimaging may also be used to assess disease pro\\ngression and is adopted in current trials investigating MCI and AD. The coronal image shows the hippocampus, the main structure involved in many forms of dementia.\\nAssessment of MR in Dementia:\\n* Lewy = Dementia with Lewy bodies An MR-study of a patient suspected of having dementia must be assessed in a standardized way. First of all, treatable diseases like subdural hemat\\nomas, tumors and hydrocephalus need to be excluded. Next we should look for signs of specific dementias such as: So when we study the MR images we should score in a systematic way f\\nor global atrophy, focal atrophy and for vascular disease (i.e. infarcts, white matter lesions, lacunes). When we study the MR images we must systematically score for global atrophy\\n, focal atrophy and for vascular disease (i.e. infarcts, white matter lesions, lacunes). This standardized assessment of the MR findings in a patient suspected of having a cognitive\\n disorder includes: Click on image to enlarge\\nGCA-scale for Global Cortical Atrophy:\\nGCA scale is the mean score for cortical atrophy throughout the complete cerebrum: The central sulcus is more posteriorly on more cranial images. Cortical atrophy is best scored on \\nFLAIR images. In some neurodegenerative disorders the atrophy is asymmetric and occurs in specific regions. A radiological report should mention any regional atrophy or asymmetry. W\\nhen assessing atrophy in different regions keep in mind that cranially, the central sulcus lies more posteriorly than you would expect (figure).\\nMTA-scale for Medial Temporal lobe Atrophy:\\nThe MTA-score should be rated on coronal T1-weighted images at a consistent slice position. Select a slice through the corpus of the hippocampus, at the level of the anterior pons. \\n75 years : MTA-score 3 or more is abnormal (i.e. 2 can still be normal at this age) Data from a study with 222 controls and patients with various forms of dementia in which this vis\\nual rating scale was used to assess temporal lobe atrophy suggest that sensitivities and specificities of 85% can be obtained for patients with AD. The score is based on a visual ra\\nting of the width of the choroid fissure, the width of the temporal horn, and the height of the hippocampal formation. < 75 years: score 2 or more is abnormal. 75 years: score 3 or \\nmore is abnormal. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images Here you can scroll through the images for examples of MTA score 0-4. < 75 years: score 2 or more is abnormal. 75 years: score 3 or more is \\nabnormal. Medial temporal lobe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and in controls. A high MTA-score is very sensitive for the diagnos\\nis of Alzheimer disease and is present in the vast majority of patients with AD, while in controls a positive score is almost always absent (table on the left). Therefore it is a go\\nod test to discern controls from patients with AD. This test is not completely specific for AD however, as MTA can also be found in other forms of dementias (7). On the other hand i\\nf a patient with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) a possible 'prodromal state of AD' has a negative MTA-score, it is very unlikely that this patient will develop AD (high sensitivity\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 282}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\" yields high negative predictive value), except in very young subjects, in whom a more posterior pattern of atrophy can be observed in AD. Coronal T1WI of the hippocampus demonstrat\\ning progressive atrophy in familial AD (images kindly provided by Nick Fox). If there is a strong suspicion of Alzheimer's disease, it can be useful to repeat the examination to see\\n if there is any progress of the (medial temporal lobe) atrophy. The images show a follow-up examination at 18 and 36 months in a patient who was at risk for familial AD, demonstrat\\ning progression of the disease. An alternative approach would be to perform a SPECT- or PET-scan to look for changes in perfusion/metabolism of the temporo-parietal cortex, as these\\n changes precede the development of atrophy.\\nFazekas scale for WM lesions:\\nOn MR, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunes - both of which are frequently observed in the elderly - are generally viewed as evidence of small vessel disease. The Fazekas\\n-scale provides an overall impression of the presence of WMH in the entire brain. It is best scored on transverse FLAIR or T2-weighted images. Score: The Fazekas scale for WM lesion\\ns predicts future disability in elderly. Fazekas 1 is considered normal in the elderly. Fazekas 2 and 3 are pathologic, but may be seen in normally functioning individuals. They are\\n however, at high risk for disability. In 600 normally functioning elderly people the Fazekas score predicted disability within one year (table).\\nIn the Fazekas 3 group 25% was disabled within one year (10). Three year follow-up shows that severe white matter changes independently and strongly predict rapid global functional \\ndecline (17). Caps and bands\\nNormal ageing:\\nThe findings in a normally aging brain can overlap with findings in dementia. As implicated earlier, there may be some degree of atrophy, though mainly of the white matter with incr\\neasing prominence of the perivascular (Virchow-Robin) spaces and non-specific fronto-parietal sulcal widening. There may also be some degree of medial temporal lobe atrophy. A MTA-s\\ncore of 2 for individuals older than 75 years of age may be normal. As the brain ages, there is an increasing deposition of iron in specific areas of the brain: mainly the basal gan\\nglia, nucleus ruber and pars reticluaris of the substantia nigra. There also may develop a rim of high signal intensity on T2W and FLAIR images around the ventricles, known as caps \\nand bands (figure). A limited amount of white matter hyperintensities may also occur in the normally ageing brain (Fazekas grade 1). Lacunes are always pathological.\\nStrategic infarctions:\\nStrategic infarctions are infarctions in areas that are crucial for normal cognitive functioning of the brain. These areas are summarized in the table. Strategic infarctions are bes\\nt seen on transverse FAIR and T2W sequences. The images show bilateral thalamic infarctions - lesions often associated with cognitive dysfunction. Transverse FLAIR images in two dif\\nferent patients. Study the images of two different patients. Then continue reading. The image on the far left shows an infarct in the vascular territory of the Posterior Cerebral Ar\\ntery (PCA), with involvement of the inferior medial temporal lobe which includes the hippocampus. This is a strategic infarction, since it is in the dominant hemisphere, it will res\\nult in cognitive dysfunction. The image next to it is a transverse FLAIR image showing another infarct in the PCA-territory, with involvement of the temporo-occipital association ar\\nea. This is another example of a strategic infarction that can result in cognitive dysfunction.\\nKoedam score for Parietal Atrophy:\\nIn addition to medial temporal lobe atrophy, parietal atrophy also has a positive predictive value in the diagnosis of AD. Atrophy of the precuneus is particularly characteristic of\\n AD (15). This is particularly the case in young patients with AD (presenile AD), who may have normal MTA-scores. The Koedam scale rates parietal atrophy - assessed in sagittal, cor\\nonal and axial planes. In these planes, widening of the posterior cingulate and parieto-occipital sulci as well as parietal atrophy (including the precuneus) is rated (Table). Koeda\\nm scale grade 0-1 Koedam scale grade 0-1 Sagittal T1-, axial FLAIR- and coronal T1-weighted images illustrating the Koedam scale of posterior atrophy. When different scores are obta\\nined in different orientations, the highest score must be considered (16). Koedam scale grade 2-3 Koedam scale grade 2-3 Sagittal T1-, axial FLAIR- and coronal T1-weighted images il\\nlustrating the Koedam scale of posterior atrophy. The yellow arrows point to extreme widening of the posterior cingulate en parieto-occipital sulci in a patient with grade 3 posteri\\nor atrophy.\\nFDG-PET:\\nIn addition to clinical findings, CSF and MRI, PET-imaging is useful in diagnosing AD. In AD FDG-PET can show hypometabolism in the temporoparietal regions and/or the posterior cing\\nulum. This may help differentiate AD from FTD, which shows frontal hypometabolism on FDG-PET. The images show FDG-PET and axial FLAIR images of a normal subject and of patients with\\n AD and FTD. FDG-PET (top row) and axial FLAIR images of a normal subject and of AD and FTD patients. In AD there is a decreased metabolism of the parietal lobes (yellow arrows), wh\\nereas in FTD, there is frontal hypometablism (red arrows).\\nSpecific Diseases:\\nThe prevalence of specific forms of dementia is age-dependent. In patients\\nIn patients > 65 years there are more cases of senile AD and vascular dementia. In many older patients with manifest AD there is co-existing vascular disease, which contributes to t\\nhe demented state. Specimen in end stage AD demonstrating severe global atrophy. Courtesy Webpath (11).\\nAlzheimers Disease:\\nAD accounts for 50%-70% of all cases of dementia in the elderly population. Age is a strong risk factor, with the disease affecting approximately 8% of individuals over the age of 6\\n5 and 30% over the age of 85 years. The progression of AD is gradual and the average patient lives 10 years after the onset of symptoms. With the increasing percentage of elderly in\\n the population, the prevalence of AD is expected to triple over the next 50 years. In end-stage AD there is widespread atrophy, which is no different from other end-stage dementias\\n. In imaging we therefore have to try to identify AD in an earlier stage and we have to concentrate on the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobe, because that is where AD starts.\\n The role of MRI in the diagnostic process of AD is twofold: Study the image, then continue reading. The findings are consistent with the diagnosis of end stage AD, because there is\\n: It is not specific for AD however, since severe GCA occurs in other end-stage disorders as well Presenile AD with normal hippocampus and severe parietal atrophy.\\nPresenile AD:\\nPresenile AD (\\nAlthough there usually is some mild hippocampal atrophy, the most striking finding is parietal atrophy with atrophy of the posterior cingulum and the precuneus; the hippocampus can \\nbe normal.\\nMild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):\\nMild cognitive impairment is a relatively recent term used to describe people who have some problems with their memory, but do not actually have dementia, since dementia is defined \\nas having problems in two or more cognitive domains. Some of these patients will be in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease or another dementia, so it is important to identify th\\nem. Finding MTA is a strong risk-factor for progression to dementia. PCA infarction involving the medial temporal lobe.\\nVascular Dementia (VaD):\\nVascular dementia (VaD) is thought to be the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. It can sometimes be distinguished from AD by a more sudden onset and ass\\nociation with vascular risk factors. VaD can be characterized by its stepwise deterioration with periods of stability followed by sudden decline in cognitive function. Most patients\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 283}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\", however, have small vessel disease, which is typified by a more gradual and subtle pattern of deterioration. Control of vascular risk factors is the treatment of choice, but choli\\nnesterase inhibitors (drugs that are being used in AD) are also increasingly being used to treat vascular dementia. The images show a patient with a strategic PCA infarction involvi\\nng the hippocampus. This type of infarct can result in sudden dementia if located in the dominant hemisphere. It will usually not result in dementia if it occurs in the non-dominant\\n hemisphere. Vascular dementia, no medial temporal lobe atrophy. In most patients with VaD there is diffuse white matter disease with large confluent lesions (Fazekas 3). In some of\\n these patients the ventricles may be dilated due to global atrophy and some will also have medial temporal lobe atrophy. The images are of a patient who had VaD, but the medial tem\\nporal lobe was normal.\\nStrategic infarcts and small vessel disease:\\nCognitive dysfunction in VaD can be the result of (2): MTA in a patient with VaD There is an increasing awareness for the importance of small vessel disease as a predictor of cognit\\nive decline and dementia. Moreover, it seems to amplify the effects of pathologic changes of Alzheimer's disease. On the left we see a patient who was diagnosed as having VaD. White\\n matter disease is seen as severe WMH (hypointense on T1) in the periventricular regions. In addition to these vascular changes, there is also MTA. Presumably this patient has both \\nVaD and AD, a finding seen in many elderly patients. These findings should be described separately as it may have therapeutic consequences. The problem however is, that white matter\\n hyperintensities and lacunes are also frequently observed in non-demented elderly and at some level can be regarded as normal findings in aging. To overcome this problem the NINDS-\\nAIREN International Work Group has formulated criteria for the history and physical, radiological, (see above) and pathological examination to classify patients as having possible, \\nprobable and definite VaD. However considerable interobserver variability exists for the assessment of the radiological part of these NINDS-AIREN criteria and some level of training\\n is mandatory (2). Bilateral medial strategic thalamus infarctions The medial nuclei of the thalamus play an important role in memory and learning. A large unilateral infarction or \\nbilateral infarctions in this region can cause dementia. You have to pay special attention to these areas to find these small infarctions. FLAIR misses thalamus infarctions On FLAIR\\n images you will easily miss these infarctions, because they can be isointense to the surrounding structures (8). A high resolution T2WI is needed to detect these thalamic infarcts.\\n FLAIR in the infratentorial region and in the spinal cord is of limited value as it suppresses not only the signal of water, but also pathology with a long T1-relaxation time. This\\n phenomenon can also be seen in the detection of Multiple Sclerosis, where FLAIR is of limited value in the infratentorial region and of no use in the spinal cord. Cerebral Amyloid \\nAngiopathy\\nCerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA):\\nDementia may be the clinical presentation in CAA, a condition in which ?-amyloid is deposited in the vessel walls of the brain. The result is hemorrhage, usually microhemorrhages, b\\nut also subarachnoid hemorrhage or lobar hematomas may occur.

No artophy of parietal and occipital lobes. Courtesy Webpath (11).\\nFrontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD ):\\nFTLD, formerly called Pick's disease, is a progressive dementia, that accounts for 5-10% of cases of dementia., and occurs relatively more frequently in presenile subjects FTLD is c\\nlinically characterized by behavioral and language disturbances that may precede or overshadow memory deficits. There is currently no treatment for this condition. Imaging plays an \\nimportant role in the diagnosis as the findings are easy to recognize. Radiological findings are pronounced atrophy of frontal and / or temporal lobes. In some forms of FTLD the atr\\nophy might be strikingly asymmetric, e.g. in Semantic Dementia, a disease subtype with progressive aphasia and left-sided temporal lobe degeneration. FTLD: T2WI and FLAIR with 'knif\\ne blade' atrophy of left temporal lobe with normal right temporal lobe The images are of a patient with progressive aphasia. The most prominent finding is the striking asymmetric at\\nrophy of the temporal lobe on the left side with not only atrophy of the hippocampus, but also the temporal poles. The atrophy has resulted in gyri that appear as sharp as knives ('\\nknife blade atrophy'). There is also some increased signal intensity seen on the FLAIR image, probably due to gliosis. These findings are pathognomonic for the diagnosis of FTLD. Pa\\ntients with left-sided temporal atrophy are usually clinically obvious. Right-sided atrophy is usually not as easily recognized as these patients only present with subtle disturbanc\\nes in recognizing faces. Lewy body dementia: normal hippocampus\\nDementia with Lewy bodies:\\nDementia with Lewy bodies is responsible for approximately 25% of dementias and belongs to the atypical Parkinson syndromes together with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and mu\\nlti-system atrophy (MSA). The clinical manifestations can be similar to that of AD or dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. Patients typically present with one of three symp\\ntom complexes: detailed visual hallucinations, Parkinson-like symptoms and fluctuations in alertness and attention. Pathologically, the disease is characterized by the presence of L\\newy bodies in various regions of the hippocampal complex, subcortical nuclei and neocortex with a variable number of diffuse amyloid plaques. Cholinesterase inhibitors are currently\\n the treatment of choice for this condition. The role of imaging is limited in Lewy body dementia. Usually the MR of the brain is normal, including the hippocampus. This finding is \\nimportant as it enables us to differentiate this disease from Alzheimer';s disease, the main differential diagnosis. Nuclear imaging can be used to demonstrate an abnormal dopaminer\\ngic system (so-called DaTscan) PSP with midbrain atrophy\\nProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP):\\nPSP is also one of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. In PSP there is pronounced atrophy of the midbrain (mesencephalon), which accounts for the typical upward gaze paralysis. PSP\\n: 'humming bird sign' due to midbrain atrophy Normally the upper border of the midbrain is convex. The atrophy of the midbrain in PSP results in a concave upper border of the midbra\\nin with the typical 'humming bird sign' (figure). 'Hot cross bun sign' in MSA\\nMulti System Atrophy (MSA):\\nMSA is also one of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. MSA is a rare neurological disorder characterized by a combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar and pyramidal signs, and auton\\nomic dysfunction. MSA can be classified as MSA-C, MSA-P or MSA-A. In MSA-C (formerly known as sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy or sOPCA) the cerebellar symptoms predominate, wh\\nereas in MSA-P the parkinsonian symptoms dominate (MSA-P was formerly known as striatonigral degeneration). MSA-A is the form in which autonomic dysfunction predominates and is the \\nnew term for what was formerly known as Shy-Drager syndrome. In MSA there is pronounced cerebellar atrophy and severe atrophy of the pons. In MSA-P: low T2 SI dorsolateral putamen a\\nnd slit-like increased SI lateral to putamen on T2. In contrast to PSP, we don't see the humming bird sign, because the midbrain has a normal convex upper border. The so-called 'hot\\n cross bun sign', which is a result of pontine hyperintensity, is typical for MSA-C. Notice the extreme atrophy of the pons and the cerebellum in this patient when we compare images\\n of 2015 with images of 2018. Changes in the neocortex as seen on FLAIR (left) and DWI (right)\\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD):\\nCJD is a very rare and incurable neurodegenerative disease, caused by a unique type of infectious agent called a prion.

Corticobasal degeneration\\nCorticobasal Degeneration (CBD):\\nCBD is a rare entity which may present with cognitive dysfunction, usually in combination with Parkinson-like symptoms. The so-called 'Alien-hand' syndrome is a typical manifestatio\\nn. MRI shows asymmetric parietal cortical atrophy, sometimes with associated hyperintensity of the white matter on T2W images. Axial FLAIR image shows striking asymmetric cortical p\\narietal atrophy in a patient with CBD.\\nHuntington Disease:\\nHuntington disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease (autosomal dominant trait, but often de novo mutations), and can present with early onset dementia as well as choreoathe\\ntosis and psychosis. Imaging shows characteristic atrophy of the caudate nucleus and subsequent enlargement of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.\\nCerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencehalopathy (CADASIL):\\nCADASIL is another hereditary disease which may present with a progressive cognitive dysfunction. Other presenting symptoms include migraines, stroke-like episodes and behavioral di\\nsturbances. It affects the small vessels of the brain. Confluent white matter hyperintesities in the frontal and especially anterior temporal lobes in combination with (lacunar) inf\\narcts and microbleeds are seen on imaging. The FLAIR images show classic findings in CADASIL - confluent white matter hyperintensities with lacunar infarcts and involvement of the a\\nnterior temporal lobes. Traumatic brain injury\\nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI):\\nLong term sequelae of traumatic brain injury such as cerebral contusions and diffuse axonal injury (DAI) may include cognitive impairment. Frontobasal/temporal parenchymal loss or T\\n2* black dots typical for DAI in a patient with a history of trauma must therefore be taken into consideration when assessing MR images for dementia. The FLAIR images show classic p\\nost-traumatic tissue loss with gliosis in both frontal lobes, the left occipital lobe and right temporal lobe. In the book on the left you can find more information about the role o\\nf MR in dementia (9). Neuroimaging in Dementia\\nMR protocol:\\nProtocol that is used in the Alzheimer Centre in Amsterdam Coronal-oblique T1-weighted images  are used for the assessment of medial temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy. They are \\nobtained in a plane orthogonal to the long axis of the hippocampus; this plane is orientated parallel to the brainstem. These should be thin-section images and are ideally obtained \\nby reformatting a sagittal 3D T1 sequence through the entire brain. Additional sagittal reconstructions will enable the assessment of midline structures as well as parietal atrophy,\\n which may be involved in certain neurodegenerative disorders. FLAIR images are used to assess global cortical atrophy (GCA), vascular white matter hyperintensities and infarctions.\\n T2-weighted images are used to assess infarctions, in particular lacunar infarctions in the thalamus and basal ganglia, which can be missed on FLAIR images. T2*-weighted images are\\n necessary to detect microbleeds in amyloid angiopathy. These images can also depict calcifications and iron deposition. DWI should be considered as a supplemental sequence in young\\n patients or in rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorders (DD - vasculitis, CJD). CT with negative scan angle for optimal vizualisation of the hippocampus in the transverse pl\\nane\\nCT protocol:\\nCT can be useful when contraindications prevent MRI or when the only reason for imaging is to rule out surgically treatable causes of cognitive decline. In the transverse plane the \\nscan angle should be parallel to the long axis of the temporal lobe. Use of multi-detector CT will enable coronally reformatted images to be reconstructed perpendicular to the long \\naxis of the temporal lobe for optimal vizualisation of the hippocampus.

The Weber classification focu\\nses on the integrity of the fibula and the syndesmosis, which holds the ankle mortise together. The Lauge-Hansen system focuses on the trauma mechanism. Adding the stages of Lauge-H\\nansen to the Weber system will help you to predict ligamentous injury and instability. This article will help you to correctly stage ankle injuries and to detect fractures, that are\\n not obvious at first sight.\\nShort overview:\\nBasically there are three main types of ankle fractures. Weber classified them as: These fractures are identical to the fractures described by Lauge-Hansen as supination-adduction, \\nsupination-exorotation and pronation-exorotation. We will first give a short overview of these fractures and then discuss them in more detail. Once you understand the trauma mechani\\nsm as described by Lauge-Hansen and the sequence of events that take place in stages, then you know where to look for fractures and ligamentous injuries.

According to Lauge-Hansen, it is the result of an adduction force on the supinated foot. Scroll through the images.

Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nWeber C:\\nThis is a fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. Usually there is a total rupture of the syndesmosis with instability of the ankle. According to Lauge-Hansen, it is the result\\n of an exorotation force on the pronated foot. Scroll through the images\\nExorotation injury:\\nWeber A fractures are usually not a problem. Weber B and C are more difficult and it is essential to understand the sequence of events in these injuries, which are both exorotation \\ninjuries. This implies that 75-80% of ankle injuries are exorotation injuries. Weber B starts anterolaterally and the sequence is: Weber C starts medially and the sequence is:\\nLigamentous rupture or Avulsion:\\nAnother important thing to remember is, that a ligament can rupture or cause an avulsion fracture at the insertion. Every ligamentous rupture has it's avulsion fracture counterpart.\\nWeber and Lauge-Hansen summary:\\nInstability is seen in:\\nWeber and Lauge-Hansen combined:\\nHow does it work when we combine the Weber classification to the stages of Lauge-Hansen? In daily practice most use the Weber system, which is easy to memorize, while the Lauge-Hans\\nen seems rather difficult at first glance. Combining the simplicity of Weber with the explanation of the trauma mechanism given by Lauge-Hansen has the advantage that you still use \\na simple system, but now you really know what is going on. For instance if you see a fracture that is a stage 2 in the Lauge-Hansen system, then you know that there also is a stage \\n1 injury and you will study the radiographs with a high suspicion for signs of stage 3 and 4. This can best be demonstrated by giving an example. Unstable ankle fracture The radiogr\\naphs show a fracture of the posterior malleolus. If you would just report this as - a fracture of the posterior malleolus - you would miss the point. This is probably an unstable an\\nkle fracture. A posterior malleolus fracture as an isolated finding is very uncommon. When we look at the scheme we will notice that a fracture of the posterior malleolus in most ca\\nses is part of a Weber B or a Weber C fracture. A tertius fracture is either Weber B stage 3\\nor - due to Weber C stage 4 (arrows). We have to re-examine the films to look for additional findings. Since we now know where to look, it will be easier to detect additional findin\\ngs. PE stage 1 On the ankle films there was no sign of an oblique fracture of the lateral malleolus, so we can exclude a Weber B fracture. There is still the possibility of a Weber \\nC fracture stage 4, i.e. medial rupture or avulsion, high fibular fracture and finally a posterior malleolus fracture. At reexamination you notice the subtle avulsion of the medial \\nmalleolus (red arrow), which is stage 1. Notice also the soft tissue swelling on the medial side (blue arrow) PE stage 3 Additional radiographs of the lower extremity were ordered a\\nnd they demonstrate a high fibular fracture, i.e. Weber C stage 3 also known as a Maisonneuve fracture. Weber C fracture stage 4. This is un unstable ankle injury that needs surgica\\nl repair. Understanding the fracture mechanism and the stages according to Lauge-Hansen helps you to make the right diagnosis This example is an every day case. The point that I wan\\nt to make is, that when you understand the sequence of injuries to the ankle, then you know where to look for fractures and soft tissue swelling indicating ligamentous injury.\\nWeber A in detail:\\nWe will now discuss the Weber classification and add the stages of the Lauge-Hansen system. Weber A is seen in 20-25% of all ankle fractures. The diagnosis as well as the treatment \\nis usually no problem. According to Lauge-Hansen the fracture results from an adduction force on the supinated foot. The lateral side is under extreme tension with stretch on the li\\ngaments which results in an avulsion fracture. Almost always the avulsion is seen as a horizontal fracture. This is called a pull off  type of fracture in contrast to a push off typ\\ne, which is seen as an oblique or vertical fracture. Weber-A stage I\\nStage 1:\\nWeber C is seen in approximately 20% of ankle fractures. It is the most difficult fracture to diagnose and the Lauge-Hansen system will help you to understand the fracture-mechanism\\n, as this will be an enormous help. According to Lauge-Hansen the fracture results from an exorotation force on the pronated foot. Stage 1 The first injury will occur on the medial \\nside, which is under maximum tension due to the pronation. It will lead to rupture of the medial collateral ligament or avulsion of the medial malleolus. Now the injury can stop and\\n there will only be a rupture of the medial collateral ligaments or avulsion of the medial malleolus. Lauge Hansen calls this PE stage 1. We can not cathegorize this in the Weber cl\\nassification, since there is no fibular fracture. In many cases the injury progresses to a higher stage.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 286}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Stage 2:\\nStage 2 is uncommon and easy to detect. More adduction force results in the medial malleolus being pushed off in a vertical or oblique way. Stage 2 is unstable because the ring of t\\nhe ankle is broken in two places. Notice the horizontal orientation of the lateral malleolus fracture and the vertical orientation of the fracture of the medial malleolus. Enormous \\nforces must have pushed off the medial malleolus. More on the ring of the ankle and instability\\nWeber B in detail:\\nStage 1: Rupture of anterior tibiofibular ligament - or avulsion fracture (Tilleaux)\\nStage 1-2:\\nWeber B is the most common type of ankle fracture and occurs in about 60 %. According to Lauge-Hansen the fracture results from an exorotation force on the supinated foot. Stage 1 i\\ns usually not visible on x-rays. What we normally see is a stage 2 oblique fracture through the syndesmosis and we have to assume that there is also a rupture of the anterior tibiof\\nibular ligament, which is stage 1. According to Lauge Hansen the first injury is on the lateral side, which is under maximum tension. In stage 2 the talus exorotates further and sin\\nce the foot is in supination, the lateral malleolus is held tightly in place by the lateral collateral ligaments. The lateral malleolus cannot move away without breaking. As a resul\\nt more rotation of the talus will fracture the fibula in an oblique or spiral fashion because the lateral malleolus is pushed off from anteromedially to posterolaterally. The images\\n show a Weber B fracture. The oblique course of the fracture is typical for Weber B and results from the exorotation of the talus that pushes against the fixed lateral malleolus. Th\\ne malleolar fracture usually starts medially at the level of the talar dome, but can also start a few centimeters above this level. Weber B - stage 3 and 4\\nStage 3-4:\\nStage 3 More posterior displacement of the lateral malleolus fragment by the talus results in tension on the posterior syndesmosis with rupture or avulsion of the posterior malleolu\\ns. Stage 4 Further posterior movement of the talus will result in extreme tension on the medial side and the deltoid ligament will either rupture or pull off the medial malleolus in\\n the transverse plane. The sequences in a Weber B fracture or Lauge-Hansen supination exorotation injury take place in a clockwise manner: Immediately after the injury the injured p\\narts may again align, which can make it difficult to detect the injuries. Weber B fracture The radiographs show a typical Weber B fracture. First study the images and then continue \\nreading. Do you see what stage this is? This is a Weber B stage 4 injury. Notice that all 4 stages are visible: These images show another typical Weber B fracture stage 4. There is \\nan oblique fracture of the fibula. There is an avulsion of the posterior malleolus and an avulsion of the medial malleolus. Here another typical Weber B fracture stage 4. First noti\\nce the oblique fibular fracture, which is best seen on the lateral view. This is stage 2 and we have to assume, that the anterior syndesmosis is ruptured. On the lateral view a smal\\nl tertius fragment is seen indicating stage 3. Now you start looking for stage 4 and you will notice the subtle lucency in the medial malleolus on the AP view (green arrow). Knowing\\n the stages of Lauge Hansen this must be a fracture. Here a more subtle case. At first impression there is a Weber B fracture stage 2. Now we start looking for stage 3, which is a t\\nertius fracture. The small linear density on the AP-view is enough to diagnose a tertius fracture. The soft tissue swelling on the medial side is probably a rupture of the medial co\\nllateral band , i.e. stage 4.\\nWeber C in detail:\\nStage 2-3:\\nThe talus rotates externally and moves laterally because it is free from its medial attachment. Due to the pronation, the lateral ligaments are not under tension and the fibula can \\nmove away from the tibia. This causes rupture of the anterior syndesmosis. This is stage 2. Continuous force will twist the fibula and displace it distally, while proximally it is f\\nixed to the tibia. Finally the interosseus membrane will rupture up to the point where the fibular shaft fractures. This is stage 3. This is always above the level of the syndesmosi\\ns. In many cases it is visible on the radiographs of the ankle, but in some cases the fracture is located high and will only be visible on a radiograph of the lower leg. This last t\\nype of fracture is also called Maisonneuve fracture. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Here we see the different stages in the axial plane. Scroll through the images. Weber C fracture - stage 3 The radiographs shows a Weber C fracture. There is an avuls\\nion fracture of the medial malleolus and a fibula fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. According to Lauge-Hansen this is stage 3 pronation exorotation injury and so the ante\\nrior syndesmosis (stage 2) must also be ruptured. We do not see a tertius fracture, which would indicate stage 4, but there may be a rupture of the posterior syndesmosis. Weber C fr\\nacture - at least stage 3 Here an example of a Weber C fracture with a proximal fibula fracture. Notice that on the radiograph of the ankle no fracture is seen. You might misdiagnos\\ne this as only some soft tissue swelling. In fact this is an unstable ankle fracture, since there also must be a rupture of the medial collateral ligament (stage 1) , so the ring is\\n broken in two places leading to instability. According to Lauge Hansen we are probably dealing with:\\nStage 4:\\nFinally the posterior syndesmotic ligament ruptures, or there is an avulsion of the posterior malleolus, also known as posterior malleolus fracture (red arrow). The medial clear spa\\nce is only slightly widened, but based on the stages of Lauge Hansen there must be a collateral band rupture.\\nInterpretation and Reporting:\\nAll the profits of the Radiology Assistant go to Medical Action Myanmar which is run by Dr. Nini Tun and Dr. Frank Smithuis sr, who is a professor at Oxford university and happens t\\no be the brother of Robin Smithuis.

Atherosclerosis  is usually\\nbilateral and frequently calcifications\\ncan be seen. Subtotal stenosisIn a high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis\\nthe flow through the internal carotid is  severely decreased and results in a collapse\\nand consequently a small caliber of the vessel\\ndistal to the occlusion. OcclusionIn a total occlusion the contrast has a { or curly bracket-like configuration. DissectionIn the case of a ICA dissection the bulbus is not involved\\n and the\\ncontrast in the proximal ICA has a flame-shaped  configuration. The total diameter of the ACI\\nis widened due to the formation of a mural hematoma. The narrowed eccentric true lumen is surrounded by a\\ncrescent-shaped mural on transversal imaging. The\\ncompressed true lumen can be occluded in case of severe compression. Pseudo-occlusionThis simulates an occlusion\\nof the lower cervical part of the internal carotid, but is actually the\\nresult of a stop at the carotid T-top. Contrast that tries to enter the\\ninternal carotid will give a waterpaint appearance due to this outflow\\nobstruction. Carotid webThis is  a thin shelf-like luminal protrusion of the\\nintimal fibrous tissue that extends from the posterior aspect of the proximal internal carotid artery bulb into the lumen.\\nThe carotid web is increasingly being associated with ischemic stroke in young\\nindividuals, especially females. Study showing that differentiation between carotid dissection and pseudo-occlusion is difficult There is a problem diagnosing carotid dissection ver\\nsus pseudo-obstruction. In a study in which the CTA-findings\\nwere compared to tDSA (golden standard for carotid lesions), the results showed\\nthat there was a high accuracy in diagnosing atherosclerotic occlusions and\\nhigh grade stenoses of the internal carotid artery. Only one atherosclerotic stenosis was\\nmisdiagnosed as a pseudo-occlusion. On the other hand pseudo-occlusions\\nwere misdiagnosed as carotid dissection and dissections were misdiagnosed as\\npseudo-occlusions quite frequently (red circles). In the chapters below we will discuss\\nhow to differentiate dissection from pseudo-occlusion. Tandem occlusions are intracranial occlusions\\ncombined with a severe (>70% ) stenosis or occlusion of the ICA.\\nThey are found\\nin up to 30% of all patients presenting with a large vessel occlusion. \\nThe accompanying\\nICA pathology is not a contra-indication for endovascular therapy for the\\nintracranial occlusion, regardless of the underlying  ethiology of the ICA stenosis/occlusion.

Sometimes a bias in the exact\\nevaluation of stenosis degree may be caused by the high attenuation values of\\nthe calcified plaques. \\nThis might lead to an overestimation of the degree of\\nstenosis. \\nFurthermore, heavily calcified plaques can be a challenge for the\\ninterventional neuroradiologist as the stenosis needs to passed with a large\\nbored guiding catheter or long sheath (at least 6 Fr).\\nNear occlusion:\\nIn a severe stenosis or near occlusion the diameter of the ACI above the level of the stenosis is diminished and less than the caliber of the contralateral ICA and the ipsilateral E\\nCA.

In the analyses conducted in randomized controlled\\ntrials such as the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial\\n(NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST), it was reported that\\nthe risk of stroke was low with medical treatment, and surgical therapy was not\\nbeneficial for internal carotid NO.However, an 11%–33% risk of ipsilateral\\nstroke within the first year has also been reported in medically treated\\npatients. Furthermore, other authors have\\nreported a significantly lower risk of future stroke after Carotid endarterectomy or Carotid artery stenting in these\\npatients. Seeking safe interventional\\nprocedures could, therefore, be worthwhile especially with the current improvements\\nin carotid stenting technique .\\nOcclusion:\\nIn a total atherosclerotic occlusion the contrast has a { or curly bracket-like configuration.\\nThe stop will be at the level of the bulbus.\\nCarotid Dissection:\\nA carotid dissection is the result of\\na tear in the intima of the vessel wall. As blood enters between the layers of\\nthe vessel wall an intramural hematoma is created. This intramural hematoma results in the following: Dissections cause about 2% of all ischemic strokes, but account for 10%−25% of \\nischemic strokes in young people.\\nPatients sometimes present with pain in the neck and may have a history of a previous trauma. On CTA a dissection presents with the\\nfollowing findings: Flame-shaped ICA These images show the typical flame-shaped presentation of a carotid dissection on sagittal CTA reconstructions and DSA. Notice that on the CTA \\nreconstruction you can follow the contours of the dilated ICA above the level where the contrast stops.\\nAlso notice how similar the images are, when you compare the CTA with the DSA. String sign In most cases a dissection will\\npresent with a flame-shaped appearance like in A, but when the lumen is less\\ncompressed and still partially patent you\\nmay get the \"string sign\" as in B. Look below the skull base When you consider the possibility of a dissection, t is important to study the axial images just below the skull base as\\n in this case. On the left side there is a normal ICA and ECA (the high density structure in between them is the styloid process).\\nOn the right side we see a normal ECA and medial to the jugular vein is the dilated ICA (circle).\\nThe lumen does not fill with contrast.\\nThe combination of an occlusion in an enlarged and dilated ICA means that we are dealing with a dissection. A dissection stops at the skull base This patient has a carotid\\ndissection. In A we see the compressed lumen in\\nan eccentric position (green arrow). The diameter of the ICA is enlarged\\nby the intramural hematoma (red arrowheads). When we follow the ICA cranially, the\\ndissection continues up to image E (arrowheads). At the level of the skull base, where\\nthe ICA enters the carotid canal (vertical petrous segment) , the dissection\\nstops and the ICA has a normal appearance (yellow arrow). Hyperdense thrombi A typical finding in dissection are\\nhyperdense thrombi as in these two patients. Whenever you see these kind of extremely\\nhyperdense thrombi, think of dissection and scroll down to just below the skull\\nbase.\\nThese thrombi are almost completely composed of erythrocytes.

The intima flap is still visible\\n. Again\\nyou can seen the intimal flap stopping at the level of the skull base.\\nPseudo-Occlusion:\\nPseudo-occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery refers to an isolated occlusion of the distal intracranial ICA that mimicks an extracranial ICA occlusion on CTA or DSA. In \\npseudo-occlusion it looks as if there is a total occlusion in the ICA just above the level of the bulbus.\\nThe contrast that enters the ICA has difficulty to move up further cranially, because of the stagnant blood within the ICA, since the ICA has no major side branches. \\nThe contrast will only slowly penetrate this stagnant blood column and this results in a waterpaint appearance. On CTA you will see a gradually\\ndiminishing contrast density in the ACI with a water paint appearance. The\\nproblem is the outflow obstruction at the level of the carotid T-top. A\\npseudo-occlusion is never seen in combination with a more distal occlusion. \\nFor\\nexample, in case of a M2 occlusion there will be sufficient outflow of the\\ndistal ICA through the other patent  M2\\ndivision and the ACA. Two cases of a carotid pseudo-occlusion. In the first case (left) the contrast\\nstop is rather abrupt, although a small zone of diminishing contrast density can\\nbe seen.\\nIn this case the differentiation between a pseudo-occlusion and a dissection or atherosclerotic occlusion\\ncan be difficult. \\nHowever, we do not see the typical flame shape\\nconfiguration of the bulbus as seen in a dissection and we see no signs of\\natherosclerosis (no plaque or calcifications). In the second case the gradually\\ndimishing contrast density is cleary seen over a longer course (arrowheads). \\nThis\\nis clearly a carotid pseudo-occlusion. Continue with the DSA images... Pseudo-occlusion with DSA The DSA gives us comparable images. In this patient during catheter\\nangiography, first there was a typical waterpaint appearance of the contrast\\nin the ICA, which simulated a proximal occlusion in the ICA. However the catheter could easily be  advanced  into\\nthe distal  ICA. After a more\\nforceful contrast injection there is a typical carotid-top occlusion on the\\nlateral view (just above the level of the ophthalmic artery.\\nThere is no contrast filling\\nof the intracerebral vessels.\\nFloating Thrombus:\\nOn the saggital view there is a longitudinal filling defect\\nin the proximal internal carotid artery (arrowheads). \\nThis filling defect is a\\nfloating thrombus attached to a atherosclerotic plaque located at the carotid\\nbulb (white arrow). In the axial plane this floatig thrombus causes a central\\nfilling defect in the ICA also now as a “donut sign” (arrowhead). In case of an\\naccompanying intracranial occlusion of a large vessel endovascular therapy is\\ninitiated to open this intracranial occlusion. \\nAn isolated floating thrombus\\n(no large vessel occlusion) is treated with heparine or\\nanti-platelet therapy .\\nCarotid Web:\\nA carotid web is a shelf-like lesion along the posterior wall of the internal carotid artery bulb and an under-recognized cause of stroke in young individuals. \\nSeveral studies suggest that patients with a carotid web have a high risk of recurrent stroke. In the MR CLEAN study 30 patients with a carotid web ipsilateral to the stroke were id\\nentified.\\nIn this study 1 out of every 6 patients with a symptomatic carotid web had a recurrent stroke within 2 years, suggesting that medical management alone may not provide sufficient pro\\ntection for patients with a carotid web. On the saggital view of the\\nCTA the shelf-like protusion on the dorsal wall of the ICA bulbus is seen. This\\nis the typical configuration location for a carotid web. However, for the\\ndefinite diagnosis of a carotid web a ridge connecting the lateral and medial\\nwall of the internal carotid artery must be seen in the axial view (arrow right\\nimage). Carotid webs can differ in size. \\nIn this case the\\ncarotid web is much smaller than in te previous example. \\nHowever, the imaging\\ncriteria for the diagnosis of a carotid web still apply. \\nOn the sagittal images\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 290}),\n",

On in the late arterial phase  view t stasis of contrast  is seen directly cranial of the web.  \\nIt is clear, that in this region, due to\\nturbulence and stasis thrombi can develop and can cause cerebral emboli.\\nIsolated Carotid:\\nAn isolated carotid means that the\\nICA supplies blood to the ipsilateral anterior and middle cerebral artery, but\\nthat there is no connection to the contralateral side or posterior circulation,\\nbecause the anterior (Acom) and posterior (Pcom) communicating artery are\\nmissing as an anatomic variant. This is one of the many variants of\\nthe circle of Willis. Patent circle of Willis Let us first describe the most common\\nsituation. In 90% of patients the circle of\\nWillis is patent. When these patients present with an\\nacute stroke as a result of a dissection, they usually have an embolus in the\\nmiddle cerebral artery. In those cases it is sufficient to\\ntreat the intracranial occlusion and the dissected carotid artery can be left\\nuntreated. The collateral circulation over the\\npatent circle of Willis will take over the blood flow to the middle cerebral\\nartery. Non-patent circle of Willis In 10% of cases the circle of Willis\\nis insufficient. In this case both the anterior and\\nposterior communicans artery are absent. If there is an occlusion of the ACI,\\nthen the patient is at risk for a massive stroke in both the anterior and\\nmiddle cerebral artery territory, since there is no collateral flow from the\\ncontralateral ICA. We will demonstrate this scenario in\\nthe following case... Case A 35-year-old woman presented at the ER with speech difficulties and a paresis of the right arm. The NECT did not show signs of a bleeding or infarction.\\nOn the CECT there was normal enhancement of the intracerebral vessels, which means no intracerebral occlusion. Within 20 minutes she was treated with IV trombolyse, which resulted i\\nn partial recovery. One hour later however there was a deterioration with hemiparalysis on the right and aphasia.\\nThe NIHSS was 27. Subsequently she was transported to the intervention center.\\nContinue with the CTA of the neck... The CTA of the neck shows the typical\\nflame shape of the proximal ICA indicating a dissection. Continue with the axial slices... The axial image shows a dilated left ICA with an eccentric compressed lumen. In conclusion\\n there is a 35-year old women with a massive stroke (NIHSS = 27), a carotid occlusion as a result of a dissection, but no intracranial occlusion. At that moment the questions were: \\nThe DSA of the left ICA confirmed the\\ndissection (arrowheads) by demonstrating the flame shaped configuration of the proximal\\nICA . Subsequently a DSA of the right ICA\\nand the left vertebral artery was performed. \\nThe angiography of the right ICA showed\\nan absent Acom as not contrast crossed from right to left. In addition,\\ncontrast injection in the left vertebral artery showed an absence of a Pcom. This was proof of the diagnosis\\n\"Isolated carotid artery\". Poor perfusion in the anterior and middle cerebral artery territory (all penumbra, no infarct core on CBV images (not shown) Now what is the explanation f\\nor the contrast\\nfilling  of the left middle cerebral\\nartery as the left ACI is occluded and there is no collateral flow through the\\ncircle of Willis? The explanation is, that there are\\nsmall collaterals between the external carotid artery (ECA) and the ICA. This is enough to to fill the ACM\\nwith contrast , but this is not sufficient for adequate perfusion of the left\\nhemisfere. \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 291}),\n",

Radiographics. 2014 Oct;34(6):1680-91.\\nHip pathology in Children:\\nImaging findings:\\nJoosje Bomer and Herma Holscher\\nJuliana Children's hospital, the Hague, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2015-08-11 In this review we will discuss the most common imaging findings in children with hip pain.\\nIntroduction:\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\nChildren with hip pathology may present with hip pain or a limp. The differential diagnosis can be narrowed down according to age (see Table). Young children in particular may have \\ndifficulty localizing or communicating the location of their pain; and sometimes children who initially seem to have a hip problem actually have underlying pathology of the knee or \\nfoot.\\nImaging:\\nIn children from 2 to 10 years old with symptoms less than 5 days, and in the absence of high fever or elevated inflammatory markers - a wait-and-see policy is recommended. In these\\n cases the diagnosis is usually transient synovitis, which is a spontaneously resolving condition. Sometimes the referring physician will request an ultrasound to confirm the presen\\nce of a joint effusion. In all other cases x-ray imaging should be performed. The diagram shows a practical approach to hip pain and a new limp. Click on the image to enlarge. It is\\n important to realize that early in the course of Perthes disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteomyelitis and septic arthritis, the initial radiographs may be normal. Because \\nyoung children may have difficulty communicating the problem, it may be necessary to image the entire extremity. In most cases osseous pathology can be excluded with a frog-leg late\\nral (or Lauenstein) view only. In case of suspected pathology on the frog-leg lateral view, an additional AP radiograph should also be acquired for orthopedic and follow-up purposes\\n. Children with cerebral palsy are at an increased risk for hip dislocation, and in these cases an AP-view is recommended. An AP-view is also recommended in other situations an adeq\\nuate frog-leg lateral view is not possible. Lead Shielding The reduction of gonadal radiation exposure with lead shielding is negligible. Gonadal shielding is dissuaded for the foll\\nowing reasons: Note: as this is a relatively new insight, some of the images in this article do still include lead shielding.\\nPathology:\\nTransient synovitis. The left hip shows a joint effusion (arrow) in the anterior recess which causes separation of the layers of the capsule which are now easily recognized\\nTransient synovitis:\\nTransient synovitis - also known as coxitis fugax - is an aseptic inflammation of the hip, presumably of postviral etiology. Affected children are only mildly ill or have recently s\\nustained a low grade respiratory tract infection. The condition is self-limiting and treated with rest and analgesics. It is the most common cause of hip pain or a limp in children \\nunder the age of ten years. Imaging is not strictly necessary, but an ultrasound is often requested to confirm the presence of a joint effusion. Radiography is only performed when t\\nhere are other differential diagnostic considerations. Do not suggest the presence of an effusion on radiographs, as widening of the joint space is a non-specific finding. Always co\\nnsider the possibility of septic arthritis in a sick child! The appearance of the effusion on ultrasound is not helpful for the differential diagnosis.\\nPerthes disease:\\nPerthes disease, also known as Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, is an idiopathic avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis. It occurs more commonly in boys, typically between \\n5 and 8 years of age, but may range from the ages 3-12. It can occur bilaterally, but it is usually asymmetric. Early radiographs may be normal or show subtle flattening of the femo\\nral head. Sclerosis and subchondral fractures may develop, features best appreciated on the frog-leg lateral view. The images show Perthes disease of the right hip in a five-year ol\\nd boy. The findings are: Early on in the disease radiographs may be negative, but MRI will show edema in the femoral head with loss of high bone marrow signal on T1-weighted images.\\n Sometimes a radiographically occult fracture can be detected on MRI as a double rim sign on T2-weighted images with fatsat. Joint effusion may be present. Cartilage may become hype\\nrtrophic on the affected side. The images show right-sided Perthes disease in a nine-year old girl. There is loss of T1 high signal of the fatty marrow due to edema and sclerosis. T\\nreatment is symptomatic. Depending on whether or not there is spontaneous revascularization, the disease may or may not progress. In disease progression, fragmentation and collapse \\nof the femoral head will occur. Metaphyseal lucencies can be seen. In the healing phase, Perthes disease can lead to a short, broad femoral head and collum. This is also known as co\\nxa magna deformity. Surgical reconstruction (Salter osteotomy) may be required to prevent early osteoarthritis. The images show: The radiologic differential diagnosis of Perthes dis\\nease includes: Secondary avascular necrosis Perthes disease has to be differentiated from avascular necrosis with a known cause, as this may require a different treatment approach. \\nCauses of avascular necrosis include: The x-ray is of a 15-year old with acute lymphatic leukemia who was treated with steroids. The images alone cannot differentiate from Perthes d\\nisease, but based on the clinical information, this is secondary avascular necrosis. Meyer's dysplasia This is an uncommon condition in which the femoral heads show delayed ossifica\\ntion and fragmentation, most often occurring bilaterally. Radiographically it cannot be differentiated from Perthes disease. It does not show progressive collapse or deformity over \\ntime and is symmetric. It generally occurs in a younger population (2-4 years old). The condition itself is asymptomatic and the joints will develop normally. Multiple epiphyseal dy\\nsplasia Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia can mimick Perthes disease as it may manifest primarily in the hips. It is a rare hereditary skeletal dysplasia. Patients present with a waddli\\nng gait, pain, fatigue and short stature. Contrary to Perthes disease, the abnormalities are usually symmetric. The knees, ankles and wrists are usually also involved. Endochondral \\nossification is abnormal and results in small, fragmented epiphyses with alignment abnormalities. Radiographs of all joints are required to establish the diagnosis. Patients will de\\nvelop premature osteoarthritis. The treatment is symptomatic. Slipped epiphysis in a thirteen-year old boy. AP radiograph shows a slightly widened epiphysis, but this can easily be \\noverlooked. The frog-leg lateral view shows a medio-posterior slippage of the left femoral epiphysis.\\nSlipped Capital Femoral Eiphysis:\\nSlipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) or femoral epiphysiolysis is an idiopathic Salter-Harris type I fracture of the proximal femoral epiphysis. It occurs more commonly in boys \\nand in obese children. The typical age at presentation is between 12-15 years. SCFE may occur bilaterally in up to one third of cases. The epiphysis slips posteriorly, and to a less\\ner extent medially. It is therefore best appreciated on the frog-leg lateral view. SCFE is treated with surgical fixation to prevent further slippage.

              " Document(page_content=\"Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a clinical diagnosis and is currently divided into six different subtypes. In most cases, less than 4 joints are involved. Large joints are ma\\ninly affected, including the hips. JIA begins with a tenosynovitis and only later shows bone edema, periostitis, osteoporosis and growth disturbances. Contrary to the adult populati\\non, cartilage loss and erosions are not a frequent finding in JIA. X-rays are usually negative early on in the disease. Typical findings in later stages of the disease may be a slig\\nhtly larger epiphysis, or accelerated bone maturation. Since JIA is treated aggressively early on, radiographic bony changes may remain absent. Ultrasound will show effusion, thicke\\nned synovium and sometimes hyperemia. MRI will also demonstrate the joint effusion and synovial thickening, but can also show damage to the bone and cartilage. It is also a great mo\\ndality for the assessment of resulting growth disturbances.\\nOsteomyelitis:\\nOsteomyelitis is a relatively common severe condition in children, occurring most frequently in children under the age of five years. At this young age, the presentation can be rath\\ner non-specific, and infants may present only with a fever and failure to thrive. Most cases are hematogenous, and may be a sequela of a respiratory tract infection. Staphylococcus \\naureus is the most common pathogen. 5 week old, sick infant with severe osteomyelitis of the left hip. MRI with Gadolinium contrast shows extensive soft tissue involvement and perio\\nsteal reaction. Most radiographs will not show abnormalities in the early stages of the disease, but after 7-10 days there may be lytic changes and periosteal reactions. Ultrasound \\ncan be helpful in the diagnosis in cases with subperiosteal abscess formation. In suspected osteomyelitis, MRI is the imaging method of choice. In infants or young children in whom \\nthe location may be uncertain, bone scintigraphy can be useful. Both MRI and bone scintigraphy show abnormalities in the early stages of the disease. On MRI osteomyelitis appears as\\n an area of T2 increased signal in the metaphysis with enhancement and surrounding edema in the soft tissues, and occasionally a subperiosteal abscess. In infants and children with \\nclosed growth plates, the growth plate does not act as a barrier and infection may spread to the epiphysis and joint. . At four months follow-up a residual, but less prominent perio\\nsteal reaction is present and there is accelerated bone maturation. In osteomyelitis bone scintigraphy will show an area of increased uptake. Osteomyelitis is treated with i.v. anti\\nbiotics and has a good prognosis if detected promptly. Brodie's abscess A subtype of osteomyelitis which is typically seen in children is a Brodie's abscess. It is a subacute osteom\\nyelitis with intraosseous abscess formation. The only complaint can be pain. Fever and inflammatory markers may be absent. The abscess is usually located in the metaphysis of long b\\nones, but may be located in the epiphysis in young children. On x-ray there is a sharp defined oval lytic lesion with or without a sclerotic rim, with its long axis parallel to the \\nlong axis of the bone (see figure). On MRI the lesion is hyperintense on T2WI. There is joint effusion and only minimal edema in the surrounding musculature. Five-year old boy with \\na limp and fever at presentation. Ultrasound was difficult because the boy was unable to stretch his leg, but the left hip clearly shows an effusion and synovial thickening. Pus was\\n evacuated in the operating theater.\\nSeptic arthritis:\\nSeptic arthritis is a surgical emergency. The inflammation of a joint in septic arthritis is bacterial and, as in osteomyelitis, is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Septic a\\nrthritis can have a rapidly deteriorating course with destruction of the joint. Affected children are ill, with fever and severe joint pain. On ultrasound there is joint effusion (a\\ns previously mentioned, the echogenicity is not of diagnostic value). The synovium may be thickened, but this is a non-specific finding also found in other inflammatory pathology su\\nch as JIA. The clinical profile, laboratory findings and the presence of a joint effusion are suggestive of septic arthritis. Subsequent aspiration of pus confirms the diagnosis. Su\\nrgical debridement should take place as soon as possible. Radiographs are not sensitive to joint effusion and are not helpful in the early diagnosis. Nevertheless, they should be ac\\nquired for follow-up purposes. Joint space narrowing and osteolysis will become visible in later stages of the disease. MRI may be helpful to assess the extent of disease and can de\\ntect possible concomitant osteomyelitis. *NOTE: Absence of joint effusion excludes septic arthritis.*\\nAvulsion injuries:\\nAvulsion injuries of the pelvis are a frequent cause of hip pain in adolescents involved in sports. Because at this age the tendons are generally stronger than the apophyses, strong\\n muscle contraction can result in apophyseal avulsion fractures. Avulsion injuries can be acute or chronic. Typical avulsion injury of the anterior inferior iliac spine at the inser\\ntion of the rectus femoris tendon. Typical avulsion injury of the right ischial aphophysis. Osteoid osteoma\\nBone tumors and tumor-like lesions:\\nThere are many bone tumors and tumor-like lesions that may cause pain in the hip or upper leg. We will not discuss the various bone tumors here, but osteoid osteoma must be addresse\\nd, since it is a relatively common tumor, and the cortex of the femoral neck a common location. Osteoid osteoma is a benign tumor characterized by an extensive bony reaction and sev\\nere bone pain, occurring mainly at night. X-ray imaging shows a small oval lytic lesion which may be obscured by the dense, bony reaction surrounding it. MRI shows the nidus. Eosino\\nphilic granuloma Other bone tumors and tumor-like lesions such as eosinophilic granuloma may also be the underlying cause of a painful hip. Periosteal reaction of the fibula in a fi\\nbular Toddler's fracture.\\nKnee and foot:\\nAs mentioned previously, young children may have difficulty communicating the cause of their pain or limp. In such cases it is wise to analyze their gait and image the entire extrem\\nity. A toddler's fracture (image) may be one of the possible underlying causes. Corner fractures in a case of child abuse Corner- or bucket handle fractures should raise the suspici\\non of non-accidental injury (NAI)\\nSee section on child abuse.

The hemarthros will result in a displacement of the anterior fat pad upwards and the posterior fat backwards. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images.\\nExtreme valgus:\\nThe other important fracture mechanism is extreme valgus of the elbow. The normal elbow already has a valgus positioning. When a child falls on the outstrechted arm, this can lead t\\no extreme valgus. On the lateral side this can result in a dislocation or a fracture of the radius with or without involvement of the olecranon. When the forces have more effect on \\nthe humerus, the extreme valgus will result in a fracture of the lateral condyle. On the medial side the valgus force can lead to avulsion of the medial epicondyle. Sometimes the me\\ndial epicondyl becomes trapped within the joint. Because of the valgus position of the normal elbow an avulsion of the lateral epicondyle will be uncommon.\\nRadiological Interpretation:\\nMethodical review:\\nWhen looking at radiographs of the elbow after trauma a methodical review of the radiographs is needed . You should ask yourself the following important questions. Is there a sign o\\nf joint effusion? After trauma this almost always indicates the presence of hemarthros due to a fracture (either visible or occult). Is there a normal alignment between the bones? I\\nn children dislocations are frequent and can be very subtle. Are the ossification centres normal? Is the piece of bone that you're looking at a normal ossification centre and is thi\\ns ossification centre in the normal position. . Look especially for the position of the radial epiphysis and the medial epicondyle (figure). Is there a subtle fracture? Some of the \\nfractures in children are very subtle. \\nSo you need to be familiar with the typical picture of these fractures. . Normal anterior fat pad.\\nFat Pad Sign and Joint effusion:\\nNormally on a lateral view of the elbow flexed in 90? a fat pad is seen on the anterior aspect of the joint . This is normal fat located in the joint capsule. On the posterior side \\nno fat pad is seen since the posterior fat is located within the deep intercondylar fossa. Positive fat pad sign both anteriorly as well as posteriorly. Positive fat pad sign Disten\\ntion of the joint will cause the anterior fat pad to become elevated and the posterior fat pad to become visible. An elevated anterior lucency or a visible posterior lucency on a tr\\nue lateral radiograph of an elbow flexed at 90? is described as a positive fat pad sign (figure). Hemarthros results in an upward displacement of the anterior fat pad and a backward\\n displacement the posterior fat. Positive Anterior Fat Pad sign. On digital radiographs you may need to adjust the window width and level to appreciate this. No fracture was visible\\n on the X-rays. Positive fat pad sign (2)\\nAny elbow joint distention either hemorrhagic, inflammatory or traumatic gives rise to a positive fat pad sign. If a positive fat pad sign is not present in a child, significant int\\nra-articular injury is unlikely. A visible fat pad sign without the demonstration of a fracture should be regarded as an occult fracture. These patients are treated as having a nond\\nisplaced fracture with 2 weeks splinting. Skaggs et al repeated x-rays after three weeks in patients with a positive posterior fat pad sign but no visible fracture. They found evide\\nnce of fracture in 75%. They concluded that in trauma displacement of the posterior fat pad is virtually pathognomonic of the presence of a fracture. Displacement of the anterior fa\\nt pad alone however can occur due to minimal joint effusion and is less specific for fracture. Notice that the elbow is not positioned well. Try to find out what went wrong in the c\\nhapter on positioning.\\nAlignment:\\nThere are two important lines which help in the diagnosis of dislocation and fracture . These are the Radiocapitellar line and the Anterior humeral line. Radiocapitellar line\\nA line drawn through the centre of the radial neck should pass throught the centre of the capitellum, whatever the positioning of the patient, since the radius articulates with the \\ncapitellum (figure). In dislocation of the radius this line will not pass through the centre of the capitellum. On the left we see, that the radiocapitellar line goes through centre\\n of the capitellum on every radiogragh even though C and D are not well positioned. Notice supracondylar fracture in B. On the left more examples of the radiocapitellar line. The ri\\nght lower image shows an obvious dislocation of the radius. Radiographs of elbows at different ages. The Anterior Humeral line goes through the middle third of the capitellum . Ante\\nrior humeral line. A line drawn on a lateral view along the anterior surface of the humerus should pass through the middle third of the capitellum.. This line is called the Anterior\\n Humeral line . In cases of a supracondylar fracture the anterior humeral line usually passes through the anterior third\\nof the capitellum or in front of the capitellum due to posterior bending of the distal humeral fragment. On the left the anterior humeral line passes through the anterior third of t\\nhe capitellum. This indicates that the condyles are displaced dorsally (i.e. supracondylar fracture). First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The radiocapitellar \\nline ends above the capitellum. This means that the radius is dislocated. Did you also notice the olecranon fracture? Whenever the radius is fractured or dislocated, always study th\\ne ulna carefully. The order of appearance of the ossification centres is specified in the mnemonic C-R-I-T-O-E.\\nOssification centres:\\nThere are 6 ossification centres around the elbow joint.\\n They appear and fuse to the adjacent bones at different ages. It is important to know the sequence of appearance since the ossification centers always appear in a strict order. Thi\\ns order of appearance is specified in the mnemonic C-R-I-T-O-E\\n(Capitellum - Radius - Internal or medial epicondyle - Trochlea - Olecranon - External or lateral epicondyle). The ages at which these ossification centres appear are highly variabl\\ne and differ between individuals. It is not important to know these ages, but as a general guide you could remember 1-3-5-7-9-11 years. Fragmented appearance of the Trochlea in 2 di\\nfferent children. The Trochlea has two or more ossification centres which can give the trochlea a fragmented appearance. Trochlea ossification-fragments simulate loose bodies in the\\n joint On a lateral view the trochlea ossifications may project into the joint. They should not be mistaken for loose intra-articular bodies (arrow).\\nRadiography:\\nShoulder higher than elbow. Radius and Capitellum project on to the ulna.\\nCommon errors in positioning:\\nError 1: Shoulder higher than elbow For a true lateral view the shoulder should be at the level of the elbow. If the shoulder is higher than the elbow, the radius and capitellum wil\\nl project on the ulna. The solution is either to lift the examination table which will lift the elbow or to lower the shoulder by placing the patient on a smaller chair. LEFT: Sligh\\nt endorotation of the humerus due to a low position of the wrist. RIGHT: More endorotation due to malpositioning. Error 2: Wrist lower than elbow On the left two examples of a 'low \\nwrist positioning' leading to rotation of the humerus. The low position of the wrist leads to endorotation of the humerus. The lateral structures like the capitellum and the radius \\nwill move anteriorly, while a medial structure like the medial epicondyle will move posteriorly.

The hand should be with the 'thumb up'.\\nElbow fractures:\\nSupracondylar fractures:\\nThese fractures account for more than 60% of all elbow fractures in children (see Table). More than 95% of supracondylar fractures are hyperextension type due to a fall on the outst\\nretched hand. \\nThe elbow becomes locked in hyperextension. \\nThe olecranon is pushed into the olecranon fossa causing the anterior humeral cortex to bend and eventually break. \\nIf the force continues both the anterior and posterior cortex will fracture. Supracondylar fractures. In A the anterior humeral line passes through the anterior third of the capitel\\nlum and in B even more anteriorly. Notice positive posterior fat pad sign in both cases Supracondylar fractures (2)\\nIf there is only minimal or no displacement these fractures can be occult on radiographs. \\nThe only sign will be a positive fat pad sign. \\nUsually there is some displacement and the anterior humeral line will not pass through the centre of the capitellum but through the anterior third or even anterior to the capitellum\\n (figure). Supracondylar fractures (3)\\nSupracondylar fractures are classified according to Gartland.\\nGartland Type I fractures are often difficult to see on X-rays since there is only minimal displacement. \\nMost of these fractures consist of greenstick or torus fractures. The only clue to the diagnosis may be a positive fat pad sign. \\nThese patients are treated with casting. In Gartland type II fractures there is displacement but the posterior cortex is intact. \\nThere may be some rotation. These fractures require closed reduction and some need percutaneous fixation if a long-arm cast does not adequately hold the reduction. Gartland type III\\n fracture Gartland type III fractures are completely dislocated and are at risk for malunion and neurovascular complications (figure). They require reduction by closed or if necessa\\nry open means. Stabilisation is maintained with either two lateral pins or medial lateral cross pin technique. Gartland III fracture with medial-lateral cross pin technique. After r\\neduction there is inadequate correction of medial collaps. After two months there is malunion with cubitus varus deformity. Supracondylar fractures (4)\\nMalunion will result in the classic 'gunstock' deformity due to rotation or inadequate correction of medial collaps. Posterolateral displacement of the distal fragment can be associ\\nated with injurie to the neurovascular bundle which is displaced over the medial metaphyseal spike. Nerve injurie almost always results in neuropraxis that resolves in 3-4 months. V\\nascular injurie usually results in a pulseless but pink hand. \\nConservative management and vascular intervention have the same outcome. \\nA pulseless and white hand after reduction needs exploration. Flexion-type supracondylar fracture caused by direkt impact Supracondylar fractures (5) Flexion-type fractures are unco\\nmmon (5% of all supracondylar fractures). \\nThey are caused by direct impact on the flexed elbow.\\n Ulnar nerve injury is more common. \\nCompared to extension types, they are more likely to be unstable, so more likely to require fixation.\\nLateral Condyle fractures:\\nThis fracture is the second most common distal humerus fracture in children. They occur between the ages of 4 and 10 years. These fractures occur when a varus force is applied to th\\ne extended elbow. They tend to be unstable and become displaced because of the pull of the forearm extensors. Since these fractures are intra-articular they are prone to nonunion be\\ncause the fracture is bathed in synovial fluid. Lateral condyle fractures are classified according to Milch. They are Salter-Harris IV epiphysiolysis fractures. Most are Milch II fr\\nactures that travel from the lateral humeral metaphysis above the epiphysis and exit through the lateral crista of the trochlea leading to an unstable humeral ulnar articulation. La\\nteral Condyle fractures (2) The problem with the Milch-classification is the fact that the fracture fragments are primarily cartilaginous. The fracture line through the cartilage is\\n not visible on radiographs, so the radiographic interpretation concerning classification is difficult.\\nTreatment strategies are therefore based on the amount of displacement (see Table). Undisplaced fractures are treated with a long arm cast.\\nThese fractures must be carefully monitored as they have a tendency to displace. At follow up both AP and Oblique views are taken after removal of the cast. \\nOnce displaced fractures consolidate in a malunited position, treatment is difficult and fraught with complications.\\nFor this reason surgical reductions is recommended within the first 48 hours. Open reduction is indicated for all displaced fractures and those demonstrating joint instability. Late\\nral Condyle fractures (3) .\\nThe diagnosis of a lateral condyle fracture can be challenging. Fracture lines are sometimes barely visible (figure). Remembering the fact that the lateral condyle fracture is the s\\necond most common elbow-fracture in children and because you know where to look for will help you Lateral condyle fracture. On the x-ray only a small metaphyseal fragment is visible\\n. The detatched fragment however is larger than it appears on the radiograph. The fracture extents into the lateral ridge of the trochlea. Elbow is probably unstable. Lateral Condyl\\ne fractures (4) . Since most of the structures involved are cartilageneous, it is very difficult to know the exact extent of the fracture. CT reconstruction of displaced lateral con\\ndyle fracture. Humeroulnar joint is stable. Sometimes the fracture runs through the ossified part of the capitellum. In those cases it is easy. The case on the left shows a lateral \\ncondyle fracture extending through the ossified part of the capitellum. This is a Milch I fracture. The elbow is stable. \\nThere is too much displacement so osteosynthesis has to be performed. MR of lateral condyle fracture. Milch II and unstable elbow.

The case on the left shows a fracture extending into the unossified trochlear ridge. The fracture through the trochlear cart\\nilage is so far medial that the ulna is only supported on the medial side. This means that the elbowjoint is unstable.

Blue arrow indicates a cleft epiphysis of the radius (normal variant) Lateral Cond\\nyle fractures (5) \\nIn lateral condyle fractures the actual fracture line can be very subtle since the metaphyseal flake of bone may be minor.

Notice radial head dislocation and olecranon fracture\\nMedial Epicondyle avulsion:\\nThe medial epicondyle is an apophysis since it does not contribute to the longitudinal growth of the humerus. \\nIt is located on the dorsal side of the elbow. On a lateral view especially if the arm is endorotated it can project so far posteriorly that one could suggest an avulsion (figure). \\nHowever avulsions are located more distally and anteriorly. Since the medial epicondyle is an extra-articular structure a fracture or avulsion will not automatically produce a posit\\nive fat pad sign. Avulsion of medial epicondyle. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (2). 80% of avulsion fractures occur in boys with a peak age in early adolescence. The mechanism is an ac\\nute valgus stress due to a fall on the outstretched hand or sometimes due to armwrestling. Chronic injuries do occur in young athletes (little league elbow). The mechanism that caus\\nes these stressfractures on the medial side is the same mechanism that causes a osteochondritis of the capitellum due to impaction on the lateral side. Dislocation of the elbow with\\n interposed medial epicondyle. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (3). There is a 50% incidence of associated elbow dislocations. \\nWhen the elbow is dislocated and the medial epicondyle is avulsed,\\n it may become interposed between the articular surface of the humerus and the olecranon (figure). In every dislocation the first question should be 'where is the medial epicondyle'\\n. Same case as above. After reduction the epicondyle returned to its normal position (not good visible due to cast) and was fixated with K-wires. On reducing the elbow the fragment \\nmay return to it's original position or remain trapped in the joint. \\nThis may severely damage the articular surface. So post-reduction films should be studied carefully. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (4). Due to the extreme valgus force the joint may te\\nmporarily open. \\nThe avulsed fragment may become entrapped in the joint even when there is no dislocation of the elbow. On AP-view the avulsed medial epicondyle projects over the trochlea. Lateral v\\niew shows the fragment to be trapped within the joint. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (5).\\nAn avulsed fragment that is located within the joint can give diagnostic problems. On an AP-view this fragment may be overlooked (figure). When the trochlea is not yet ossified the \\navulsed fragment may simulate a trochlear ossification centre. Another example of a dislocated elbow with avulsion of the medial epicondyle. In this case the epicondyle is not retra\\ncted into the joint. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (6). Treatment Non-displaced fractures are treated with 1-2 weeks cast or splint. \\nThere is disagreement about the amount of displacement of the medial epicondyle that requires operative fixation. There is support for both operative aswell as non-operative managem\\nent of medial epicondyle fractures with 5-15mm displacement. Avulsion of the medial epicondyle. The amount of soft tissue swelling on the medial side suggests that the elbow was dis\\nlocated. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (7). If the history or the radiographs suggest that the elbow was or is dislocated, greater soft tissue injurie is likely to be present requiring\\n need for early motion.

Subtle radial neck fracture seen only on AP-view.\\nProximal fractures of the Radius:\\nIn adults fractures usually involve the articular surface of the radial head.\\n In children however it's the radial neck that fractures because the metaphyseal bone is weak due to constant remodelling. \\nUsually it is a Salter Harris II fracture. If there is no displacement it can be difficult to make the diagnosis (figure). Radial neck fracture with tilt. Notice trochlear ossificat\\nions projecting in between humerus and ulna simulating intra-articular fragments. If there is less than 30? tilt of the radial head patients are treated with a collar. \\nIt is important to realize that there is normally some angulation of the radial head ( up to 15?). If there is more than 30? tilt closed reduction is performed. After closed reducti\\non radiograph in cast shows unsuccesfull reduction. K-wire insertion is performed Whenever closed reduction is unsuccesfull in restoring tilt or when it is not possible to pronate a\\nnd supinate up to 60?, a K-wire is inserted to maintain reduction. The radial epiphysis is slipped (arrows). The radiocapitellar line does not pass through the capitellum indicating\\n dislocation and there is a fracture of the olecranon Radial neck fractures aswell as radial head dislocations are in 50% of the cases associated with other elbow injuries. \\nThe most common is a fracture of the olecranon. When the radial epiphysis is yet very small a slipped radial epiphysis may be overlooked (figure). Same patient as above 4 weeks late\\nr If these fractures are not recognized or reduction is unsuccesfull radial head overgrowth can be the result. A short radius may also be the result since the epiphysis of the radiu\\ns contributes to the length growth of the radius. LEFT: an obvious radial dislocation.

Radius Pulled Elbow (Nursemaid's elbow) In children When the forearm is pulled the radial head moves dista\\nlly and the ligament slips over the radial head and becomes trapped within the joint.

During the pre-ovulatory phase the dominant follicle\\ncan be identified by its “ring-of-fire” (right image).\\nLuteal body:\\nAfter the ovulation the dominant follicle becomes smaller\\n(left) and in the absence of pregnancy, turns into a crenulated luteal body (right). Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) has great advantages in\\nvisualizing the uterus and ovaries. It can also be used for non-gynaecological\\nconditions such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, etc. The use of transvaginal ultrasound will be dealt with in a\\ndifferent article: TVUS for non-gynaecological conditions.\\nAcute gynaecological conditions in pregnancy:\\nEctopic pregnancy:\\nIn:\\nthis young woman, US demonstrated a large quantity of clotted (C.) and liquified\\nblood (*) around the uterus, suspect for ectopic pregnancy.

A correct imaging diagnosis prevents an unnecessary operation or co\\nstful in-hospital observation. For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com\\nthe Appendix:\\nAppendicitis with periappendical fat infiltration.Click on the image to enlarge\\nNormal Appendix:\\nSonography and CT allow direct visualization of the normal or inflamed appendix. The normal appendix can be identified in 67-100% of patients without appendicitis who undergo CT [1]\\n. Fig. 1.- 34-year-old healthy volunteer with a normal appendix. A and B, longitudinal (A) and transverse (B) sonogram, showing the appendix (arrowheads) with a diameter less than t\\nhe 7 mm cut-off point, surrounded by normal noninflamed fat. At sonography the normal appendix is less frequently visualized, with results varying between 0-82% [1], reflecting the \\noperator dependency of sonography. One of the most important imaging criteria in the evaluation of appendicitis is the outer diameter of the appendix. Although an overlap of appendi\\nceal diameters in normal and inflamed appendices has been reported, a threshold value of 6-7 mm is most commonly used [1]. (Fig. 1). Fig. 2. A 50 year old man with a normal appendix\\n. Unenhanced CT shows an air-filled nondistended appendix (arrowhead) with homogeneous periappendiceal fat without fat-stranding. A normal appendix has a maximum outer diameter of 6\\n mm, is surrounded by homogeneous non-inflamed fat, and often contains intraluminal gas [2] (Fig. 2). Fig. 3. A 19 year old woman with appendicitis. Longitudinal and transverse sono\\ngram show an enlarged appendix (arrows) surrounded by hyperechoic inflamed fat (arrowheads).\\nAppendicitis:\\nAn inflamed appendix has a diameter larger than 6 mm, and is usually surrounded by hyperechoic inflamed fat at sonography (Fig. 3a). Other strongly supportive signs of inflammation \\ninclude the presence of an appendicolith, cecal apical thickening Fig. 3b. Power Doppler sonography shows hypervascularity of the appendiceal wall. Another supportive sign for appen\\ndicitis is hypervascularity of the appendix wall on color Doppler sonography [1] (Fig. 3b). Fig. 4.- 43-year-old man with appendicitis. Contrast-enhanced CT depicts a fluid-filled d\\nistended appendix (arrow) with periappendiceal fat-stranding. At CT the inflamed appendix is surrounded by fat-stranding (Fig. 4).\\nGastrointestinal nonsurgical mimics of Appendicitis:\\nFig. 5. A 14 year old boy with mesenteric adenitis. Sonogram of the right lower quadrant shows a cluster of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (arrowheads). The appendix was normal (no\\nt shown) and no other abnormalities were found.\\nMesenteric adenitis:\\nMesenteric adenitis has been reported to be the second most common cause of right lower quadrant pain after appendicitis, accounting for 2-14% of the discharge diagnoses in patients\\n with a clinical suspicion of appendicitis [3]. It is defined as a benign self-limiting inflammation of right-sided mesenteric lymph nodes without an identifiable underlying inflamm\\natory process, occurring more often in children than in adults. Sonography and CT show clustered adenopathy (Fig. 5). Fig 6.- 39-year-old man with bacterial ileocecitis. A and B, So\\nnography shows moderate mural thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum, surrounded by normal noninflamed fat. Moderate mesenteric lymphadenopathy was also present (not shown).\\nBacterial ileocecitis:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 305}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Because adenopathy also frequently occurs with appendicitis, the normal appendix must be confidently visualized on imaging studies before assigning a diagnosis of mesenteric adeniti\\ns. Infectious enterocolitis may cause mild symptoms resembling a common viral gastroenteritis, but it may also clinically present with features indistinguishable from appendicitis [\\n4]. This latter presentation may occur in bacterial ileocecitis, caused by Yersinia, Campylobacter, or Salmonella. Imaging studies show mural thickening of the terminal ileum and ce\\ncum without inflammation of the surrounding fat (Fig. 6), and moderate mesenteric adenopathy. Fig. 7.- 29-year-old woman with epiploic appendagitis. A, Sonography of the right lower\\n quadrant reveals a hyperechoic inflamed fatty mass (arrowheads) adjacent to the colon (arrow), at the spot of maximum tenderness. B, On unenhanced CT the fatty lesion contains a ch\\naracteristic hyperattenuating ring (arrow) corresponding to thickened visceral peritoneal lining.\\nEpiploic appendagitis:\\nEpiploic appendages are small adipose protrusions from the serosal surface of the colon. An epiploic appendage may undergo torsion and secondary inflammation, causing focal abdomina\\nl pain that simulates appendicitis when located in the right lower quadrant. Epiploic appendagitis is a self-limiting disease that has been reported in approximately 1% of patients \\nclinically suspected of having appendicitis [5]. Sonography and CT depict an inflamed fatty mass adjacent to the colon (Fig. 7), containing a characteristic hyperattenuating ring of\\n thickenend visceral peritoneal lining on CT [5]. Fig. 8.- 41-year-old man with omental infarction. A, Sonography of the right middle abdomen shows a large area of inflamed intraper\\nitoneal fat (arrowheads). B, Unenhanced CT depicts the lesion as a cake-like area of dense inflamed omental fat (arrowheads), larger than in epiploic appendagitis and lacking a hype\\nrattenuating ring.\\nOmental infarction:\\nOmental infarction has a pathophysiology and clinical presentation similar to that of epiploic appendagitis, with the infarcted fatty tissue being a right-sided segment of the oment\\num. Imaging shows a cakelike inflamed fatty mass (Fig. 8), larger than in epiploic appendagitis and lacking a hyperattenuating ring on CT. Fig. 9.- 47-year-old woman with acute righ\\nt lower quadrant pain. Unenhanced CT shows an ovoid inflamed fatty mass (arrowhead) with normal regional bowel loops. The shape and size of the lesion suggests epiploic appendagitis\\n, but the lesion does not contain a hyperattenuating ring. In this case, it is difficult to discriminate between epiploic appendagitis or a small omental infarction. In some cases i\\nt may be difficult to distinguish epiploic appendagitis from omental infarction (Fig. 9), however, this distinction has no clinical importance as both have a similar benign natural \\nhistory [5]. Fig. 10.- 51-year-old man with right-sided colonic diverticulitis. A, Unenhanced CT shows extensive with fat-standing along the cecal wall (arrowheads), and a normal ap\\npendix (arrow). B, Sonography reveals the cause of the inflammation by depicting an inflamed cecal diverticulum (arrow) centred in the hyperechoic fat.\\nRight-sided colonic diverticulitis:\\nRight-sided colonic diverticulitis may clinically mimic appendicitis or cholecystitis, though the patient's history is generally more protracted. In contrast to sigmoid diverticula,\\n right-sided colonic diverticula are usually true diverticula, that is, outpouchings of the colonic wall containing all layers of the wall. This may possibly explain the essentially\\n benign self- limiting character of right-sided diverticulitis [6]. Sonography and CT findings consist of inflammatory changes in the pericolic fat with segmental thickening of the \\ncolonic wall, at the level of an inflamed diverticulum (Fig. 10). Fig. 11.- 28-year-old man with acute ileocecal Crohn disease.A and B, Sonography shows transmural wall thickening o\\nf the terminal ileum (arrows) in longitudinal (A) and transverse (B) section, with hyperechoic inflammatory changes of the surrounding fat (arrowheads).C, Contrast-enhanced CT confi\\nrms the wall thickening and luminal narrowing of the terminal and pre-terminal ileum (arrowheads), with regional fat-stranding.\\nCrohn disease:\\nCrohn disease often causes long-standing symptoms, but up to one third of patients with ileocecal Crohn disease present with initial symptoms so acute that they are misdiagnosed as \\nappendicitis [7]. In the acute active phase of ileocecal Crohn disease, imaging shows transmural bowel wall thickening, often predominantly of the submucosal layer, with frequent in\\nflammatory changes of the surrounding fat (Fig. 11). Uncomplicated Crohn disease can initially be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.\\nOther nonsurgical mimics of appendicitis:\\nFig. 12.- 39-year-old woman with pelvic inflammatory disease.A, Endovaginal sonography shows an inhomogeneously enlarged right ovary (arrowheads).B and C, Contrast-enhanced CT shows\\n enlargement of the ovaries (B, arrows) with ill-defined contours of the ovaries and uterus, and some free pelvic fluid (C, arrow).\\nGynecologic conditions:\\nGynecologic conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease or a hemorrhagic functional ovarian cyst can cause acute pelvic pain that may simulate appendicitis. In pelvic inflammator\\ny disease the imaging findings vary according to the severity of the disease, and may be normal in early conditions. In more advanced stages, findings may include enlargement of the\\n internal genital organs with indistinct contours, and free pelvic fluid (Fig.\\n12). In absence of a drainable tubo-ovarian abscess, treatment is medically with antibiotics. An hemorrhagic ovarian cysts appears as a complicated cyst at sonography and a high- at\\ntenuation adnexal mass at unenhanced CT, and does not require any treatment. Fig. 13. 77-year-old man with a right ureteral stone.Unenhanced CT shows an obstructing calcification (a\\nrrow) within the distal ureteral lumen.\\nUrolithiasis:\\nUrolithiasis may present with right lower quadrant pain when obstruction is caused by a distal ureteral stone. Unenhanced CT (Fig. 13) is more accurate in detecting ureteral stones \\nthan sonography, Fig. 14. 40-year-old woman with a ureteral stone.A and B, Sonography shows right-sided hydronephrosis (A), and an obstructing calculus (B, arrow) in the distal uret\\ner at the level of the iliac vessels. Ultrasound may show both hydronephrosis and hydroureter as signs of obstruction (Fig. 14). Fig. 15.- 68-year-old woman with a rectus sheath hem\\natoma.A, Sonography depicts a small painfull lesion (arrow) within the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle in the right lower quadrant. The lesion contains a fluid-fluid level.B, \\nUnenhanced CT depicts the lesion as a partly hyperdense mass (arrow) within the rectus sheath.\\nRectus sheath hematoma:\\nA rectus sheath hematoma may be easy to diagnose in patients presenting with a painful palpable mass under anticoagulant therapy, however, small nonpalpable hematomas may clinically\\n masquerade as appendicitis and also occur in patients without anticoagulantia [8]. Sonography and CT show a hemorrhagic mass within the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle (Fig. \\n15). No treatment is required other than adjusting any anticoagulant therapy.\\nConclusion:\\nA broad spectrum of nonsurgical diseases may clinically present as appendicitis in patients without appendicitis. The radiologist should be aware of the sonographic and CT features \\nof these alternative disorders, as a correct imaging diagnosis prevents an unwarranted operation and unnecessary hospital resource use.\\nNone:\\nCT in Abdominal Trauma:\\nStephen Ledbetter and Robin Smithuis\\nDepartment of Radiology of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston and the Rijnland Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 306}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Publicationdate 2007-08-02 / update 2022-07-07 This review is based on a presentation given by Stephen Ledbetter and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Steph\\nen Ledbetter is director of the emergency radiology department of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, which is a teaching affiliate of the Harvard Medical School. This revie\\nw will focus on the role of CT in the evaluation of patients with traumatic abdominal injuries. Some of the cases will be presented in an interactive way.\\nIntroduction:\\nClick to enlarge Trauma is the leading cause of death under the age of forty. Of all traumatic deaths, abdominal trauma is responsible for 10%. The findings to look for in abdominal\\n trauma are the following: Nowadays there is a trend towards non-operative management of blunt abdominal trauma. More than 50% of splenic injury, 80% of liver injury and virtually a\\nll renal injurys are managed non-operatively, because patients proved to have better outcomes on the long term related to visceral salvage. CT is used to evaluate patients with blun\\nt trauma not only initially, but also for follow up, when patients are treated non-operatively. CT is also used to clear patients before they are dismissed from the ER, because CT h\\nas a very high negative predictive value and can rule out injury. These patients do not have to be admitted for observation.\\nThe sensitivity and specificity of CT in blunt abdominal injury is 96 to 100% and 94 to 100%, respectively. CT is also increasingly used for penetrating trauma, which traditionally \\nwas evaluated operatively, but the CT-results should be interpreted with caution as the sensitivity and specificity in penetrating abdominal injury is lower than for blunt trauma (3\\n1.3% to 100% and 81 to 84%, respectively).\\nIn haemodynamically unstable patients there is already an indication for surgery and you may wanna skip the CT, unless to determine the damage outside the perioperative visual range\\n.\\nCT Protocol:\\nMultiphase CT:\\nIn the original article in 2007 the standard method of scanning was the venous phase at 70 seconds post injection and in some cases a subsequent delayed excretory scan 3-5 minutes l\\nater if injury was detected on the initial scan. Nowadays the importance of the arterial scan is recognized.\\nHere we present the protocol and indications as advised by the radiological society of the Netherlands. A multi-phase CT abdomen is an accurate form of imaging for the diagnosis or \\nexclusion of vascular injury or active intra-abdominal hemorrhage. \\nIn addition, the scan in the arterial phase can serve as a “roadmap” for the interventional radiologist or the vascular surgeon. The alternative can be a so-called split-bolus scan \\n(arterial phase and venous phase combined in one scan). The disadvantage of such scans is that it can be more difficult to detect a contrast extravasation due to the lack of a tempo\\nral phase difference and the potentially reduced visibility of arteries compared to the pure arterial scan. \\nThe advantage of such a scan is the lower radiation dose.\\nSecretory CT:\\nFor the detection of lesions of the collecting system of the kidneys, ureteral and bladder lesions, venous phase CT is moderately sensitive. The sensitivity is increased by adding a\\n secretion phase after 7 to 10 minutes. In the table the indication for an additional scan in the excretory phase are listed. Oral contrast can sometimes help to diagnose hollow org\\nan lesions, but did not proof to increase the sensitivity of CT abdomen without oral contrast and is therefore not indicated.\\nSpleen:\\nClick to enlarge The spleen is the most commonly injured solid organ (25%). The finding of contrast extravasation  has great impact on the patients management, because when there is\\n active bleeding, there will be failure of non-operative management in 80% of the cases. In these patients the need for intervention is almost ten times as high compared to patients\\n without extravasation. The table shows the CT findings in the spleen injury scale. Vascular injury is defined as a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula and appears as a focal co\\nllection of vascular contrast that decreases in attenuation with delayed imaging. Active bleeding from a vascular injury presents as vascular contrast, focal or diffuse, that increa\\nses in size or attenuation in delayed phase. Vascular thrombosis can lead to organ infarction. The spleen injury grade is based on the highest grade assessment made on imaging, at o\\nperation or on pathologic specimen.

Case 4\\nThere are lacerations and also active bleeding with a contrast blush with the density within the range of the density of the aorta. There also is hemoperitoneum, so this patient wil\\nl probably need surgery.\\nLiver:\\nLiver laceration with active bleeding In trauma the liver is the second most commonly involved solid organ in the abdomen after the spleen. However liver injury is the most common c\\nause of death. This is due to the fact that there are many major vessels in the liver, like the IVC, hepatic veins, hepatic artery and portal vein. It is important to remember, espe\\ncially if you are doing ultrasound, that the posterior segment of the right liver lobe is the most frequently injured part. This part also involves the bare area and this can lead t\\no retroperitoneal bleeding rather than bleeding into the peritoneal cavity. Liver injury. The arrows indicate different types of injury.

First look at the images on the left of a patient with liver injury. What are the C\\nT findings in this case? The findings are the following: First look at the images on the left of a patient with liver injury. What are the CT findings in this case? The findings are\\n the following: So despite the fact that there is a contrast extravasation, this patient will be treated non-operatively and probably will do fine, because there is no bleeding into\\n the peritoneal cavity. Contrast extravasation is of great importance especially if it is associated with hemoperitoneum. Liver lacerations On the left two more examples of lacerati\\non. Lacerations can be stellate, like the example on the left or branching like the one on the right. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll First look at the images on the left of a patient with liver injury. Questions: There is i.v. contrast and images were taken in the portal phase. There is also oral c\\nontrast filling of the stomach. The contrast surrounding the liver could be a result of stomach or bowel perforation, but since there was no pneumoperitoneum, this was thought to be\\n unlikely. So the extravasation was thought to be a result of active bleeding and since there is a great amount of contrast surrounding the liver, this was thought to be a huge leak\\n. At the OR an avulsed right hepatic vein was found. This diagnosis has a 90-100% mortality and this patient died in the OR.

No sensat\\nion or movement in lower extremities. Gun shot wound entry in right upper quadrant. No hematuria. The white object within the spinal column (yellow arrow) is a bullet fragment. Pene\\ntrating injury Look at the images on the left and try to answer the following questions: Answers: Findings: There is also a hematoma in the perirenal space.\\n+ In the delayed phase there is more extravasation, although it is not clear whether that is due to the active bleeding or contrast comming out of the collecting system\\n+ In the extretory phase it is clear that there is violation of the collecting system The next question is, whether the protocol is correct or do we need to give rectal contrast to \\nsee if there is bowelperforation, because there is a penetrating trauma? In this case the answer is no, do not give this patient rectal contrast. The reason is that we already have \\nreached the treshold for this patient to go to the OR. There are 3 reasons for this patient to go to surgery: If rectal contrast was given at the start of the examination, this migh\\nt pose the problem that it would have been unclear, whether the contrast deposition was due to active bleeding or bowel perforation. So the bleeding could have been missed. Rectal c\\nontrast should only have been given if there were no other findings in need of surgery. Although this patient had severe renal injury, there was no hematuria. This is often the case\\n in penetrating trauma and does not rule out renal injury. In blunt trauma however the abcense of hematuria does rule out renal injury. Knife stab in the right flank On the left ano\\nther patient with a penetrating injury due to a knife stab in the flank. The CT demonstrates nicely, that the injury is limited to the retroperitoneal space with a small renal hemat\\noma. There is no sign of peritoneal violation and on delayed images (not shown) there was no extravasation of the collecting system. This patient will be treated non-operatively Blu\\nnt injury In 90% of cases there will be renal injury due to blunt trauma. Unlike in injury to the spleen and the liver, in renal trauma we also need to evaluate the collecting syste\\nm. Renal injury scale according to the Organ Injury Scale of the American Association of Surgery of Trauma (AAST) The grading system on the left has proven to be of value in the man\\nagement of the patient. However unlike the grading for spleen and liver injury it is not that simple to remember. In grade I there is nothing wrong with the parenchyma, just contusi\\non or subcapsular hematoma. Grade II and III injuries are either less or greater than 1 cm lacerations, but with no injury to the collecting system. Grade IV is injury to the collec\\nting system or large lacerations> Grade V is a shattered or devascularized kidney. First look at the images on the left of a patient with renal injury after a blunt trauma. What is \\nthe CT grade of injury? The answer is, that like all grading systems, this system also has its limitations. What we see on the left is not a laceration, because it is not linear. It\\n is not a contusion, because it is sharply demarcated. This is an post traumatic segmental infarction. On the left a typical subcapsular hematoma, which is also a grade I renal inju\\nry. Some final remarks on renal injury: Click to enlarge\\nCategories of Renal Injuries:\\nMichael Federle placed renal injuries into four categories:\\nBladder:\\nOn the left a 65-year old male struck by a car traveling at moderate speed. Loss of consciousness for 2 minutes. A foley catheter was passed and there was gross hematuria. The x-ray\\n shows a moderately displaced fracture of the pubic bone with bony spicules in the bladder region. So the question is: For what other pelvic injuries is this patient at risk and how\\n will it affect our protocol? First this patient is at risk for arterial injury with pelvic hematoma, rectal, vaginal injury and bladder injury. Secondly, a CT-cystogram is indicate\\nd after the routine CT. On the left the images of the routine trauma-CT. What are the findings? There is a displaced pelvic fracture with a spicule pointing towards the bladder. The\\nre is fluid in the prevesicle space (space of Rezius). If there is a pelvic fracture the chance of a bladder rupture is 10%. If there is a bladder rupture, there is almost always a \\npelvic fracture. First it was thought that the rupture was caused by the pelvic fracture itself, but now we know that only in one third of cases the bladder rupture is at the site o\\nf the bone spicule. Two third of rupture occur at the opposite site, meaning that shearing forces play a significant role in bladder injuries. On the left the pre- and post-cystogra\\nm images. There is contrast in the bladder surrounding the foley catheter and there is extravasation of contrast in the prevesicle space or space of Rezius. This has been referred t\\no as the 'molar tooth sign' indicating extraperitoneal bladder rupture. On the left a sagittal and coronal reconstruction. Notice that there is no contrast extending into the perico\\nlic gutter, so there is no intraperitoneal extention. The sensitivity and specificity of CT Cystography is very high. For extraperitoneal rupture it is respectively 100% and 99% and\\n for intraperitoneal rupture it is 92% and 100%. The most important factor is that you have to have good distention of the bladder.\\nCT Cystography:\\nFirst we drain the bladder, because we want to get rid of the urine and contrast that was excreted by the kidneys. The contrast solution that we use is the same as we use for oral o\\nr rectal contrast (i.e. 50 cc contrast in 1L saline). We instill the contrast retrograde through the foley catheter until one of three things happen: On the left another case to ill\\nustrate why you do not administer contrast in the bladder at the same time as the administration of iv. contrast. The next question that comes up, is whether we should perform an ad\\nditional CT-cystogram? The answer to the first question is that if you would have administered contrast to the bladder at the start of the examination, you would have been puzzled w\\nhether the contrast that is seen is due to a bladder rupture or to active bleeding. Since no contrast was instilled in the bladder, it is obvious, that this is arterial bleeding. Se\\ncondly because of the enormous extravasation, this patient is in need of immediate embolisation without further delay.\\nPancreas:\\nConcerning pancreatic injury the following remarks can be made: On the left an unrestrained driver who had a car accident. Vital signs were stable and there was only a mildly tender\\n abdomen. First look at the images on the left and then continue.

So the radiologist said that there was concern about pancreatic inj\\nury. The reason that he was not more definitive was that, an isolated pancreatic injury is exceptionally rare, since the pancreas is protected by the liver and spleen and the bony t\\nhorax. During follow up this patient experienced more pain and on a follow up scan (not shown) there was impressive accumulation of fluid around the pancreas. So this patient had an\\n isolated pancreatic injury. The case above is an exceptional case. When the pancreas is involved in a trauma, it is almost always part of a package injury (Table). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll The more common presentation of pancreatic injury is what is seen on the left. Scroll through the images and describe the findings.

Right sided package injury involving the pancreas. On the left \\nanother common presentation of pancreatic injury. Look at the images and describe the findings. Then continue. There is a right sided package injury. There is a liver laceration cro\\nssing the major vessels associated with a transsection of the pancreas at the junction of the head and the body. The force must have come from the right anterior side squeezing the \\nliver and the pancreas against the spine. Sometimes this kind of injury also involves the duodenum.\\nDiafragmatic injury:\\nOn the left a chest film of a 79-year old restrained driver who had a car accident. Initially unresponsive at the scene. He was transferred from an outside hospital after placement \\nof tubes. Look at the image on the left and describe the findings. Then continue. The first thing you'll notice is that the tube is in the right main bronchus. Chest tube looks okay\\n. Nasogastric tube comes down and coils in the stomach. The superior mediastinum looks widened and indistinct, so this certainly has to be evaluated. In the left lower zone we have \\nan indistinct diafragmatic border and an opacity. This could be a lot of things like hematothorax, lung contusion, diafragmatic rupture or splenic injury. So based on the chest film\\n we are conceirned about possible aortic injury, pulmonary contusion and injury to the diaphragm, spleenic and left kidney. Continue with the CT images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images on the left. What contrast is on board adn wh at are the findings? There is i.v. contrast in the late arterial phase and when we follow the \\nnasogastric tube we will notice that there is no contrast in the stomach. The most important finding in this case is the area of soft tissue density next to the atelectatic lower lo\\nbe of the lung and lateral to it an amount of fat. This is very suggestive of diafragmatic rupture. What can we do to get more certainty about this structure? Since the nasogastric \\ntube is in place, we can administer contrast to the stomach. The images on the left prove that the structure is the stomach, which is in a high position. Secondly there is a waist i\\nn the stomach compatible with the 'collar sign'. These findings are specific for diafragmatic rupture.\\nCT 'collar' sign:\\nOn the left the coronal reconstruction of the same patient demonstrating the 'collar sign', where the stomach passes through the diafragmatic rupture. So in the case above specific \\nsigns of diafragmatic injury are present. Non-specific signs are discontinuity or thickening of the diafragm or the 'dependent viscera' sign. 'Dependent viscera' sign in left-sided \\ndiafragmatic rupture\\n'Dependent viscera' sign:\\nOn the left a demonstration of the 'dependent viscera' sign. On the left side there clearly is a diafragmatic rupture with herniation of the stomach. Notice that the stomach and the\\n spleen lie against the posterior thoracic wall, which is abnormal. This is unlike on the right side where the liver is away from the chest wall due to the presence of the diafragm.\\n Chest film in a patient with right-sided injury. On the left a patient with a right-sided injury. On the chest film it looks as if there is just elevation of the hemidiafragm or ma\\nybe there is a subpulmonic pleural fluid collection. There also could be a baseline diafragmatic paralysis. Now continue with the CT images. 'Collar' sign in right-sided diafragmati\\nc rupture Describe the findings on the left and then continue. The axial image demonstrates that the opacity on the chest film is actually the liver. As we follow the livercontour, \\nthere is this unusual shape (yellow arrow). There is discontinuity of the crus which is a non-specific sign (small blue arrow). On the axial image there is indentation of the liver \\non the posterior side due to blood in the thorax. On the sagittal MPR there is indentation of the liver and the 'collar' sign is nicely demonstrated.

However when there are multiple bilateral infarcts, we have to think of an embolic source.\\n The most common location after injury for these emboli is in the thoracic aorta at the isthmus, because the aorta is fixated there. In this patient however the source was a traumat\\nic dissection of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm. This is the second most common location for injury to the aorta due to the relative fixation. .\\nBowel injury:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Multiple injuries due to 40 feet fall.

The findings are: The questions in this patient are: Concerning pneumoperitoneum some important re\\nmarks have to be made: In fact the most common findings in small bowel injury are non-specific findings like thickening of the bowel wall and unexplained intraperitoneal fluid. In t\\nhe patient that we discussed the diffuse wall thickening was only a result of hypoperfusion or 'shock' bowel due to the active bleeding. Direct injury to the bowel wall usually resu\\nlts in focal thickening and is mostly a non-transmural injury. It is very uncommon to identify findings that are specific for bowel injury like extravasation of oral contrast or bow\\nel content. More commonly you will find a combination of intraperitoneal fluid and mesenteric stranding, focal bowel thickening or interloop fluid, that is very suggestive for bowel\\n injury. by Akira Kawashima, MD, Carl M.

For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com\\nNormal anatomy:\\nCourtesy: Dr. Netter\\nHistology of the GI tract:\\nFrom inside to outside the layers of the small bowel are the mucosa (M.), the submucosa (S.M.), the circular muscle layer (C.M.), the longitudinal muscle layer (L.M.) and the serosa\\n (S.)\\nUS fingerprint of the normal GI tract:\\nThe classic five-layer-US-structure of the bowel wall is easiest apprehended  by studying the wall of  the fluid filled stomach. The layers, starting from inside to outside, are hyp\\ner-hypo-hyper-hypo-hyper-echoic or white-black-white-black-white. The US architecture of the wall is essentially the same from the stomach to the rectum. Superficial mucosa The supe\\nrficial mucosa is brightly hyperechoic, due to mucus and very tiny air-particles caught between the small intestinal villi. It is not separately identifiable, when it blends with hy\\nperechoic feces, as in this US image of the colon. The outer white serosa can only be identified when there is ascites. When a high frequency probe is used, the middle three layers,\\n deep mucosa, submucosa and muscularis (black-white-black) are always visible. In this patient with severe coprostasis, the three-layer wall architecture could only be recognized wi\\nth a 12 MHz probe. Deep Mucosa The deep mucosa is hypoechoic and has a variable thickness. It represents the packed glandular tissue and - for only a small part-  the muscularis muc\\nosae. Especially in the terminal ileum of children and young adults, prominent echolucent lymphoid tissue is found in the deep mucosa. These so-called Peyer’s patches (p) may be imp\\nressively large and asymmetrical. Submucosa The submucosa contains vessels, nerves and fat and is hyperechoic due to abundant loose connective tissue. In this patient with ulcerativ\\ne colitis, prominent vessels (arrows) in the submucosa are visualized and proven with color Doppler in the right image. The submucosa “loosely connects” the mucosa with the muscular\\nis, and during contraction, the submucosa can be seen to follow the mucosal folds (left upper). After drinking water, the mucosa and submucosa are stretched and unfolded (right uppe\\nr). This loose connection also explains why gastroscopical biopsies can be taken unpunished, especially when the submucosa is injected with saline first (right under). Muscularis Th\\ne muscularis is hypoechoic due to muscular tissue and as outer black layer is easy to identify. It consists of  two layers: an inner circular muscle layer and an outer longitudinal \\nmuscle layer, which cooperate to produce peristaltic movements. These two muscular layers are separated by a thin layer of connective tissue, containing the neural tissue of the Aue\\nrbach plexus. This thin layer (arrowheads) is hyperechoic on US and can be seen in the small bowel of lean patients. Although clinically not relevant, the separate US identification\\n of the Auerbach plexus, underlines the high resolution of US compared to CT and MRI. (M= muscularis, BV= Bloodvessels, S= serosa, TC= tenia coli) The muscularis of the large bowel \\nis different from that of the small bowel. The longitudinal muscle layer is limited to three longitudinally oriented bands, known as teniae coli. In the empty, compressed colon in t\\nhin patients, these three teniae (arrowheads), can often be identified by US as a local thickening of the muscular layer, separated from the circular layer by a thin hyperechoic lin\\ne. In this longitudinal view only one tenia coli (arrowheads) is identified. Serosa The serosa or visceral peritoneum is the thin but tough outer hyperechoic layer, which usually bl\\nends with the hyperechoic fatty tissue of mesentery and omentum, surrounding  the bowel. If there is intraperitoneal fluid, the hyperechoic serosa (arrow) can be separately identifi\\ned, as in these ileal loops.\\nStomach:\\nIn most patients referred for US, the stomach is empty, either  because they have been asked not to drink too much prior to the examination, or because they have vomited associated \\nwith their acute abdominal problem. If the stomach is fluid-filled and  the patient denies previous drinking, this is a relevant finding. It may be mechanical obstruction,  gastric \\nparesis or hypersecretion with stasis due to active peptic ulcer disease. Antrum and duodenal bulb are the parts of the stomach best identified by US. The pylorus is recognized as a\\n local thickening of the muscularis distally to the antrum. The wall of the duodenal bulb is thinner than that of the stomach. Gastric fluid can be used to improve visualization of \\n the antrum and duodenal area, by turning patients on their right side: air rises to the gastric fundus, and fluid enters antrum and duodenal bulb. This is especially helpful in adu\\nlts with  peptic ulcer disease. The left image shows a gastric ulcer (arrow). Note the loss of layer structure in the ventral stomach wall and the inflamed fat (asterisks) represent\\ning the omentum and mesentery, trying to wall-off the imminent perforation from this deep penetrating gastric ulcer. The right image shows an ulcer (arrow) in the ventral wall of th\\ne fluid-filled duodenal bulb. Descending and horizontal duodenum are rarely accessible for US. When specifically looked for,  large air-filled duodenal diverticula, present in 10-15\\n % of the normal population,  can be identified. They present as a (curvi)linear reflection within the pancreatic head. Note that these patients often have a wider common bile duct \\nthan normal patients.

Note multiple small round echolucencies with a h\\nyperechoic border within the bright submucosa. These represent normal 0.4 – 0.5 mm vessels. Note also the thin hyperechoic line within the muscularis, representing the connective ti\\nssue separating the longitudinal and circular muscle layer, containing the Auerbach plexus. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Normal small bowel in the longitudinal plane.\\nJejunum:\\nThe jejunum (left image) is mainly located in the LUQ, and contains more Kerckring’s folds (valvulae conniventes) than the ileum (right image), which is more located in the RLQ. Mea\\nsuring bowel wall thickness with US is difficult because thickness changes with peristaltic movements. In this individual, measurements in the longitudinal plane (upper panel)  and \\nin the axial plane during light compression (left under) vary considerably, but during moderate compression (right under) measurements are well reproducible and accurate. As the thi\\nn hyperechoic serosa is rarely discernible, bowel wall thickness is  measured from the outer contour of the ventral muscularis to the outer contour of the dorsal muscularis, and the\\nn of course, divided by two. Normally, single small bowel wall thickness during compression is about 1.5 - 2.5 mm. Measuring bowel wall thickness by US this way  is reproducible and\\n comparable to what surgeons do with their fingers during laparotomy to decide whether small bowel is abnormal. In contrast to most diseased bowel loops, normal small bowel loops ar\\ne well compressible during relaxation. Compare a normal terminal ileum (left) and a Crohn’s ileum (right), without compression (upper images) and with compression (lower images). No\\nte the same cm-scale in all four US-images.

              " Document(page_content='Terminal ileum:\\nThe terminal ileum can often be identified separately due to its specific location and course from the pelvis toward the paracolic gutter. The  actual discharging of the normal term\\ninal ileum into the cecum can only be seen in thin patients with an empty cecum. The location of the ileocecal valve may vary widely, but its average location is right of the umbili\\ncus. Note the lymphoid hyperplasia of the Peyer’s patches in the terminal ileum.

These are images of the terminal ileum in three different children\\n and young adults with large Peyer’s patches presenting as asymmetrical, hypoechoic thickening of the deep mucosa. With every new antigen, the lymphoid tissue becomes reactivated. I\\nn young patients both mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches are –also in absolute dimensions- much larger than in adults. The stimulated lymphoid tissue in youngsters not only \\nresults in prominent Peyer’s patches in the terminal ileum and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (left under), but also in a thickened deep mucosa of the appendix (right under). Note \\nthat the –sometimes polyp-like- protrusions (right upper), may act as lead-point in the classic ileocecal intussusception in young children\\nIntussusception:\\nHere the US image in a 2 year-old child with intermittent ileocecal intussusception, examined in between attacks. The ileum with abundant Peyer’s patches shows prolaps into the cecu\\nm. Classic US image of ileocecal intussusceptions in two different children. In both, the intussuscepted ileum is asymmetrically positioned within the intussuscipiens, due to the hy\\nperechoic fatty mesentery, attached to the ileum and following the ileum, when pulled in. Within the mesentery US shows an enlarged mesenteric lymph node (ln) in both. These nodes a\\nre enlarged as part of the general lymphoid hyperplasia and are not localised in the ileal lumen. Therefore it is not the primary lead point. In the patient on the right, the append\\nix (arrow) is pulled in also. Note  the multi-layered aspect of the ventral wall of the intussusception complex, representing three folded bowel wall layers. Although the lymphoid t\\nissue in the terminal ileum is most impressive in the young child, it may be found until the age of 20 years. In this young man of 15 years with an acute appendicitis (arrowheads), \\nthere are still prominent Peyer’s patches (p.) in the deep mucosa of the terminal ileum. During US examination, it is not unusual to witness a small, transient, ileo-ileal intussusc\\neption. Apart from lack of symptoms, these can be discriminated by US  from the real symptomatic intussusception, because they are smaller (< 2 cm), compressible, transient and have\\n no lead point. These transient intussusceptions may be associated with celiac disease and it is important to exclude this condition with blood tests.\\nOmentum, mesentery and lymph nodes:\\nThe normal omentum is usually not separately visible. When it is thickened e.g. in malignant or, more rarely, in tuberculous peritonitis, it may present as omental cake, especially \\nif there is concomitant ascites. US can also visualize the omentum (arrowheads)  in segmental omental infarction, in which the omentum is swollen due to venous hemorrhagic infarctio\\nn. The small bowel is attached to the mesentery which is folded like a fan. The mesentery contains a variable amount of fat, and the folded, fatty mesentery has a multi-layered aspe\\nct, especially when compressed during US. The normal mesentery (arrows)  in thin patients is only visible when there is ascites. In the obese, the mesentery contains a lot of fat an\\nd can be visualized as a well-compressible, flat, multi-layered structure. In one plane this may simulate a thickened bowel wall (arrows in left image) . Turning the probe 90 degree\\ns (right image), it is immediately recognized as a flat structure (arrows). Click image for animation. At the edge of the fatty mesentery, vivid peristalsis in two small bowel loops\\n can be visualized. Click image for animation.\\nEpiploic appendages:\\nNext to mesentery and omentum, also the properitoneal fat is part of the intra-abdominal fatty tissue, as are the epiploic appendages (arrows). They have a fragile blood supply (whi\\nte arrowheads) , prone to hemorrhagic infarction (epiploic appendagitis). Normal epiploic appendages are only visible on US and CT  in case of ascites. Within the mesentery the mese\\nnteric lymph nodes can be visualized, predominantly in the region right of the umbilicus. During graded compression in thin patients the nodes appear very close to psoas muscle and \\niliac vessels. The dimensions of the normal mesenteric lymph node are variable, in this case the dimensions in three planes are 3 x 11 x 16 mm. Although transverse and longitudinal \\ndiameters may even be larger, the shortest axial diameter in adults should not exceed 5 mm. In case of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, it is -initially- only the shortest axial dia\\nmeter that increases. Therefore, to decide whether a node is normal or abnormal, measuring the shortest axial diameter suffices. The shape of  a normal versus an abnormal mesenteric\\n lymph node, is that of an almond versus an olive. In children, especially those of 5 to 10 years old, the mesenteric lymph nodes are much larger than in adults, with short axial di\\nameters up to 10 mm. These large mesenteric lymph nodes in children, may be associated with viral infections, but can be found in otherwise healthy kids. Normal mesenteric lymph nod\\nes have a relatively hyperechoic center and a lobulated, echolucent peripheral zone, representing the germinal centers.\\nAppendix:\\nAn experienced sonographer can identify  the entire normal appendix -including the blind end-  in about 30 % of adult patients and 80 % of children. US visualization of the entire n\\normal appendix, excludes appendicitis. The normal appendix has the same layers as in normal bowel wall. In this young woman all five layers are visible including the serosa, thanks \\nto a little intraperitoneal fluid. Note the empty lumen and the normal triangle-shaped hyperechoic meso-appendix. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll To compress the appendix, a rather firm underground is mandatory like iliac artery, psoas muscle or vertebral body. The normal appendix  (arrowheads) is discriminated\\n from small bowel by its location, its size, its absence of peristalsis, its attachment to the cecal pole (c.p.) and its blind distal end (arrows). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll The blind end of the normal appendix is firmly demonstrated using a “mini-clip”. The US diameter of the appendix is measured the same way as bowel: during moderate co\\nmpression from outer contour of the ventral muscularis to the outer contour of the dorsal muscularis. Thus measured, the diameter of this normal appendix (left)  is 4.5 mm and of th\\nis inflamed appendix (right) 8.5 mm. In many textbooks a cut-off value of 6 mm is reported, however this is not a reliable value. Rettenbacher (Radiology 2001; 218: 757-62) did a la\\nrge study and  found that  the diameter of the normal appendix was 6 mm or larger in 27 % of cases, with a range of 2-13 mm. The US criteria of appendicitis will be discussed  in a \\nspecial chapter on appendicitis. CT measurements overestimate the appendix diameter compared to US. In the literature the mean CT diameter of a normal appendix is 6.5- 8 mms (range,\\n 3 to14 mm). The explanation for this discrepancy may be that on CT: The left panel here shows a CT of a normal, feces-filled appendix of 8.5 mm. The middle  panel  is a US image of\\n a comparable normal appendix in a different patient measuring 7.5 mm, the right panel shows that same appendix during compression (5.5.mm). The literature indicates that the US dia\\nmeter of the normal appendix is 6 mms or less in 73  % of cases. Here you see the normal appendix during compression in ten different patients with AP-diameters varying from 2-10 mm\\n (Note the same cm-scale). In the lower five, the lumen is filled with fecal material of various reflectivity, which make the appendix less compressible. The most important discrimi\\nnating feature indicating appendicitis is inflamed fat, followed by diameter, non-compressibility, hyperemia and a fixed position. There are of course additional US features in adva\\nnced appendicitis, as fluid collections and loss of layer structure, but in these cases it is clear that the appendix is inflamed. More rarely, some intraluminal fluid is seen, in w\\nhich case the appendix is easily compressible. Not rarely, the blind ending tip  (arrowheads) of the normal appendix has no lumen due to fibrosis. Unlike the inflamed appendix, the \\nnormal appendix has no fixed position and during the US examination may appear in different places in the abdominal cavity. If lying in a curved position, the individual sections (a\\nrrows) are close to each other, in contrast to the inflamed appendix that becomes more rigid and stretches to some extent.

The patient was symptom free at the time of the\\n US examination, but he recalled four,  one-day-lasting, self-limiting episodes of severe RLQ pain over the past nine months, suggestive for recurrent acute appendicitis. After appe\\nndectomy he had no more attacks. In children, the deep mucosa may show remarkable hypoechoic thickening due to lymphoid hyperplasia, which may also render the appendix less compress\\nible. This is a common finding in healthy kids, but in case of very prominent hyperplasia, a viral infection may be present. Note the complete absence of inflamed fat.\\nColon:\\nLongitudinal (left) and transverse (right) image of the empty sigmoid in a lean patient. In the transverse image three areas of local thickening of the muscularis (arrowheads) repre\\nsent the three teniae coli (arrowheads). Normal colon filled with feces (left), during contraction (middle) and during relaxation and compression (right). Normal colon wall thicknes\\ns during compression is 3-4 mms. Acoustic shadowing of the feces prevents US visualization of the  posterior wall (left). Colon is distinguished from small bowel by location, fecal \\ncontents, scarce peristalsis and  a thick outer muscle layer with three tenia coli. The muscularis of the sigmoid may considerably vary in thickness, mainly due to contraction. Perm\\nanent thickening of the muscularis is associated with the development of diverticula (arrows). Sigmoid diverticulosis in four different patients. Feces-filled diverticula are best v\\nisualized when the colon is contracted. They present as bright reflective structures with an acoustic shadow on the outer contour of the colon. Note the variable thickness of the mu\\nscularis in these four patients.

Note the very thin wall of the diverticulum, consisting of herniated (sub)mucosa covered by a very thin serosa. The herniation through the muscularis\\n, invariably occurs at a weak spot where the vessels penetrate the circular muscle layer, immediately next to the tenia coli (arrowheads). These penetrating vessels are identified b\\ny color Doppler in another very lean patient (left under) and illustrated in the Netter image right under.

Read more about coronary anatomy inIntroduction to cardiothoracic imaging\\nLeft Coronary Artery (LCA):\\nLeft coronary (LC), right coronary (RC) and posterior non-coronary (NC) cusp The left coronary artery (LCA) is also known as the left main. The LCA arises from the left coronary cus\\np. The aortic valve has three leaflets, each having a cusp or cup-like configuration. These are known as the left coronary cusp (L), the right coronary cusp (R) and the posterior no\\nn-coronary cusp (N). Just above the aortic valves there are anatomic dilations of the ascending aorta, also known as the sinus of Valsalva.\\nThe left aortic sinus gives rise to the left coronary artery. The right aortic sinus which lies anteriorly, gives rise to the right coronary artery. The non-coronary sinus is postio\\nned on the right side. LCA divides into LAD and Cx The LCA divides almost immediately into the circumflex artery (Cx) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). On the left an axial\\n CT-image. The LCA travels between the right ventricle outflow tract anteriorly and the left atrium posteriorly and divides into LAD and Cx. On the image on the left we see the left\\n main artery dividing into On volume rendered images the left atrial appendage needs to be removed to get a good look on the LCA. In 15% of cases a third branch arises in between th\\ne LAD and the Cx, known as the ramus intermedius or intermediate branch. This intermediate branche behaves as a diagonal branch of the Cx.\\nLeft Anterior Descending (LAD):\\nCT image of the LAD in RAO projection The LAD travels in the anterior interventricular groove and continues up to the apex of the heart. The LAD supplies the anterior part of the se\\nptum with septal branches and the anterior wall of the left ventricle with diagonal branches. The LAD supplies most of the left ventricle and also the AV-bundle. Mnemonic: Diagonal \\nbranches arise from the LAD. The diagonal branches come off the LAD and run laterally to supply the antero-lateral wall of the left ventricle. The first diagonal branch serves as th\\ne boundary between the proximal and mid portion of the LAD (2). There can be one or more diagonal branches: D1, D2 , etc.\\nCircumflex (Cx):\\nCircumflex and LAD seen in Lateral projection The Cx lies in the left AV groove between the left atrium and left ventricle and supplies the vessels of the lateral wall of the left v\\nentricle. These vessels are known as obtuse marginals (M1, M2...), because they supply the lateral margin of the left ventricle and branch off with an obtuse angle. In most cases th\\ne Cx ends as an obtuse marginal branch, but 10% of patients have a left dominant circulation in which the Cx also supplies the posterior descending artery (PDA). Mnemonic: Marginal \\nbranches arise from the Cx and supply the lateral Margin of the left ventricle.\\nRight Coronary Artery (RCA):\\nRCA, LAD and LCx in Anterior projection The right coronary artery arises from the anterior sinus of Valsalva and courses through the right atrioventricular (AV) groove between the r\\night artium and right ventricle to the inferior part of the septum. In 50-60% the first branch of the RCA is the small conus branch, that supplies the right ventricle outflow tract.\\n In 20-30% the conus branch arises directly from the aorta. In 60% a sinus node artery arises as second branch of the RCA, that runs posteriorly to the SA-node (in 40% it originates\\n from the Cx). The next branches are some diagonals that run anteriorly to supply the anterior wall of the right ventricle. The large acute marginal branch (AM) comes off with an ac\\nute angle and runs along the  margin of the right ventricle above the diaphragm. The RCA continues in the AV groove posteriorly and gives off a branch to the AV node. In 65% of case\\ns the posterior descending artery (PDA) is a branch of the RCA (right dominant circulation). The PDA supplies the inferior wall of the left ventricle and inferior part of the septum\\n. LEFT: RCA comes off the right sinus of ValsalvaRIGHT: Conus artery comes off directly from the aorta On the image on the far left we see the most common situation, in which the RC\\nA comes off the right cusp and will provide the conus branch at a lower level (not shown). On the image next to it, we see a conus branch, that comes off directly from the aorta. Th\\ne large acute marginal branch (AM) supplies the lateral wall of the right ventricle. In this case there is a right dominant circulation, because the posterior descending artery (PDA\\n) comes off the RCA.\\nCoronary Anomalies:\\nCoronary anomalies are uncommon with a prevalence of 1%.

The illustration in the left upper corner is the most common and clinically significant anomaly. There is an anomalous origin of the LCA \\nfrom the right sinus of Valsalva and the LCA courses between the aorta and pulmonary artery.

US image made with a 1200 euro probe and tablet.\\nUS machines and probes:\\nIn this lean person, the normal terminal ileum and the normal, compressed appendix (arrow) are visualized on a tablet connected to a 1200 euro probe. For the average abdominal US pr\\nogram with patients of varying habitus, still three probes is the minimum. The cm’s indicate the range where image resolution is optimal. Since bowel lies close to the abdominal wal\\nl, the middle and small probe are the workhorses in US of the GI tract. Choice of the probe is based on the depth where the bowel is visualized during compression. For example, the \\nfluid-filled stomach in this obese patient (left), is best studied with the middle-transducer, the normal ileum and appendix in a thin patient (right), with the small transducer. Pr\\ne-sets for specific abdominal organs can be helpful, but we use only two abdominal pre-sets per probe: normal and XL for large and obese patients.\\nThe “over-processed” US image:\\nThe processed US image: speckle-noise-reduction Compare the native US images (left) of the pancreatic region with the strongly processed US images (right). In these over-processed i\\nmages the vessels have a sharper delineation with a completely anechoic lumen. However, also unrealistic reflections and contours are “created”. Note the unnatural bright reflection\\ns in the area dorsal from the pancreatic tail (right upper image) and note the bizarre contour of the stomach and the falciform ligament (right lower image).\\nUS examination of bowel:\\nUS of the GI tract has been quite unpopular in the past because of the interference of gas and other bowel contents (upper image). The good news is that pathological bowel usually i\\ns often conspicuous, due to local wall thickening and an empty lumen, e.g. in this patient with segmental Crohn’s colitis (lower image). Searching and screening for bowel pathology \\nis best done using the so-called  “mowing-the-lawn” technique. This technique requires graded compression, a high-frequency probe and not too viscous US gel. Like in mowing the lawn\\n, overlapping lanes are necessary, not to miss any pathology. Most commercially available US gels are quite viscous. It has several advantages to make it more fluent by adding about\\n one third of hot tap water. Better skin contact prevents disturbing air-artifacts (arrowheads). It is time-efficient to put the US gel on the patient, and not on the probe. With a \\nnormal habitus, one large dose ( ~25 cc) of  diluted US gel is sufficient for the entire examination. A small reservoir in the epigastric area may be used for “dipping”. In general,\\n liberal use of US gel has great advantages. \\nThere are however two drawbacks: things may get quite messy and hygiene may be endangered. This requires “US gel discipline” and a lot of towels or cleaning tissue. To avoid the cab\\nle getting sticky, you can put it around your neck or place it on the patient’s chest when studying the left flank. US gel should be removed from the probe, before putting the probe\\n back. Proper cleaning of the probes after each patient speaks for itself. Ask the manufacturer what to use as cleaning fluid. It is very important to keep the fingers of the probe-\\nhand free of US gel: the combination of rather forceful compression with subtle rotational movements requires a dry hand.\\nGraded compression:\\nAdvantages compression Compression should be graded and gentle Graded compression is remarkably well tolerated, even in peritonitis.

Dr. Pathria's specific areas of interest include musculoskeletal trauma, emergency radi\\nology, and musculoskeletal MR imaging. She is the author of the book MRI of the Musculoskeletal System. Normal muscle is symmetrical with smooth convex borders, linear branching and\\n feathery fat planes and low signal on all sequences When looking at muscle on MR there are a few rules to keep in mind: When looking at muscle pathology try to decide which one of \\nthe four basic patterns of abnormality is present: On the left an example of a lipoma creating a mass effect in the anterior compartment of the calf.\\nMuscle injury:\\nThe most common muscle injury is muscle strain (1). It is an injury to the musculotendinous junction. Typical for muscle strain is edema centered along the musculotendinous junction\\n (1). More severe muscle strains contain fluid collections such as hematomas and may contain grossly interrupted muscle fibers and thus may show masslike features on MR images in ad\\ndition to muscle edema. Muscle contusions are caused by a direct blow. MR images reveal interstitial hemorrhage as well as edema at the injured site . More severe contusions may con\\ntain hematomas and thus reveal a masslike lesion in addition to the edema.

In many muscles, the tendon extends deeply into the muscle creating a long musculo-tendinous junction (figure). This area i\\ns especially important in a trauma setting, because it is often involved. The epimysium is the fibrous tissue that lies at the edge of the muscle. It becomes the muscle sheath that \\nfuses with the tendon. This is also an important area to consider because when there is a tear in the muscle, fluid tends to leak out and collect in the epimysium. The pattern of ed\\nema in muscle strain will depend on the architecture and shape of the musculotendinous junction involved. The image on the left nicely demonstrates the feather-like arrangement of t\\nhe musculotendinous junction in an atrophic muscle. Complete tear of the rectus femoris with edema at the musculotendinous junction (arrows) The image on the left demonstrates edema\\n surrounding the musculotendinous junction in a feather-like arrangement. This is a complete tear to the rectus femoris (arrows). The architecture can be very confusing. For example\\n on the left the rectus femoris, which can show a variety of edema patterns depending on where (anatomically)\\nthe injury took place. The blue arrow demonstrates the tendon of the indirect head, which comes from the hip, it has a vertical orientation\\non this axial image. Along the posterior portion of the muscle (yellow arrows), there is a flat area of tendon originating from the knee. When a muscle has different orientations of\\n the tendons it means that there are different patterns of edema possible\\ndepending on the tendon injured. Therefore this is a pattern of edema corresponding to an injury arising from the knee. Muscle Strain (2) Muscle strain is an acute injury. The histo\\nry is usually very concise. The muscles that are most prone to strain are the long fusiform muscles that cross 2 articulations. Most at risk are the hamstrings, rectus femoris and m\\nedial gastrocnemius. Strain involving the upper extremity is slightly less common and then usually involves the biceps brachii. The hallmark of strain is a lot of edema around the m\\nyotendinous juntion because that is where the tearing takes place. There is edema around the tendon and sometimes the tendon itself will show signal changes. Myotendinous junction p\\nattern of muscle strain (left) and epimysial strain pattern (right) There are 2 patterns found with muscle strain. By far the most common is the myotendinous junction pattern, which\\n occurs roughly 97% of the time. Depending on the severity of the strain, there might also be fluid collections. The remaining 3% will show an epimysial strain pattern, with the abn\\normalities found at the periphery of the muscle. Epimysial strain pattern of an acute muscle strain of the supraspinatus muscle Muscle Strain (3) On the left an example of a weight-\\nlifter with an epimysial strain pattern. The tendon tears at the myotendinous junction, and the fluid leaks around the edge of the muscle showing an epimysial appearance. Do not con\\nfuse this with a degenerative or impingement-type tear. Strain of the subscapularis muscle On the left a strain with partial tear of the subscapularis. The subscapularis is a conver\\ngent muscle (like for example the pectoral muscle) with multiple tendons. Edema will have a multipennate distribution pattern, as the edema tracks in different directions along the \\nmultiple tendons. Two different types of musculotendinous junction strain On the far left a complete tear of the indirect head of the rectus femoris (yellow arrow). This tear origin\\nates in the hip. The image next to it, which was also shown above, shows a completely different finding. There is edema surrounding the distal tendon that is connected to the patell\\na. The other tendon is completely normal (blue arrow).\\nGrading muscle strain:\\nClinically the severity of a muscle injury is graded from 1-3. Trying to grade a muscle injury by the signal intensity is tricky. Chronic injuries can show mild signal changes and y\\net still be high grade injuries according to the clinical classification. On the left an example of a tear in the left pectoral muscle. On T1-weighted image there is a gap in the mu\\nscle with a small amount of fat filling it up. The gradient echo demonstrates focal fluid accumulation and some increased signal within the muscle. It does not look that severe. How\\never, when asked to fully contract the pectoral muscles there is an obvious asymmetry due to a complete tear in the muscle (blue arrow). This clinically is a grade 3 injury, with a \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 314}),\n",

There is normal muscle architecture on the T1-weighted image, and increased signal on T2-weighted image and STIR. The i\\nnjury will heal completely within a couple of weeks. This example shows edema with an epimysial pattern which is common around the flexor hallucis. When grading acute injuries, look\\n not only at the architecture but also at the length of the muscle. Studies have shown that the length of the muscle strain is the best predictor of the duration of disability, with\\n longer lesions requiring more time to recover. (Reference article by Dr. Connell DA et al, AJR 2004, 83: 975-984). So the longer the abnormality, the longer it takes for the injury\\n to heal. On the left a patient with 2 grades of injury to the gastrocnemius. There is a low grade injury to the lateral head.\\nModerate grade muscle strain:\\nOn the left the same patient. There is also a moderate grade injury to the medial head. Note the fluid accumulations around the muscle head. The more fluid, the higher the grade. Mo\\nderate grade injury to the rectus femoris muscle On the left an injured rectus femoris muscle. The images demonstrate a moderate grade injury, with architectural distortion and a fl\\nuid collection (arrow). Notice the edema at the bipennate musculotendinous junction.\\nHigh grade muscle strain:\\nOn the left an example of a high grade injury. There is a complete tear of the tendon or myotendinous junction of the pectoral muscle. This patient will lose all function in this mu\\nscle. On the left a complete tear of the left hamstring at the musculotendinous junction. Tthe tendons are avulsed and there is fluid accumulation. Complete hamstring rupture with a\\nn epimysial pattern of edema On the left a different patient with also a complete hamstring rupture. There is an epimysial pattern of edema and sciatic nerve irritation.\\nA hamstring syndrome may occur. This is a painful condition caused by post-traumatic scar formation around the sciatic nerve (arrow). Chronic changes after prior muscle strain\\nChronic changes of muscle strain:\\nOn the left images of a patient who had a prior muscle strain. There are typical chronic changes such as focal tendon thickening (blue arrow) and peritendinous muscle atrophy (yello\\nw arrow). On the left images of a patient who had an injury to the long head of the biceps femoris muscle. There are typical chronic changes such as focal tendon thickening (blue ar\\nrow) and severe muscle atrophy.\\nContusion:\\nMuscle contusion with edema of the skin, muscle and bone marrow (arrows) Muscle contusions are caused by a direct blow. The MR findings in contusion are similar to strain but withou\\nt the typical myotendinous junction localization seen in the latter. Typically, there is also skin edema and sometimes, bone contusion. MR images reveal edema at the injured site, f\\nrequently due to interstitial hemorrhage as well as edema. More severe contusions may contain hematomas and thus reveal a masslike lesion in addition to edema. It is mostly seen in \\nthe superficial muscles. Muscle contusion On the left images of a patient who has a mass-like swelling of the fore-foot. The findings are nonspecific, but the history 'Slammed car d\\noor on foot' was specific.\\nHemorrhage:\\nMuscle hematoma and parenchymal hemorrhage Hemorrhage can present as a discrete hematoma or as parenchymal hemorrhage. In the case on the left there is a mixed pattern. The signal i\\nntensity of a hematoma on T1W- and T2W-images depends on the stage of the hematoma (Table). Hyperacute hematoma On the left images of a patient who fell on a slippery floor. There i\\ns a hyperacute hematoma. Low signal intensity on T1W and high signal on T2W. Acute hematoma On the left an acute hematoma. It is isointense or hypointense to muscle on T1. The hypoi\\nntensity in T2WI in the acute period is due to the high concentration of intracellular deoxyhemoglobin. Early subacute hematoma On the left images of two different patients with an \\nearly subacute hematoma. On the far left a T1-weighted image. The hyperintensity at the periphery of the hematoma is due to methemoglobin which is seen after 2-7 days and can persis\\nt for months. The image on the right shows the same hyperintensity on a T2-weighted image. Late subacute hematoma: T1 (left) and T2 (right) On the left a late subacute hematoma with\\n layering. Chronic tennis leg On the left images of two different patients with a chronic hematoma in the calf. On the left a T1-weighted image. Notice the dark rim of hemosiderin s\\nurrounding the hematoma. On the right a T2-weighted image of a similar case. Notice that the hemosiderin is also dark on T2-weighted image. Morel-Lavallee lesion\\nMorel-Lavallee:\\nOn the left a chronic hematoma known as Morel-Lavallee lesion. A Morel-Lavallee lesion is the result of separation of the skin and subcutis from the fascia, producing a cavity that \\nis filled with fluid and debris. These lesions are found around the thigh and have a well-defined oval or fusiform shape. They are usually partially or wholly encapsulated Long-Stan\\nding Morel-Lavallee Lesions of the Trochanteric Region and Proximal Thigh: MRI Features in Five Patients by J. M.

When in doubt use gadolinium to see if the abnormality enhances. Continu\\ne with the post-Gad image. Metastasis of a renal cell carcinoma with central necrosis The majority of the lesion enhances, making hematoma unlikely. In the centre there is no enhanc\\nement as a result of necrosis. Hematomas can show some enhancement, but only at edge.\\nMyositis ossificans:\\nMyositis ossificans Severe blunt trauma causing an intra-muscular hematoma may result in delayed ossification in the soft tissues known as myositis ossificans. Myositis ossificans h\\nas a variable appearance depending on the maturity: Myositis ossificans On MRI myositis ossificans can be difficult to differentiate from osteosarcoma. On X-rays and CT soft tissue \\nossification not attached to bone is seen. Myositis ossificans On the left another case of myositis ossificans with bone formation.\\nCompartment syndrome:\\nPost fasciotomy for post fracture compartment syndrome Compartment syndrome is a limb-threatening and life-threatening condition observed when perfusion pressure falls below tissue \\npressure in a closed anatomic space. A fasciotomy procedure with incision in the skin and the muscle fascia is necessary to release the pressure and regain normal function of the ca\\npillaries. Compartment syndrome progresses to rhabdomyolysis if untreated. Necrosis of tissue may begin at interstitial pressure as low as 30 mm Compartment Syndrome in Wheeless' Te\\nxtbook of Orthopaedics Muscle necrosis, post IV gadolinium In the lower leg there are four compartments: the anterior, deep and superficial posterior compartment and a small lateral\\n compartment. On the left T1W-images of a patient one month post trauma. On the post-Gadolinium image the necrosis in the anterior and lateral compartment is seen. The posterior com\\npartment is normal. Chronic lateral compartment syndrome On the left a T2W-image of a patient with a chronic lateral compartment syndrome. Rhabdomyolysis as a result of compartment \\nsyndrome On the left a compartment syndrome in the upper leg which progressed to rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is a dissolution of skeletal muscles that causes extravasation of tox\\nic intracellular contents from the myocytes into the circulatory system and can lead to kidney failure. Calcific myonecrosis\\nCalcific myonecrosis:\\nCalcific myonecrosis is a rare post- traumatic entity characterized by latent formation of a dystrophic calcified mass occurring almost exclusively in the lower limb. In calcific my\\nonecrosis an entire single muscle is replaced by a fusiform mass with central liquefaction and peripheral calcification. They can present as enlarging soft tissue masses with clinic\\nal features that suggest an enlarging soft-tissue neoplasm or infection.

The man was caught by his wife while cheating on he\\nr with another woman and he was rewarded with a stab into the groin. This resulted in a laceration of his right pectineus muscle. MR imaging is usually not required for laceration, \\nsince these patients usually go directly to the ER or OR for surgical exploration, but this case nicely demonstrates the atrophied muscle and the scar tissue.\\nDelayed onset muscle soreness:\\nDelayed onset muscle soreness of gasctrocnemius Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) develops 1-2 days following exercise and resolves in 1-2 weeks (for example after the first days\\n on the ski slopes). DOMS is a type of overuse injury that does not become symptomatic until hours or days after the overuse episode, in contrast with a muscle strain or contusion, \\nwhich usually is immediately painful. The MR findings show diffuse muscle edema that does not localize to the myotendinous junction and can persist for weeks. On the left a patient \\nwho had gone for a run for the first time in quite a while. The muscle is irritated as illustrated by edema in the gastrocnemius (arrows). Because there is a delay in symptoms, pati\\nents are not always aware of when or how the injury was actually caused. On the left a navy recruit with delayed onset muscle soreness after weight-lifting. Note the swollen edemato\\nus brachialis muscle. These abnormalities can last for weeks.\\nFascial hernia:\\nA fascial tear presents as a mass, the signal is usually normal (rather like an accessory muscle). The muscle herniates through the fascial defect, protruding upon muscle contractio\\nn. It is an intermittent mass and can be missed on MR if it is only visible during contraction. A fascial tear is a typical sports injury and most commonly involves the calf (figure\\n). This type of muscle injury is well evaluated with ultrasound, because it is an dynamic examination. David A.

It is iss\\nued by the IASLC (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) and replaces the TNM 7th edition.\\nTNM-8:\\nTNM-staging 8th edition. Changes to 7th edition in red. The 8th edition of the TNM classification for non-small lung cancer is shown in the table. Conform previous editions there ar\\ne three components that describe the anatomic extent of the tumor: T for the extent of the primary tumor, N for lymph node involvement, and M for metastatic disease. T-classificatio\\nn is performed using CT, the N- and M-classification using CT and PET-CT. It can be used in the pre-operative imaging and clinical classification iTNM/cTNM, but it is also applicabl\\ne for definitive pathological staging pTNM, re-staging after therapy yTNM and staging of a recurrence rTNM. Differences with the 7th edition are presented in red.\\nWhat is new in the TNM 8th edition:\\nIn the new TNM 8th edition the size went down for several T-categories, and some new pathology based categories were introduced. Also, new M-categories were introduced regarding ext\\nrathoracic metastatic disease. Size of a solid lesion is defined as maximum diameter in any of the three orthogonal planes in lung window. In subsolid lesions T-classification is de\\nfined by the diameter of the solid component and not the diameter of the complete groundglass lesion. Stages of lung cancer adapted from the 8th Edition of TNM in Lung Cancer\\nNon-small lung cancer stages:\\nSubsets of T, N and M categories are grouped into certain stages, because these patients share similar prognosis [1]. For example cT1N0 disease (stage IA) has a 5-year survival of 7\\n7-92%. On the other end of the spectrum is any M1c disease (stage IVB) that has a 5-year survival of 0%. Lungcancer with evident transfissural growth on both the coronal and sagitta\\nl reconstructions; lobectomy is no longer possible. Lobectomy is generally not possible if there is: These are specific items to report. Thin-slice images and three-plane reconstruc\\ntions are necessary to best demonstrate the relation with surrounding structures.

Supraclavicular nodes Superior mediastinal nodes Inferior Mediastinal nodes Aortic nodes Subcar\\ninal nodes Inferior Mediastinal nodes Pulmonary nodes The boundary between level 10 and level 4 is on the right the lower border of the azygos vein and on the left the upper border \\nof the pulmonary artery (N1 vs. N2). There is an important separation to be made between level 1 and level 2/3 nodes, because it is N3-stage versus N2. The lower border of level 1 i\\ns the clavicles bilaterally and, in the midline, the upper border of the manubrium. The boundary between level 4R and 4L is the left lateral border of the trachea, and not the anato\\nmic midline. Paracardial, internal mammarian, diaphragmatic, axillary and intercostal lymph nodes are not described in the IALSC lymph node map. Occasionally these can be present. I\\nt is proposed to regard these non-regional nodes as metastastic disease [2]. CT is unrealiable in staging lymph nodes in patients with NSCLC regardless of the threshold size that is\\n chosen. PET-CT is much more reliable in determining the N-status. False-positives occur in patients with sarcoid, tuberculosis and other infections. Because of the high negative pr\\nedictive value, PET scanning should be performed in all patients considered for surgery.

N1 alters the prognosis but not the management. N2-disease – Right sided tumor with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes\\nN2 - Nodes:\\nN2-nodes represent ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymphadenopathy. There is only a subset of patients with N2 disease that benefits from resection. Those are the patients who\\n -after a negative mediastinoscopy- are found to have microscopic metastatic disease at the time of thoracotomy. These patients have a better prognosis than those with evident N2-di\\nsease. N3-stage disease.\\nN3 - Nodes:\\nN3-nodes represent contralateral mediastinal or contralateral hilar lymphadenopathy or any scalene or supraclavicular nodes. These are irresectable.

However, beyond the pulmonary domain, chest CT also provides\\nvaluable insights into the cardiovascular system, although it is frequently\\nbeyond the scope of imaging indication. Due to the wealth of information on non-cardiac chest CT\\nscans, there is a risk of oversight for those not specifically trained in or\\nfocused on cardiovascular\\nradiology.

Azygos continuation of the inferior caval vein is normally an inc\\nidental finding in asymptomatic patients, although it might be associated with other cardiovascular abnormalities, as well as with splenic absence or polysplenia.\\nThe importance of not overlooking this condition lies mainly in its relevance for surgical planning as well as endovascular procedures, as it prevents catheterizing the right heart \\nfrom inferior.

For a vessel in this location, lateral to the\\naortic arch, there is a differential diagnosis of four:\\nLevo-atrial cardinal vein:\\nA rare vascular anomaly that some consider a left-sided\\nSVC connecting to the left atrium is the levo-atrial cardinal vein (LACV).\\nHowever, one may argue its behavior is more on the anomalous pulmonary venous return spectrum. Although\\nin levo-atrial cardinal vein, the pulmonary veins drain normally into the left atrium, there\\nis an anomalous venous connection between the left atrium and\\nleft brachiocephalic vein, creating a left-to-right shunt. Due to its location a levo-atrial cardinal vein may easily be misinterpreted for\\na left-sided superior caval vein, however,\\na left SVC should connect to the coronary\\nsinus and right atrium and just\\nrepresents a venous variant and not a cardiovascular shunt. Simply check the drainage site to differentiate these two.\\nLeft superior intercostal vein - Aortic nipple:\\nA mimicker of a\\nvascular variant lateral to the aortic arch is the left superior\\nintercostal vein. This is a normal venous structure considered part of the hemi-azygos system, and is sometimes more prominent than in others depending on collateral flow. \\nDue to\\nits location it may suggest an anomalous pulmonary venous return, left-sided SVC or levo-atrial cardinal vein, however, assessment of the origin and course of the vascular structure\\n will help separate this\\nnormal venous structure from the above mentioned differential diagnoses of vascular\\nanomalies.

It is recommended to visually quantify aortic valve calcification as mild, moderate and\\nsevere (figure). A recommendation can be included in the radiology report (see Figure). If aortic valve calcification is identified, study the dimensions of the aortic root and asce\\nnding aorta.

The assessment of the elbow can be difficult because of the changing anatomy of the growing ske\\nleton and the subtility of some of these fractures. In this review important signs of fractures and dislocations of the elbow will be discussed. Before reading this article you can \\ntry one of the cases in the menubar.

Scroll through the images on the left to see how hyperextens\\nion leads to a supracondylar fracture. The hemarthros will result in a displacement of the anterior fat pad upwards and the posterior fat backwards. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images.\\nExtreme valgus:\\nThe other important fracture mechanism is extreme valgus of the elbow. The normal elbow already has a valgus positioning. When a child falls on the outstrechted arm, this can lead t\\no extreme valgus. On the lateral side this can result in a dislocation or a fracture of the radius with or without involvement of the olecranon. When the forces have more effect on \\nthe humerus, the extreme valgus will result in a fracture of the lateral condyle. On the medial side the valgus force can lead to avulsion of the medial epicondyle. Sometimes the me\\ndial epicondyl becomes trapped within the joint. Because of the valgus position of the normal elbow an avulsion of the lateral epicondyle will be uncommon.\\nRadiological Interpretation:\\nMethodical review:\\nWhen looking at radiographs of the elbow after trauma a methodical review of the radiographs is needed . You should ask yourself the following important questions. Is there a sign o\\nf joint effusion? After trauma this almost always indicates the presence of hemarthros due to a fracture (either visible or occult). Is there a normal alignment between the bones? I\\nn children dislocations are frequent and can be very subtle. Are the ossification centres normal? Is the piece of bone that you're looking at a normal ossification centre and is thi\\ns ossification centre in the normal position. . Look especially for the position of the radial epiphysis and the medial epicondyle (figure). Is there a subtle fracture? Some of the \\nfractures in children are very subtle. \\nSo you need to be familiar with the typical picture of these fractures. . Normal anterior fat pad.\\nFat Pad Sign and Joint effusion:\\nNormally on a lateral view of the elbow flexed in 90? a fat pad is seen on the anterior aspect of the joint . This is normal fat located in the joint capsule. On the posterior side \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 325}),\n",

Positive fat pad sign Disten\\ntion of the joint will cause the anterior fat pad to become elevated and the posterior fat pad to become visible. An elevated anterior lucency or a visible posterior lucency on a tr\\nue lateral radiograph of an elbow flexed at 90? is described as a positive fat pad sign (figure). Hemarthros results in an upward displacement of the anterior fat pad and a backward\\n displacement the posterior fat. Positive Anterior Fat Pad sign. On digital radiographs you may need to adjust the window width and level to appreciate this. No fracture was visible\\n on the X-rays. Positive fat pad sign (2)\\nAny elbow joint distention either hemorrhagic, inflammatory or traumatic gives rise to a positive fat pad sign. If a positive fat pad sign is not present in a child, significant int\\nra-articular injury is unlikely. A visible fat pad sign without the demonstration of a fracture should be regarded as an occult fracture. These patients are treated as having a nond\\nisplaced fracture with 2 weeks splinting. Skaggs et al repeated x-rays after three weeks in patients with a positive posterior fat pad sign but no visible fracture. They found evide\\nnce of fracture in 75%. They concluded that in trauma displacement of the posterior fat pad is virtually pathognomonic of the presence of a fracture. Displacement of the anterior fa\\nt pad alone however can occur due to minimal joint effusion and is less specific for fracture. Notice that the elbow is not positioned well. Try to find out what went wrong in the c\\nhapter on positioning.\\nAlignment:\\nThere are two important lines which help in the diagnosis of dislocation and fracture . These are the Radiocapitellar line and the Anterior humeral line. Radiocapitellar line\\nA line drawn through the centre of the radial neck should pass throught the centre of the capitellum, whatever the positioning of the patient, since the radius articulates with the \\ncapitellum (figure). In dislocation of the radius this line will not pass through the centre of the capitellum. On the left we see, that the radiocapitellar line goes through centre\\n of the capitellum on every radiogragh even though C and D are not well positioned. Notice supracondylar fracture in B. On the left more examples of the radiocapitellar line. The ri\\nght lower image shows an obvious dislocation of the radius. Radiographs of elbows at different ages. The Anterior Humeral line goes through the middle third of the capitellum . Ante\\nrior humeral line. A line drawn on a lateral view along the anterior surface of the humerus should pass through the middle third of the capitellum.. This line is called the Anterior\\n Humeral line . In cases of a supracondylar fracture the anterior humeral line usually passes through the anterior third\\nof the capitellum or in front of the capitellum due to posterior bending of the distal humeral fragment. On the left the anterior humeral line passes through the anterior third of t\\nhe capitellum. This indicates that the condyles are displaced dorsally (i.e. supracondylar fracture). First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The radiocapitellar \\nline ends above the capitellum. This means that the radius is dislocated. Did you also notice the olecranon fracture? Whenever the radius is fractured or dislocated, always study th\\ne ulna carefully. The order of appearance of the ossification centres is specified in the mnemonic C-R-I-T-O-E.\\nOssification centres:\\nThere are 6 ossification centres around the elbow joint.\\n They appear and fuse to the adjacent bones at different ages. It is important to know the sequence of appearance since the ossification centers always appear in a strict order. Thi\\ns order of appearance is specified in the mnemonic C-R-I-T-O-E\\n(Capitellum - Radius - Internal or medial epicondyle - Trochlea - Olecranon - External or lateral epicondyle). The ages at which these ossification centres appear are highly variabl\\ne and differ between individuals. It is not important to know these ages, but as a general guide you could remember 1-3-5-7-9-11 years. Fragmented appearance of the Trochlea in 2 di\\nfferent children. The Trochlea has two or more ossification centres which can give the trochlea a fragmented appearance. Trochlea ossification-fragments simulate loose bodies in the\\n joint On a lateral view the trochlea ossifications may project into the joint. They should not be mistaken for loose intra-articular bodies (arrow).\\nRadiography:\\nShoulder higher than elbow. Radius and Capitellum project on to the ulna.\\nCommon errors in positioning:\\nError 1: Shoulder higher than elbow For a true lateral view the shoulder should be at the level of the elbow. If the shoulder is higher than the elbow, the radius and capitellum wil\\nl project on the ulna. The solution is either to lift the examination table which will lift the elbow or to lower the shoulder by placing the patient on a smaller chair. LEFT: Sligh\\nt endorotation of the humerus due to a low position of the wrist. RIGHT: More endorotation due to malpositioning. Error 2: Wrist lower than elbow On the left two examples of a 'low \\nwrist positioning' leading to rotation of the humerus. The low position of the wrist leads to endorotation of the humerus. The lateral structures like the capitellum and the radius \\nwill move anteriorly, while a medial structure like the medial epicondyle will move posteriorly. The wrist should be higher than the elbow to compensate for the normal valgus positi\\non of the elbow. The hand should be with the 'thumb up'.\\nElbow fractures:\\nSupracondylar fractures:\\nThese fractures account for more than 60% of all elbow fractures in children (see Table). More than 95% of supracondylar fractures are hyperextension type due to a fall on the outst\\nretched hand. \\nThe elbow becomes locked in hyperextension. \\nThe olecranon is pushed into the olecranon fossa causing the anterior humeral cortex to bend and eventually break. \\nIf the force continues both the anterior and posterior cortex will fracture. Supracondylar fractures. In A the anterior humeral line passes through the anterior third of the capitel\\nlum and in B even more anteriorly. Notice positive posterior fat pad sign in both cases Supracondylar fractures (2)\\nIf there is only minimal or no displacement these fractures can be occult on radiographs. \\nThe only sign will be a positive fat pad sign. \\nUsually there is some displacement and the anterior humeral line will not pass through the centre of the capitellum but through the anterior third or even anterior to the capitellum\\n (figure). Supracondylar fractures (3)\\nSupracondylar fractures are classified according to Gartland.\\nGartland Type I fractures are often difficult to see on X-rays since there is only minimal displacement. \\nMost of these fractures consist of greenstick or torus fractures. The only clue to the diagnosis may be a positive fat pad sign. \\nThese patients are treated with casting. In Gartland type II fractures there is displacement but the posterior cortex is intact. \\nThere may be some rotation. These fractures require closed reduction and some need percutaneous fixation if a long-arm cast does not adequately hold the reduction. Gartland type III\\n fracture Gartland type III fractures are completely dislocated and are at risk for malunion and neurovascular complications (figure). They require reduction by closed or if necessa\\nry open means. Stabilisation is maintained with either two lateral pins or medial lateral cross pin technique.

Supracondylar fractures (4)\\nMalunion will result in the classic 'gunstock' deformity due to rotation or inadequate correction of medial collaps. Posterolateral displacement of the distal fragment can be associ\\nated with injurie to the neurovascular bundle which is displaced over the medial metaphyseal spike. Nerve injurie almost always results in neuropraxis that resolves in 3-4 months. V\\nascular injurie usually results in a pulseless but pink hand. \\nConservative management and vascular intervention have the same outcome. \\nA pulseless and white hand after reduction needs exploration. Flexion-type supracondylar fracture caused by direkt impact Supracondylar fractures (5) Flexion-type fractures are unco\\nmmon (5% of all supracondylar fractures). \\nThey are caused by direct impact on the flexed elbow.\\n Ulnar nerve injury is more common. \\nCompared to extension types, they are more likely to be unstable, so more likely to require fixation.\\nLateral Condyle fractures:\\nThis fracture is the second most common distal humerus fracture in children. They occur between the ages of 4 and 10 years. These fractures occur when a varus force is applied to th\\ne extended elbow. They tend to be unstable and become displaced because of the pull of the forearm extensors. Since these fractures are intra-articular they are prone to nonunion be\\ncause the fracture is bathed in synovial fluid. Lateral condyle fractures are classified according to Milch. They are Salter-Harris IV epiphysiolysis fractures. Most are Milch II fr\\nactures that travel from the lateral humeral metaphysis above the epiphysis and exit through the lateral crista of the trochlea leading to an unstable humeral ulnar articulation. La\\nteral Condyle fractures (2) The problem with the Milch-classification is the fact that the fracture fragments are primarily cartilaginous. The fracture line through the cartilage is\\n not visible on radiographs, so the radiographic interpretation concerning classification is difficult.\\nTreatment strategies are therefore based on the amount of displacement (see Table). Undisplaced fractures are treated with a long arm cast.\\nThese fractures must be carefully monitored as they have a tendency to displace. At follow up both AP and Oblique views are taken after removal of the cast. \\nOnce displaced fractures consolidate in a malunited position, treatment is difficult and fraught with complications.\\nFor this reason surgical reductions is recommended within the first 48 hours. Open reduction is indicated for all displaced fractures and those demonstrating joint instability. Late\\nral Condyle fractures (3) .\\nThe diagnosis of a lateral condyle fracture can be challenging. Fracture lines are sometimes barely visible (figure). Remembering the fact that the lateral condyle fracture is the s\\necond most common elbow-fracture in children and because you know where to look for will help you Lateral condyle fracture. On the x-ray only a small metaphyseal fragment is visible\\n. The detatched fragment however is larger than it appears on the radiograph. The fracture extents into the lateral ridge of the trochlea. Elbow is probably unstable. Lateral Condyl\\ne fractures (4) . Since most of the structures involved are cartilageneous, it is very difficult to know the exact extent of the fracture. CT reconstruction of displaced lateral con\\ndyle fracture. Humeroulnar joint is stable. Sometimes the fracture runs through the ossified part of the capitellum. In those cases it is easy. The case on the left shows a lateral \\ncondyle fracture extending through the ossified part of the capitellum. This is a Milch I fracture. The elbow is stable. \\nThere is too much displacement so osteosynthesis has to be performed. MR of lateral condyle fracture. Milch II and unstable elbow.

(Courtesy of Lynne Steinbach, M.D. Univ. of California, San Francisco) MRI can be helpfull in depicting the ful\\nl extent of the cartilaginous component of the fracture. The case on the left shows a fracture extending into the unossified trochlear ridge. The fracture through the trochlear cart\\nilage is so far medial that the ulna is only supported on the medial side. This means that the elbowjoint is unstable.

Blue arrow indicates a cleft epiphysis of the radius (normal variant) Lateral Cond\\nyle fractures (5) \\nIn lateral condyle fractures the actual fracture line can be very subtle since the metaphyseal flake of bone may be minor. The fracture fragment is often rotated. An oblique view ca\\nn be helpfull, but usually these are not routinely performed (figure). Two cases of overprojection of the capitellum on humeral epiphysis simulating a fracture. Notice olecranon fra\\ncture on the right Lateral Condyle fractures (6) . Overprojection of the capitellum on the humeral metaphysis may simulate a lateral condyle fracture (figure). Lateral Condyle fract\\nures (7) . On the left a couple of examples of lateral condyle fractures. Capitellum fracture While fractures of the lateral condyle occur in children between the age of 4 -10 years\\n, isolated fractures of the capitellum are seen in children above the age of 12. Capitellum fractures are uncommon. The rotation of the fracture fragment gives a typical appearance \\non the X-rays (arrow). Normal medial epicondyle projecting posteriorly. Notice radial head dislocation and olecranon fracture\\nMedial Epicondyle avulsion:\\nThe medial epicondyle is an apophysis since it does not contribute to the longitudinal growth of the humerus. \\nIt is located on the dorsal side of the elbow. On a lateral view especially if the arm is endorotated it can project so far posteriorly that one could suggest an avulsion (figure). \\nHowever avulsions are located more distally and anteriorly. Since the medial epicondyle is an extra-articular structure a fracture or avulsion will not automatically produce a posit\\nive fat pad sign. Avulsion of medial epicondyle. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (2). 80% of avulsion fractures occur in boys with a peak age in early adolescence. The mechanism is an ac\\nute valgus stress due to a fall on the outstretched hand or sometimes due to armwrestling. Chronic injuries do occur in young athletes (little league elbow). The mechanism that caus\\nes these stressfractures on the medial side is the same mechanism that causes a osteochondritis of the capitellum due to impaction on the lateral side. Dislocation of the elbow with\\n interposed medial epicondyle. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (3). There is a 50% incidence of associated elbow dislocations. \\nWhen the elbow is dislocated and the medial epicondyle is avulsed,\\n it may become interposed between the articular surface of the humerus and the olecranon (figure). In every dislocation the first question should be 'where is the medial epicondyle'\\n. Same case as above. After reduction the epicondyle returned to its normal position (not good visible due to cast) and was fixated with K-wires. On reducing the elbow the fragment \\nmay return to it's original position or remain trapped in the joint. \\nThis may severely damage the articular surface. So post-reduction films should be studied carefully. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (4). Due to the extreme valgus force the joint may te\\nmporarily open. \\nThe avulsed fragment may become entrapped in the joint even when there is no dislocation of the elbow. On AP-view the avulsed medial epicondyle projects over the trochlea. Lateral v\\niew shows the fragment to be trapped within the joint. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (5).\\nAn avulsed fragment that is located within the joint can give diagnostic problems. On an AP-view this fragment may be overlooked (figure). When the trochlea is not yet ossified the \\navulsed fragment may simulate a trochlear ossification centre. Another example of a dislocated elbow with avulsion of the medial epicondyle. In this case the epicondyle is not retra\\ncted into the joint. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (6).

Subtle radial neck fracture seen only on AP-view.\\nProximal fractures of the Radius:\\nIn adults fractures usually involve the articular surface of the radial head.\\n In children however it's the radial neck that fractures because the metaphyseal bone is weak due to constant remodelling. \\nUsually it is a Salter Harris II fracture. If there is no displacement it can be difficult to make the diagnosis (figure). Radial neck fracture with tilt. Notice trochlear ossificat\\nions projecting in between humerus and ulna simulating intra-articular fragments. If there is less than 30? tilt of the radial head patients are treated with a collar. \\nIt is important to realize that there is normally some angulation of the radial head ( up to 15?). If there is more than 30? tilt closed reduction is performed. After closed reducti\\non radiograph in cast shows unsuccesfull reduction. K-wire insertion is performed Whenever closed reduction is unsuccesfull in restoring tilt or when it is not possible to pronate a\\nnd supinate up to 60?, a K-wire is inserted to maintain reduction. The radial epiphysis is slipped (arrows). The radiocapitellar line does not pass through the capitellum indicating\\n dislocation and there is a fracture of the olecranon Radial neck fractures aswell as radial head dislocations are in 50% of the cases associated with other elbow injuries. \\nThe most common is a fracture of the olecranon. When the radial epiphysis is yet very small a slipped radial epiphysis may be overlooked (figure). Same patient as above 4 weeks late\\nr If these fractures are not recognized or reduction is unsuccesfull radial head overgrowth can be the result. A short radius may also be the result since the epiphysis of the radiu\\ns contributes to the length growth of the radius. LEFT: an obvious radial dislocation.

Radius Pulled Elbow (Nursemaid's elbow) In children When the forearm is pulled the radial head moves dista\\nlly and the ligament slips over the radial head and becomes trapped within the joint.

The radiologist must possess an understanding of t\\nhe factors that alter clinical decision making and patient treatment. In this review we will discuss: Complications Imaging\\nImaging:\\nPA view: wrist and elbow at shoulder heightLateral view: shoulder, elbow and wrist in sagittal plane\\nPositioning:\\nPA view should be taken with the wrist and elbow at shoulder height. This means that the wrist, elbow and shoulder are all in the transverse plane, perpendicular to the x-ray beam. \\nOnly in this position, the radius and the ulna are parallel. Lowering the arm makes the radius cross the ulna and become relatively shorter resulting in improper measurement of the \\nlength of the radius. Lateral view is taken with the elbow adducted to the side. Shoulder, elbow and wrist are again in one plane, i.e. the sagittal plane. This positioning will mak\\ne the lateral view exactly perpendicular to the PA view. On a correctly positioned PA view the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon groove (arrow) can be seen. The extensor carpi ulnaris t\\nendon groove should be at the level of or radial to the base of the ulnar styloid. True lateral: The palmar cortex of pisiform (red arrow) lies between the palmar cortex of scaphoid\\n and capitate. A true lateral view is defined by the relationship between the pisiforme, capitate and scaphoid bones. On a standard lateral view, the palmar cortex of the pisiform b\\none should overlie the central third of the interval between the palmar cortices of the distal scaphoid pole and the capitate head. Apparent volar tilt of the surface of the distal \\nradius, as measured on the lateral view, increases with supination and decreases with pronation of the wrist (5). A change of 10 degrees rotation between two consecutive control lat\\neral radiographs is not uncommon during clinical follow-up and results in 5 degrees change in apparent tilt. CT should be performed if conventional radiographs provide insufficient \\ndetail about radiocarpal articular step-off and gap displacement. On the left a patient with a communitive intraarticular fracture of the distal radius with displacement of the vola\\nr rim of the radius together with the carpus (i.e. a volar Barton's).

Scroll through the images and notice how well CT demonstrates the fracture components and the displacemen\\nt. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is of benefit when concomitant injuries of ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are suspected or if a fracture is suspected but \\nnot demonstrated on routine radiographs. On the left a fracture of the ulnar styloid process not visible on standard radiography, but clearly demonstrated with MR.\\nMeasurements:\\nRadial length or height Radial length is measured on the PA radiograph as the distance between one line perpendicular to the long axis of the radius passing through the distal tip o\\nf the radial styloid. A second line intersects distal articular surface of ulnar head. This measurement averages 10-13 mm. Radial inclination or angle Radial inclination represents \\nthe angle between one line connecting the radial styloid tip and the ulnar aspect of the distal radius and a second line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius. The ra\\ndial inclination ranges between 21 and 25 degrees . Loss of radial inclination will increase the load across the lunate. Radial tilt Radial tilt is measured on a lateral radiograph.\\n The radial tilt represents the angle between a line along the distal radial articular surface and the line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius at the joint margin.\\n The normal volar tilt averages 11 degrees and has a range of 2-20 degrees .\\nRadiological Interpretation:\\nTable 1: Description of fracture characteristics There are many ways to describe distal radial fractures and there are several classification systems. In clinical practice however f\\nrequently eponyms like Colles' and Barton's are used. When these epomyms are used, an accurate description of the fracture characteristics should always be included in the report(5)\\n. In addition it should also be noted if there is osteoporosis or additional findings such as ligamentous injuries. We will discuss the following:\\nLocation:\\nOne of the most important characteristics is whether a fracture is extraarticular or intraarticular. Extraarticular fractures are usually less complicated, unless they are comminuti\\nve. Intraarticular fractures either involve the radiocarpal joint, distal radioulnar joint, or both. Extraarticular fracture with volar bending (Smith' farcture)\\nConfiguration:\\nAlways mention whether the fracture is transverse (good prognosis), oblique or comminuted (multifragmented). When a fracture is oblique or when it is comminuted with crossing of the\\n mid axial line, it can be unstable. On the left a patient with an extraarticular distal radius fracture. Notice the oblique course on the lateral view. Fractures with this configur\\nation frequently show loss of reduction at follow up and need surgical treatment. On the left a sagittal reconstruction of an oblique intraarticular fracture of the distal radius. T\\nhis is a volar Barton's type fracture. Even in a cast the volar fragment will show progressive displacement at follow-up and a volar buttress plate is needed to hold the volar rim i\\nn place.\\nDisplacement:\\nFractures are either displaced or nondisplaced. A fracture with an offset of 2 mm or more in any plane or 2 mm offset involving the articular surface is considered displaced. Displa\\ncement can be dorsal, volar, radial or proximal. Axial shortening, radial inclination and radio-ulnar displacement can be measured on the routine posterior/anterior film. Dorsal til\\nt and dorsal or palmar displacement can be measured on the routine lateral X-ray. Fragment displacement and rotation may be further determined using CT.\\nInstability:\\nInstability is defined as a high risk of secondary displacement after initial adequate reduction. Radiographic signs that favor instability are displacement and an oblique or commin\\nuted configuration (as mentioned above). These signs are listed in the table on the left. Although the initial x-ray after reduction may look good, always look for loss of reduction\\n at follow up. Articular incongruity is the most important factor in the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis of the wrist. Avulsion of the tip or stable fractures of the uln\\nar neck\\nUlna and Distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ):\\nAssessment of a wrist fracture must also include a description of the distal ulna and distal radioulnar joint (9). The distal ulna articulates with the sigmoid notch of the radius. \\nType I: stable Avulsion fractures of the tip of the ulnar styloid and stable fractures of the ulnar neck have a good prognosis. Following reduction of the radius the DRUJ is congrue\\nnt and stable. Extraarticular unstable fractures however, require plate fixation. Tear of the TFCC or avulsion of the base of the ulnar styloid Type II: unstable There is subluxatio\\nn or dislocation of the ulnar head as a result of avulsion of the base of the ulnar styloid or tear of the TFCC and/or capsular ligaments. The subluxation has to be reduced with clo\\nsed or operative treatment to avoid chronic instability and arthosis.

Colles fractures are seen more \\nfrequently with advancing age and in women with osteoporosis. In many cases a Colles' fracture is an extraarticular, uncomplicated and stable fracture, but it can be intraarticular.\\n So look for signs of instability in all Colles' fractures, especially: On the left a detailed AP view of the same patient as above. In addition to the dorsal angulation seen on the\\n lateral view, notice the following: Just calling this fracture a Colles' fracture would be insufficient. All the characteristics have to be mentioned in the radiology report to con\\nvey the full extent of the injury, possible complications and treatment.\\nSmith's fracture:\\nSmith's fractures occur in younger patients and are the result of high energy trauma on the volar flexed wrist. Volar comminution and intraarticular extension are more common. On th\\ne left an extraarticular Smith's fracture with palmar and radial angulation and displacement. There is also an avulsion of the ulnar styloid process.\\nBarton's fracture:\\nVolar-type Barton's is a fracture-dislocation of the volar rim of the radius. This type is the most common. Dorsal-type Barton's is a fracture-dislocation of the dorsal rim of the r\\nadius. Dislocation of the radiocarpal joint is the hallmark of Barton's fractures. These are shear type fractures of the distal articular surface of the radius with translation of t\\nhe distal radial fragment and the carpus. These fractures have a great tendency for redislocation and malunion. They usually require operative treatment. On the left a volar-type Ba\\nrton's fracture. The radiographic findings are the following: On the left a dorsal-type Barton's fracture. The radiographic findings are the following:\\nDie-punch fracture:\\nA die-punch fracture is a depression fracture of the lunate fossa of the distal radius. It is the result of a transverse load through the lunate. The radiographic findings can be ve\\nry subtle. In many cases there is also a subtle proximal displacement of lunate, seen as a break in carpal arc I. (see the article Wrist - Carpal instability). Die punch fracture On\\n the left a typical die-punch fracture. The blue arrow indicates the depressed fragment of the lunate fossa. Notice the articular step-off.

On the left two 3D-reconstructions of the same fractu\\nre as above.\\nChauffeur's fracture:\\nAn isolated fracture of the radial styloid process is also called a Hutchinson's or chauffeur's fracture. Displacement of the fragment is uncommon. There can be associated injury to\\n the scapholunate ligament. In most cases a fracture of the radial styloid process is part of a comminutive intraarticular fracture. Ulnar styloid process fracture An ulnar styloid \\nprocess fracture is usually associated with radial fractures and rarely isolated. An isolated fracture of the tip is clinically insignificant. Displaced fractures of the base are us\\nually associated with TFC tears and can be associated with instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). On the left a subtle fracture of the tip of the ulnar styloid process (\\nblue arrow) in a patient with a volar Barton's fracture. Notice the depression of the volar rim.\\nFractures in Children:\\nTorus fracture:\\nTorus fractures, or buckle fractures, are extremely common injuries in children. Because children have softer bones, one side of the bone may buckle. The word torus is derived from \\nthe Latin word 'Tori' meaning swelling or protuberance. These injuries tend to heal much more quickly than the similar greenstick fractures.\\nGreen stick fracture:\\nThese are partial fractures, since only one part of the bone is broken and the other side is bent. The name is derived from an analogy of breaking a young, fresh tree branch. Most o\\nften the greenstick fracture must be bent back into the proper position. Greenstick fractures can take a long time to heal because they tend to occur in the middle, more slowly grow\\ning parts of bone.\\nEpiphysiolysis fracture:\\nThese are usually Salter Harris type II epiphysiolysis fractures. Restorage of the anatomical situation is necessary to prevent growth disturbances. Redislocation is common after cl\\nosed reduction. In many cases they need percutaneous pinning.\\nClassification systems:\\nMuller AO-classification:\\nThe Muller AO-classification is adapted by the Orthopaedic Trauma Association. In reference (6) a link is provided to download the illustrations of the Muller AO Classification of F\\nractures. A = extra-articular fracture B = partial articular fracture C = complete articular fracture of radius\\nFernandez Classification:\\nThis classification is popular, since it addresses the mechanism of injury and the consequent treatment options. Instability is defined as a high risk of secondary displacement afte\\nr initial adequate reduction. Associated traumatic lesions are ligamentous rupture, nerve compression and compartment syndrome. Type 1 : Bending fracture Type 2 : Shearing fracture \\nType 3 : Compression fracture Type 4 : Avulsion fracture Fernandez classification. Modified and reprinted with permission from reference (9) Type 5 : Combined fractures\\nTreatment:\\nThe treatment decision of a distal radius fracture is complex and depends on the type of the fracture, the age and activeness of the patient and the quality of the bone. At one extr\\neme a stable, undisplaced extra-articular fracture has an excellent prognosis. At the other an unstable, displaced intra-articular fracture is difficult to treat and has a poor prog\\nnosis. If the alignment of the bones is not acceptable, they need to be reduced by closed or open reduction.\\nIndications for Reduction in Distal Radius Fractures:\\nMany authors suggest that distal radial fractures be reduced anatomically, but the real question is 'what is acceptable and what is not?'. Based on basic science and clincal studies\\n some of the recommendations of the International Distal Radius Fracture Study Group are presented in the table on the left, although these recommendations are still the subject of \\nongoing debate (5). Good alignment after closed recuction for extraarticular Colles fracture\\nClosed Reduction:\\nThe initial treatment for most radius fractures is closed reduction and plaster immobilization. A displaced fracture is reduced under regional or general anaesthetic. First the arm \\nis placed under traction to unlock the fragments. The deformity is then reduced with appropriate closed reduction, depending on the type of deformity. A splint or cast is placed in \\nsuch a way that the risk of re-displacement is minimized. X-rays are taken to ensure that the reduction was successful. The cast is usually maintained for about 6 weeks. X-ray in ca\\nst. Unsuccesful reduction. Guidelines for non-acceptable reduction are (8): On the left a control radiograph made after reduction. The reduction was unsuccessful, because there is a\\n dorsal tilt > 10 degrees , loss of inclination and radial shortening.\\nSurgical treatment:\\nAlthough in most cases closed reduction is attempted, surgical intervention is required when there is failure to obtain or maintain closed reduction. 40% of distal radial fractures \\nare considered to be unstable and require surgical fixation. Many techniques of fixation are now available, including percutaneous pinning, intramedullary pinning, external fixation\\n, and internal fixation with customized implants, including the Distal Volar Radius (DVR) system. Surgical fixation allows almost immediate mobility. Ultimately less stiffness and g\\nreater function is possible.

On the left a patient wi\\nth a die-punch fracture, nicely shown on an oblique radiograph. The fracture fragment of the lunate fossa was replaced and fixated with a screw. Volar buttress plate Barton's fractu\\nres are rarely successfully treated with closed reduction due to the shearing nature of the injury. A volar buttress plate is the treatment of choice. Comminution or osteoporotic bo\\nne make external fixation the preferred surgical treatment option. On the left an intraarticular fracture of the distal radius with shortening of the radius.

The volar approach was chosen, because this is an easier approach. Fina\\nl result after one of the plates has been removed.\\nComplications:\\nMalunion:\\nNon-union is uncommon in distal radial fractures, since there is excellent vascularisation of this region. Malunion however is a common complication and is related to radial shorten\\ning, angulation and incongruity of the articular surface. This results in malfunction and early osteoarthritis. More than 2 mm incongruity of articular surface is the most important\\n factor in the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis of the wrist. On the left a patient with malunion.

The role of the radiologist is to separate between benign and possibly malignant le\\nsions, and advise on follow-up imaging or additional invasive imaging techniques. This article summarizes the basics of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, and presents the newest mana\\ngement recommendations of the Fleischner Society.\\nIntroduction:\\nIn 2017 the updated Fleischner Society guideline was published[1]. These replace the recommendations for solid (2005) [2] and subsolid pulmonary nodules (2013) [3]. These new guidel\\nines should reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up examinations and provide clear management decisions. Nodule characterization should be performed on thin-slice CT images ≤1.5 \\nmm, since a small solid nodule may appear to have groundglass density on a thick slice due to partial-volume effect.\\nFleischner Guideline 2017:\\nSolid nodules:\\nSolid pulmonary nodules can represent various etiologies: Perifissural nodules are a separate entity, since they usually represent intrapulmonary lymph nodes, which are benign and n\\need no follow up. They are discussed in the last chapter. In another article we presented some features that can help to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions (click he\\nre) Unfortunately, there is considerable overlap and often no definitive answer can be given based on imaging morphology. Follow-up is therefore a commonly used strategy.\\nSubsolid nodules:\\nMost subsolid nodules are transient and the result of infection or hemorrhage. However, persistent subsolid nodules often represent pathology in the adenocarcinomatous spectrum. No \\nreliable distinction can be made radiologically, although studies suggest that larger size and a solid component are associated with more invasive behaviour. Compared to solid lesio\\nns, persistent subsolid nodules have a much slower growth rate, but carry a much higher risk of malignancy. In a study by Henschke et al., part-solid nodules were malignant in 63%, \\npure groundglass SSNs in 18% and solid nodules only in 7% [4]. Subsolid nodules in the adenocarcinomatous spectrum were formerly known as bronchoalveolar carcinoma or BAC. This term\\ninology should no longer be used. A new pathology-based classification for adenocarcinoma was introduced in 2011 and this current classification makes distinction between: Transient\\n subsolid nodule Transient subsolid nodules usually represent infection or alveolar hemorrhage. To differentiate between transient or persistent subsolid nodules a follow-up CT shou\\nld be obtained. Previously, it was recommended to repeat imaging after 3 months, however, this interval has been increased to 12 months. Because of the slower growth rate, the total\\n follow-up period for persistent subsolid nodules has been increased to 5 years. The images show a 7 mm pure groundglass subsolid nodule in the right upper lobe. On follow-up CT thi\\ns proved to be a transient subsolid nodule. Persistent malignant subsolid nodule These images show a pure groundglass subsolid nodule in the right lower lobe. This lesion demonstrat\\ned growth in a two year interval and proved to be malignant after resection.\\nRisk factors:\\nDefining high- or low-risk is currently more difficult than it was in the old guideline. Previously a high-risk subject was identified based on a history of heavy smoking, history o\\nf lung cancer in a first-degree relative or exposure to asbestos, radon or uranium. Now, it is aimed for to separate high-risk lesions from low-risk ones by considering more paramet\\ners than subject characteristics alone (See Table). Since these risk factors are numerous and have different effects on the malignancy risk, it is proposed to assess final risk cate\\ngories concerning the probability of malignancy 8.\\nNotes:\\nThe guideline recommends follow-up for nodules with an estimated lung cancer risk of around 1% or greater, which is an arbitrary cut-off. The likelihood of malignancy is different f\\nor an incidentally found pulmonary nodule in the lower lobe of a relatively young patient compared to a nodule in the upper lobe of a high-risk heavy smoker, or in a patient with a \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 331}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"known or suspected malignancy. For this reason the Fleischner guideline for the management of pulmonary nodules separates high- and low-risk, and does not apply to subjects younger \\nthan 35 years, immunocompromised patients or patients with cancer [1].\\nPulmonary Nodule Measurements:\\nA lesion which measures 8 x 5 mm has an average of (8 + 5) : 2 = 6.5 mm - rounded up to 7 mm In the Fleischner guidelines nodule dimensions can be obtained using either 2D caliper m\\neasurements or 3D nodule volumetry. Manual 2D caliper measurements should be based on the average of the long- and short-axis diameters of the nodule. These should be obtained on th\\ne same transverse, coronal or sagittal reconstructed image, whichever plane reveals the greatest dimensions [1]. This is new compared to the prior guideline, in which dimensions wer\\ne averaged diameters in the axial plane only [2]. Manual 2D caliper measurements should be rounded to the nearest whole millimeter. In part-solid subsolid nodules both the total nod\\nule as well as the solid component dimensions should be measured separately, both using the abovementioned averaging technique.\\nPerifissural nodules:\\nPerifissural nodules are a separate entity, and likely represent intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Morphologically these are solid, homogeneous nodules with a smooth margin, and are oval \\nor rounded, lentiform or triangular in shape. Their location is within 15 mm of the fissure or the pleura. They may or may not have contact with an interlobar septum. The latter dif\\nferentiates between a typical and atypical PFN (see Figure). PFNs can show significant growth rates on serial imaging, sometimes comparable to malignant nodules. This is not a typic\\nal sign of malignancy, but merely a result of their presumed lymphatic origin. Typical PFNs. Images from Ref [Hoop]. In screening setting it has been shown that none of the 919 typi\\ncal and atypical PFNs were found to be malignant in a 5.5 year follow-up [5]. This confirmed prior results of Ahn et al. [6]. It is assumed that this benign etiology can be extrapol\\nated to clinical subjects, which has recently been supported by a study using routine-care clinical CT imaging [7]. The currently available guidelines recommend that when small nodu\\nles have a perifissural or other juxtapleural location and a morphology consistent with an intrapulmonary lymph node, follow-up CT is not recommended, even if the average dimension \\nexceeds 6 mm.

Infarctions a\\nt pontine level are usually paramedian and sharply defined because the branches of the basilar arery have a sagittal course and do not cross the midline. Bilateral infarcts are rare\\nly observed because these patients do not survive long enough to be studied, but sometimes small bilateral infarcts can be seen.\\nSCA:\\nOn the left MR-image of a cerebellar infarction in the region of the superior cerebellar artery and also in the brainstem in the territory of the PCA.

There are two patterns of border zone infarcts: Infarctions of\\n the deep white matter of the centrum semiovale and corona radiata at the border zone between lenticulostriate perforators and the deep penetrating cortical branches of the MCA or a\\nt the border zone of deep white matter branches of the MCA and the ACA. Deep watershed infarction in a patient with an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery On the left thr\\nee consecutive CT-images of a patient with an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery.

This pattern of deep watershed infarction is quite common and should urge you to examine the carotids.

Borderzone infarcts due to occlusion of the internal carotid On the left images of a patient who has small infarction\\ns in the right hemisphere in the deep borderzone (blue arrowheads) and also in the cortical borderzone between the MCA- and PCA-territory (yellow arrows). There is abnormal signal i\\nn the right carotid (red arrow) as a result of occlusion. In patients with abnormalities that may indicate borderzone infarcts, always study the images of the carotid artery to look\\n for abnormal signal.

On the left an example of infarctions in the deep borderzone and in the cortical borderzone between the ACA- and MCA-territory. The abnormal signal intensity in the right carotid\\n is the result of an occlusion. This combination of findings is so common, that once you know the pattern, you will see it many times.\\nLacunar Infarcts:\\nLacunar infarcts are small infarcts in the deeper parts of the brain (basal ganglia, thalamus, white matter) and in the brain stem. Lacunar infarcts are caused by occlusion of a sin\\ngle deep penetrating artery. Lacunar infarcts account for 25% of all ischemic strokes. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of lacunar infarcts followed by emboli. 25% of patien\\nts with clinical and radiologically defined lacunes had a potential cardiac cause for their strokes. On the left a T2W- and FLAIR image of a lacunar infarct in the left thalamus. On\\n the FLAIR image the infarct is hardly seen. There is only a small area of subtle hyperintensity. Lacunes may be confused with other empty spaces, such as enlarged perivascular Virc\\nhow-Robin spaces (VRS). The VRS are extensions of the subarachnoid space that accompany vessels entering the brain parenchyma. Widening of VRS often first occurs around penetrating \\narteries in the substantia perforata and can be seen on transverse MRI slices around the anterior commisure, even in young subjects (5). On the left CT- and MR-images at the level o\\nf the anterior commisure (blue arrows).

The linea alba is a line\\nformed by the aponeuroses of the right and left rectus muscle and connects both\\nmuscles in the midline. \\nAs the linea alba is an avascular area, it is\\nfrequently used as point of entrance for open abdominal surgery. The linea semilunaris is a curved tendinous line that is located lateral to the rectus\\nabdominis muscle on both sides. \\nHere, the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths\\nconnect with the three lateral abdominal wall muscles: the external oblique,\\nthe internal oblique and the transverse abdominal. This illustration demonstrates how the anterior and posterior rectus\\nsheath are formed by the aponeuroses of the external oblique, internal\\noblique and transverse abdominal muscles.\\nBecause abdominal\\nwall hernias are defects of the fascia of the abdominal wall, these fascia layers need to be brought\\ntogether during surgery. \\nTherefore, the rectus sheaths play an important role\\nin surgical hernia repair.\\nType of abdominal wall defect:\\nPrimary hernia:\\nAbdominal wall hernias can be divided into primary hernias, that are not related to incisions and incisional hernias. Primary abdominal hernias are hernias, that are located at cert\\nain weak spots in the abdominal wall.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 334}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='In the midline are the umbilical and epigastric hernia and lateral are the Spigelian and lumbar hernia.\\nThe Spigelian hernia is an uncommon hernia at a weak spot between the oblique abdominal muscles and the rectus abdominis.\\nPrimary lumbar hernias are uncommon and are also located lateral but more posteriorly, where there is a weak spot between the oblique abdominal muscles and the quadratus lumborum. T\\nhey can be divided into\\nsuperior and inferior lumbar hernias (Greenfellt-Lesshaft and Petit).\\nIncisional hernia:\\nIncisional hernias are the most common and can be located anywhere, where there has been an incision, drain opening, trauma or prior repair of a primary hernia.\\nMost incision hernias are located in the midline.\\nIncisional hernias in the lumbar region can be seen after nephrectomy, hepatopancreatobiliary, or aortic-surgery. Examples of abdominal wall hernias:\\nRectus diastasis:\\nRectus diastasis is a widening between the left and\\nright rectus muscle with protrusion of visceral fat or bowel (figure).\\nThe difference with a hernia is that in diastasis there is no fascia defect.\\nA gap of 2,0 cm between left and right rectus muscle is considered diastasis.\\nBesides transverse width, craniocaudal length of the diastasis should be measured as well. Rectus\\ndiastasis in men is often caused by increased visceral fat and in women due to\\npregnancy.\\nAbdominal wall hernias may coexist with diastasis.\\nDiastasis is important to mention as hernia recurrence is more likely in the presence of rectus diastasis.\\nLocation and size of the defect:\\nThe number of defects and the location of the defect should\\nbe reported.\\nAs mentioned before, hernias are classified as midline as long as they are located\\nwithin the lateral borders of the rectus sheath (e.g. the linea semilunaris). Lateral\\nhernias are located lateral to the linea semilunaris. A description of the size of the abdominal wall\\ndefect is needed for pre-operative planning. \\nThe size consists of width and\\nheight. Here a schematic illustration of the measurements\\nof the defect in two axes: longitudinal and transverse (see Figure).\\nFor\\nmidline hernias cranio-caudal location can be described by the distance to the\\nxiphoid or symphysis pubis. \\nFor lateral hernias, cranio-caudal location\\ncan be described by distance to the costal margin or iliac crest. When multiple defects are present, the combined length and width of all the\\ndefects should be reported because multiple defects are normally treated as one\\nfunctional defect (like Swiss Cheese). \\nHowever if hernias are located\\nrelatively far away, they can be described as separate hernias. Here an example of the measurement of the defect\\nsize. \\nThe hernia width is the maximum distance in between the rectus muscles,\\nmeasured on the axial view at which this distance is largest. \\nThe defect height\\nis the maximum cranio-caudal distance, measured in the sagittal plane. Measurement of multiple hernias This patient has two hernias.\\nThere is a midline hernia (yellow arrowheads) and a lateral hernia (white arrowheads).\\nin this case the total combined length and total width are measured.\\nRectus to Defect Ratio:\\nThe Rectus to Defect Ratio (RDR) is the ratio of\\nthe sum of the width of the left and right rectus compared to the hernia width. Another name for this equation, often used by surgeons, is the Carbonell-index named after Prof Alfre\\ndo Carbonell who first published this. The RDR is a practical and reliable tool to predict\\nthe ability to close the abdominal wall defect during routine hernia repair\\nwithout the need to perform an additional component separation technique (CST). Component separation technique is a surgical techniques in which one of the three lateral muscles is \\ntranssected from the others.\\nThese techniques ‘loosen’ the remaining abdominal wall, but are associated with a higher risks of postoperative complications (see treatment). If the RDR is > 2, routine surgical re\\npair will be able to close the abdominal wall defect in 90% of cases.\\nIf the RDR is < 1.5, in more than 52% of the repairs, additional component separation technique is required. Image\\nIn this\\npatient the Rectus to Defect Ratio: (49 mm + 43 mm) / 157 mm = 0.58. This ratio predicts\\nthat hernia closure will probably not be possible without performing a component separation technique. Image\\nIn a different patient, the Rectus to Defect Ratio\\nis: (73 mm + 81 mm) / 51 mm = 3. Contrary to the previous case, hernia closure will be possible without performing a component separation technique.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 335}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Loss of Domain:\\nLoss of domain is a ratio that describes the amount\\nof peritoneal content that is located in the hernia sac. \\nThis ratio is used to\\npredict the risk of peri-operative complications as well as the need for preoperative\\nbotulinum injections and/or component separation technique. This ratio is calculated by dividing\\nthe hernia sac volume (HSV) by the total peritoneal volume (TPV). \\nThe total\\nperitoneal volume consist of the hernia sac volume plus the\\nabdominal cavity volume (ACV). \\nFor more information on preoperative botox\\ninjections: see treatment. The specific volumes can be obtained through volume\\nrendering or with a simplified method to\\nestimate the volumes, i.e. the height, width and depth of the hernia and abdomen\\nare multiplied by 0.52 (the formula of an ellipse). The height of the abdomen is measured from the\\nupper edge of the liver to the symphysis, the width is measured in between the\\ntransversus abdominal muscles on both sides. \\nThe depth is measured from the\\nanterior side of the vertebral column to the anterior abdominal wall.\\nIf the anterior abdominal wall is no longer present, due to a large ventral hernia, extrapolation of the remnant anterior abdominal wall may be done, so abdominal depth may be measu\\nred.\\nThe\\nheight, width, and depth of the hernia are measured within the hernia sac.\\nFor\\nmore information on Loss of Domain measurments see ref 6. If the loss of domain is larger than 20 %, there is a high risk of surgical complications and abdominal wall repair will re\\nsult in increased\\nabdominal cavity pressure with complications such as respiratory failure and\\nhernia recurrence (ref 7 and ref 8). ImageIn this patient the loss of domain is > 20% and additional strategies will be necessary to increase the abdominal capacity and compliance. \\nIn this patient with a large hernia, the measurements are as follows: The loss of domain in this case is the volume of the hernia sac divided by the volume of the total peritoneal c\\navity: \\n3.1: 8.9 = 35%. This is far\\ngreater than 20% and means that there is a high risk of\\ncomplications during and after a simple abdominal wall repair. In this patient with a hernia, the measurements are as follows: Loss of Domain = 1,12 / 6,2 x 100% = 18 %\\nComplications:\\nIncarceration:\\nThe most\\nserious and acute complication is an incarcerated hernia. \\nAn incarcerating\\nhernia can be diagnosed by looking at two separate features, namely small\\nbowel obstruction and signs of impending strangulation. Actually these are all signs of closed loop obstruction, which is the cause of the strangulation.\\nYou will find more information about closed loop obstruction here. These images are of a 78 year old morbid obese female who has an incisional midline hernia. Study the images and t\\nhen compare to the next images, who were taken one month later, when she presented with a painfully swolen hernia. Now there are signs of strangulation namely: As in any hernia that\\n contains bowel, strangulation in abdominal wall hernias occurs as a result of closed loop obstruction with venous infarction. Image\\nThis patient has a hernia that contains small bowel. \\nThe defect is rather small and there is a stenosis at the point where the bowel enters the hernia sac (yellow arrow) and where it exits the hernia (white arrow).\\nThese two stenosis are proof of a closed loop obstruction.\\nThere is dilatation of the bowel and fat infiltration as a result of ischemia resulting from venous obstruction.

This is another example of a closed loop obstruction within the hern\\nia sac.\\nThe white arrow indicates the first obstruction, where the bowel enters the closed loop.\\nThe yellow arrow indicates the exit.\\nIn this case the closed loop is caused by adhesions within the hernia sack. Notice the fat infiltration and the dilated loops with slightly hyperdense walls.\\nThese are all signs of bowel ischemia. Immediate laparotomy was performed.\\nThe bowel within the hernia sac was ischemic and had a purple color, but after cleavage of the adhesions, the color of the bowel returned to normal.

A mesh is almost always used to provide additional strenght and to minimize the risk of a \\nrecurrent hernia. A mesh can be placed in many positions, but preferably located posterior to the rectus muscle. \\nThis is called a retrorectus repair as originally described by Rives, Stoppa and Wantz.\\nAn intra-peritoneal positioned mesh, which can be placed by open or laparoscopic repair, has a greater chance of bowel erosion and fistula formation on the long run. Retrorectus rep\\nair\\nRives-Stoppa repair:\\nIn the Rives-Stoppa repair the skin is\\nincised and the hernia sac is opened. The bowel is put to the side and\\nprotected by gauze. On both sides the posterior rectus sheath is transsected\\nfrom the rectus muscle, creating the retromuscular space. This\\nspace is dissected laterally, just up to the linea semilunaris. \\nThen, the\\nposterior rectus sheaths from both sides are sutured together in the midline.\\nOn this posterior layer, a mesh is positioned. \\nThen, the rectus muscles are\\nbrought together, and the anterior rectus sheaths from both sides are sutured\\nin the midline.\\nComponent separation:\\nThe above-described\\nsurgical repair is quite straightforward and can be used for small and medium\\nsized hernias. \\nFor large hernias or hernias with large loss of domain,\\nit will not be possible to medialize the rectus muscles without too much tension. Component separation techniques (CST) are surgical strategies that facilitate\\nmedialization of the rectus muscles, by transection one of the lateral\\nabdominal wall muscles from the other two. In the Ramirez technique\\n(also known as the open anterior CST), after mobilization of the skin and subcutaneous tissue up to the semilunar line, \\nthe external oblique is\\ndissected from the internal oblique.\\nIt\\nprovides about 10cm of medialization, but is associated with a high risk\\nof postoperative wound complications, because of the skin mobilization. Images\\nTransversus Abdominus Release (oTAR):\\nThe open posterior Components Separation or Transversus Abdominus Release (oTAR) is now the preferred treatment for large abdominal hernias.\\nThe first step in TAR is entry into the retrorectus space from the posterior side and dissection is proceeded laterally to the linea semilunaris, the most lateral aspect of the retr\\norectus space. \\nNext the posterior rectus sheath is longitudinally divided as laterally as possible, taking care to avoid the subcostal nerves, and then the fibers of the muscular part of the Trans\\nversus Abdominus are divided with electrocautery.\\nBy dividing the transversus abdominis muscle from the oblique internal muscles, it becomes possible to approximate both the posterior rectus sheaths. The retromuscular space is then\\n developed to as far as the lateral border of the psoas muscle. \\nThe dissection is repeated on the opposite site and may be carried superiorly to the central tendon of the diaphragm, using a subxiphoid and retrosternal dissection. It may also be \\ndeveloped inferiorly to the retropubic space. \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 337}),\n",

Clinically these conditions are indistinguishable. CT is the most accurate imaging modality for the initial dia\\ngnosis, differentiation and staging. This review will discuss the imaging features and important pitfalls. *by Ferco Berger, Otto van Delden and Robin Smithuis Radiology department \\nof the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam and the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands.*\\nImaging Protocol:\\nImage protocol will be based on the type of scanner that is available. Our imaging protocol is based on a 4 slice helical CT-scanner. For the evaluation of patients with suspected A\\nAS, we use 4x2,5 mm collimation technique\\nwith 5 mm axial reconstructions and coronal, sagittal and oblique MPRs. A non-enhanced scan of the thoracic aorta is included for the detection of an intramural hematoma (IMH). This\\n is followed by a contrast-enhanced scan of the aorta in the arterial phase with bolus triggering and in the venous phase (100 ml Visipaque, 3ml/sec). Contrast differences between a\\nrterial and venous phase can be helpful in differentiating true and false lumen. The iliac tract is included for evaluation of endovascular treatment possibilities. The branches of \\nthe arch are visualized to evaluate the extend of dissection and awareness of possible neurological complications.

Important reduction of artifacts and thus decreasing pitfalls, can be achieved by: Also keep in min\\nd that placing ROIs can be difficult with dissected lumina (should be just distal to the aortic arch).)

Classic Aortic Dissection (AD), Intramural Hematoma (IMH) and Penetrating Atherosclerotic Ulcer (PAU) ar\\ne distinct entities, but closely related. This is reflected upon in their identical therapeutical strategies. The main goal for the radiologist is not only to detect which entity is\\n causing the clinical problem, but more importantly to differentiate between type A and B!\\nStanford classification:\\nThe Acute Aortic Syndrome (AAS) is classified according to Stanford.\\nStanford Type A lesions involve the ascending aorta and aortic arch and may or may not involve the descending aorta. \\nStanford Type B lesions involve the thoracic aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. The Stanford classification has replaced the DeBakey classification (type I= ascending, arch\\n and descending aorta: type II= only ascending aorta: type III= only descending aorta). Treatment options for the 2 subgroups of the acute aortic syndrome (AAS) are very different: \\nStanford type A will be treated with surgery or endovascular therapy.

Management decisions are based on the following information: Type B dissection. Green arrow indica\\ntes entry. False lumen is indicated by yellow arrows and is seen spiraling around the true lumen.\\nImaging features:\\nDissection into brachiocephalic arteries:\\nCarefully sort out which branches of the aortic arch are involved. Make sure from which lumina they arise. Left: Continued dissection into the celic trunk showing bigger false lumen\\n, significantly contributing to organ perfusion.Right: : SMA and renal artery involvement, illustrating possible cause of organ malperfusion\\nDissection into abdominal arteries:\\nThe celiac trunc, SMA and right renal artery flow usually originates from the true lumen. Left renal artery flow mostly originates from the false lumen. Impaired perfusion of end-or\\ngans can be due to 2 mechanisms: 1) static = continuing dissection in the feeding artery (usually treated by stenting) 2) dynamic = dissection flap hanging in front of ostium like a\\n curtain (usually treated with fenestration). This may be hard to discern, MPR's can be helpfull. Look for the re-entry point, usually to be found in the iliac tract. Provide inform\\nation about tortuisity and calcifications of the iliac tract if endovascular procedures are being considered. LEFT: Dissected SMARIGHT: No change at 20 months follow up When no end-\\norgans are compromised and there is sufficient perfusion, dissection can be left alone. This may persist for a long time without clinical consequence, as is seen in the patient on t\\nhe left with follow-up of 2 years. Some dissections remained unchanged during a follow up of more than 5 years. Left: pericardial fluid / hematoma indicates rupture of the dissected\\n aorta. Even small amounts are proving rupture, though hematoma can be extensive such as in this case.Right: Massive hematoma caused by rupture of the dissected aorta into the media\\nstinum and pleural cavity, no pericaldial hematoma.\\nRupture into pericardium and thoracic cavity:\\nEven the slightest amount of fluid in pericardium, mediastinum or pleural cavity is suggestive of rupture of the dissection. The cases on the left show evident rupture, with presenc\\ne of extensive hematoma in above mentioned locations. Note extreme hematothorax and hematomediastinum, causing shift of the mediastinum and compression on the pulmonary veins and ev\\nen aorta. No pericardial effusion visible. Type B aortic dissection in a non-operable patient. At 5 days flow reappeared in false lumen. Finally at 9 months a saccular aneurysm has \\nformed. The case on the left is a patient who presented with a fully thrombosed false lumen. 5 days after initial presentation this patient complained of acute chest pain mimicking \\nthe earlier episode. Re-examination showed recurrence of flow in the false lumen, locally contained, but with alarming adhering pleural effusion. The patient could not undergo surgi\\ncal or endovascular repair for various reasons and was treated consevatively. LEFT: Dissection with a thrombosed false lumen. RIGHT: Aneurysm with thrombus on the inner side of the \\nintimal calcifications.\\nAneurysm with thrombus versus thrombosed dissection:\\nIt can be difficult to differentiate an aneurysm with thrombus from a dissection with a thrombosed false lumen. If there are intima calcifications this will be very helpfull. A fals\\ne lumen displaces the intimal calcifications.\\nIntramural Hematoma:\\nIntramural Hematoma is a result of ruptured vasa vasorum Brief facts: Classic example of IMH. Hyperdense hematoma on NECT. Intima calcifications surround the true lumen. What the cl\\ninician needs to know Predictors of mortality: Ascending Aorta > 5 cm ? IMH thickness > 2 cm Pericardial effusion (to less extend pleural effusion) On the left a Intramural hematoma\\n, hyperdense on a NECT. Same case. CECT of Intramural hematoma type B. Same case contrast enhanced CT. Note that the IMH does not spiral around the true lumen, like in classic AD, h\\nelping to differentiate both. Essentially, this is not important, therapeutical decision will be made by whether this IMH is classified as Type A or Type B IMH! Note that there is n\\no pericardial effusion. IMH thickness stays below 2 cm, making regression of this Type B IMH likely (up to 80%).\\nPenetrating Atherosclerotic Ulcer:\\nPAU is defined as an ulceration of an atheromatous plaque that has eroded the inner elastic layer of the aortic wall. It has reached the media and produced a hematoma within the med\\nia. Brief facts: Typical illustration of PAU, focal outpouchings of contrast, separating extensive intimal calcifications What the clinician needs to know\\nComplications:\\nThe complications of a Penetrating Atherosclerotic Ulcer include: However most patients have a poor prognosis because of generalized atherosclerosis leading to diffuse organ failure\\n.

L4*/L5: enhancing capsule is L4. Non-pe\\nripheral washout or threshold growth is L5.\\nLI-RADS categories:\\nNon enhancing lesions in a cirrhotic liver, compatible with cysts, LR-1\\nMass versus Pseudolesion:\\nLI-RADS uses the term ‘observations’ to describe focal abnormalities which are distinct from the background liver parenchyma. \\nIt is preferred not to use the word ‘lesion’ or ‘nodule’ as some of these abnormalities do not represent true lesions but are the result of a perfusion alteration, a hypertrophic ps\\neudomass or an artifact.\\nWhen to use LI-RADS:\\nLI-RADS can only be used in patients with cirrhosis and chronic HBV infection. LI-RADS should not be used in patients with cirrhosis caused by vascular disorders (see table).\\nIn these patients the formation of benign hyperplastic nodules may resemble HCC on imaging and cause false positive diagnoses.\\nMajor features:\\nTypical HCC with APHE and washout.\\nArterial Phase non-rim Hyperenhancement (APHE):\\nHere an image in the late arterial phase in a patient with cirrhosis. \\nThere is an observation with non-rim hyperenhancement (yellow arrow).\\nIn a late phase there is washout.\\nThese are typical features of HCC. The other lesion (green arrow) is a treated lesion, which we will discuss later. Typical HCC with APHE, washout and enhancing capsule\\nWashout - Capsule:\\nThis is another patient with an enhancing lesion and washout. \\nNote also the enhancing capsule on the delayed phase. A capsule is one of the major features of HCC and can be complete or partial. \\nA capsule should always be included within the measurement of the lesion. LEFT: Hyperenhancing observation detected in segment 5. RIGHT: follow up 3 months later shows growth.\\nSize - Threshold growth:\\nSize also determines in which category a lesion is placed.\\nThe bigger the lesion, the higher the chance that it is a HCC. An observation should be measured in the phase, sequence or plane in which margins are the most clear.\\nMeasurement on the arterial phase and DWI sequence should be avoided as size could be overestimated due to summation of perilesional enhancement and anatomic distortion respectively\\n. Threshold growth is also an important finding.\\nIt is defined as more than 50% growth in less than 6 months The images show an observation in segment 5 of the liver demonstrating arterial hyperenhancement.\\nThe lesion has grown from 8 mm to 21 mm in 3 months, which means that there is threshold growth.\\nLI-RADS 1 - definitely benign:\\nObservations in this category are definitely benign. Examples of LR-1 lesions are definite: The images show lesions that show no enhancement in both late arterial, portal venous and\\n delayed phase. Typical haemangioma in a patient with livercirrhosis.\\nLI-RADS 2 - probably benign:\\nLR-2 observations are probably benign.\\nOf all LR-2 lesions about 16% are HCC and 18% are malignant. Examples of LR-2 lesions are probable: Distinct nodules < 20 mm without malignant features (see section of ancillary mal\\nignant features) can be categorized as LR-2. Examples are nodules which are T1 hyperintense, T2 hypointense, siderotic or hepatobiliary phase hyperintense. The CT-images show a lesi\\non with enhancement that follows the bloodpool, which is typical for a hemangioma. Continue with the MR of this patient. MRI-images of the same patient. The enhancement of this lesi\\non follows the enhancement of the blood pool.\\nLI-RADS 3 - intermediate probability:\\nLR-3 observations vary from benign lesions to dysplastic nodules to HCC. \\nMany LR-3s are vascular pseudolesions. \\nOf all LR-3 lesions approximately 37% are HCC and 39% are malignant (1).

The categorizing of an observation as LR-4 depends on the size of the lesion, the presence of APHE and the amou\\nnt of additional major features (see LIRADS table).

A follow up CT was done, showing severe progression of the tumor as well as vascul\\nar involvement of the anterior right portal vein (white arrow). \\nNow we are sure of tumor invasion in the portal vein.\\nLR-M - malignant:\\nThe category of LR-M should be applied to malignant appearing lesions that do not have the typical characteristics of HCC. Non-HCC malignant lesions either show: Categorizing a lesi\\non as LR-M does not mean the diagnosis of  HCC is excluded. \\nOf all LR-M lesions 2/3 are non-HCC malignancies like intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (CCA) or combined HCC-CCA and about 5% are benign. \\nThis small percentage of benign malignant appearing lesions usually represent sclerosing hemangiomas or abscesses.

These lesions are either characterized as non evaluable, nonviable, equivocal\\n or viable. \\nTreatment related parenchymal perfusional changes may mimic or obscure residual tumor, potentially leading to false positive or false negative assessment of viability.\\nIf there is any uncertainty between two categories, the one reflecting lower certainty should be applied. LI-RADS does not apply for systemic treatment. LRTR non viable If an observ\\nation shows no residual major or ancillary features or has completely disappeared it can be characterized as non-viable. If typical post-treatment features are noted in the area of \\ntreatment and there are no signs of residual malignancy, a lesion can be considered as non viable. The images show an ablation defect in segment V adjacent to gallbladder  and hepat\\nic vein without residual areas of arterial enhancement or washout.\\nThis was classified as  LRTR non viable. LRTR non-viable The image in the late arterial phase show normal post treatment pattern with rim-like hyperenhancement of the surrounding li\\nver parenchyma due to hyperemia after DEB-TACE (arrow). DEB TACE is drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization, a relative new endovascular treatment based on the use of micr\\nospheres to release chemotherapeutic agents within a target lesion with controlled pharmacokinetics. \\nDEB-TACE nowadays represents one of the most used treatments for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. LRTR non-viable Arterial enhancing lesions which were treated with Deb TACE. \\nThere is mild perilesional enhancement noted on the follow-up scan, which is a normal post-treatment finding. LRTR equivocal The enhancement pattern is atypical for treatment-specif\\nic expected enhancement and otherwise not meeting criteria for probably or definitely viable. \\nFor some treatments early post-treatment enhancement patterns may not reliably differentiate viable from non viable tumor and therefore the most appropriate category in this early p\\nost-treatment period may be LRTR equivocal. Area of arterial enhancement without washout in a segment 5 ablation defect (arrow), LRTR-equivocal. LRTR viable When measuring viable tu\\nmor only the largest continuous area of enhancement or washout should be measured (not traversing non enhancing area). \\nIf residual enhancement  within a lesion is nodular, the largest nodule should be reported. LRTR viable If a new tumor arises adjacent to a treated lesion this observation should be\\n assigned a new non-treated LIRADS category. If a new observation is noted at the surgical margin it should be assigned a category according to the treated lesion algorithm. The cor\\nonal images shows a large lesion treated with TACE with residual areas of mild arterial enhancement and washout due to untreated supply via a phrenic artery (yellow arrow): LRTR-via\\nble.

These are all images of a patient without cirrhosis, so we cannot use L\\nI-RADS.\\nThere are multiple heterogenous lesions with mild peripheral enhancement in the arterial phase. \\nSome lesions are mildly hypodense compared to adjacent liver parenchyma on the portal phase and larger lesions have a necrotic center. \\nMultiplicity and targetoid enhancement pattern are not typical for HCC and suggestive of metastatic disease. This patient had a neuroendocrine tumor with liver metastases. These ima\\nges are of a patient with a steatotic liver.\\nAlthough some of these patient have a mildly greater chance of developing HCC, we cannot use LI-RADS. There are  multiple lesions which are hyperenhancing in the arterial and portal\\n venous phase. This is another example of hypervascular metastases.\\nThis patient was known to have a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas.\\nProtocols:\\nEarly aterial phase (left). Late arterial phase (right). CT protocol Required images for CT are late-arterial, portal venous and delayed phase. \\nPrecontrast images are recommended after locoregional treatment. Late arterial phase\\nThis phase refers to the hepatic arterial phase in which the hepatic artery and branches are fully enhanced and the hepatic veins are not yet enhancing. HCC usually enhances more st\\nrongly in the late arterial phase showing early enhancement of the portal vein and is therefore preferred over the early arterial phase, when there is no enhancement of PV and poor \\nenhancement of the HCC. Notice poor enhancement of liver and portal vein (white arrow) in the early arterial phase and good enhancement of both hepatic artery (white arrow) and port\\nal vein (green arrow) in the late arterial phase. Portal venous phase Portal venous phaseThere is complete enhancement of the portal veins with antegrade filling of hepatic veins. \\nIn this phase the normal liver parenchyma is usually at its peak of enhancement.\\nHypovascular lesions like most metastases are best detected in this phase, but hypervascular lesions are poorly seen because there is poor contrast between the good enhancement of t\\nhe liver parenchyma and the hypervascular lesion. Delayed phase Delayed phase Portal and hepatic veins are enhanced but less than in the portal venous phase. \\nLiver parenchyma is enhanced but also less than in PV phase.\\nThis phase is typically acquired 2-5 min after injection. This phase is helpful in detecting wash out of HCC and in detecting sclerotic lesions like cholangiocarcinoma or sclerotic \\nmetastases like sometimes seen in breast cancer.

US helps in assessing the neurologic status of the child, sin\\nce clinical examination and symptoms are often nonspecific. It gives information about immediate and long term prognosis. by Erik Beek and Floris Groenendaal\\nIntroduction:\\nUse both the sector and linear transducer and examine the greater fontanel and if necessary also the lesser and sphenoidal fontanel. Ultrasound is a fast and bedside examination whi\\nch makes it ideal for premature infants. Try to get all the information you can. Do not limit yourself to only one transducer or only one acustic window (figure). Generally the larg\\ne fontanel is used as acoustic window. The small fontanel however is a good window to the occipital lobes. This can be usefull in patients with borderline hyperechogenicity in these\\n areas. Disadvantages of US are:\\nPeri Ventricular Leukomalacia (PVL):\\nPVL is also known as Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) of the preterm. It is a white matter disease that affects the periventricular zones. In prematures this white matter zone \\nis a watershed zone between deep and superficial vessels. Until recently ischemia was thought to be the single cause of PVL, but probably other causes (infection, vasculitis) play a\\nn additional role. PVL presents as areas of increased periventricular echogenicity. Normally the echogenicity of the periventricular white matter should be less than the echogenicit\\ny of the choroid plexus. PVL occurs most commonly in premature infants born at less than 33 weeks gestation (38% PVL) and less than 1500 g birth weight (45% PVL). Detection of PVL i\\ns important because a significant percentage of surviving premature infants with PVL develop cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment or visual disturbances. More than 50% of infants\\n with PVL or grade III hemmorrhage develop cerebral palsy.\\nGrading PVL:\\nPVL is graded according to the signs as listed in the Table on the left. Regular sonographic examination is mandatory as cysts in PVL can develop as long as 4 weeks after birth (esp\\necially in prematures\\nCranial ultrasonographic findings may be normal in patients who go on to develop clinical and delayed imaging findings of PVL. A good protocol is US-examination at least once a week\\n until discharge\\n?nd at the age of 40 weeks. Sagittal image of a child with PVL grade 1 PVL grade 1 PVL is diagnosed as grade 1 if there are areas of increased periventricular echogenicity without a\\nny cyst formation persisting for more than 7 days. Increased periventricular echogenicity is however a nonspecific finding that must be differentiated from the normal periventricula\\nr halo or normal hyperechoic 'blush' posterosuperior to the ventricular trigones. Suspect PVL if the echogenicity is asymmetric, coarse, globular or more hyperechoic than the choroi\\nd plexus. The abnormal periventricular echotexture of PVL usually disappears at 2-3 weeks. PVL can be differentiated from hemorrhages because PVL lacks mass effect. Transverse and s\\nagittal image of a child with PVL grade 2. PVL grade 2 The images on the left demonstrate a PVL grade 2 with small periventricular cysts. The echogenicity has resolved at the time o\\nf cyst formation. 2% of the preterm neonates born before 32 weeks develop cystic PVL. The severity of PVL is related to the size and distribution of these cysts. Cystic PVL has been\\n identified on cranial ultrasounds on the first day of life, indicating that the adverse event was at least 2 weeks prenatal rather than perinatal or postnatal. US is highly reliabl\\ne in the detection of cystic WM injury (PVL grade II or more), but has significant limitations in the demonstration of noncystic WM injury (PVL grade I). This deficiency of neonatal\\n cranial US is important, because noncystic WM injury is considerably more common than cystic WM injury. Sagittal image demonstarting extensive PVL grade 3 PVL grade 3 PVL is diagno\\nsed as grade 3 if there are areas of increased periventricular echogenicity, that develop into extensive periventricular cysts in the occipital and fronto-parietal region. Coronal a\\nnd transverse images demonstrating PVL grade 4 PVL grade 4 PVL is diagnosed as grade 4 if there are areas of increased periventricular echogenicity in the deep white matter developi\\nng into extensive subcortical cysts. PVL grade 4 is seen mostly in fullterm neonates as opposed to PVL grade 1-3, which is a disease of the preterm neonate.\\nFlaring persisting beyond the first week of life is by definition PVL garde 1.\\nFlaring:\\nTransverse and sagittal images demonstrating flaring in a premature infant. The term flaring is used to describe the slightly echogenic periventricular zones, that are seen in many \\npremature infants in the first week of life. During this first week it is not sure if this is a normal variant or a sign of PVL grade 1. Flaring persisting beyond the first week of \\nlife is by definition PVL grade 1. LEFT: Initial examination shows flaring.RIGHT: Follow up one week later shows normal periventricular white matter. Follow up is needed to differen\\ntiate flaring from PVL grade I. The case on the left shows a premature infant with flaring. At follow up no cyst formation was found and after the first week a normal periventricula\\nr white matter was seen.\\nGerminal Matrix Hemorrhage:\\nGerminal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is also known as periventricular hemorrhage or preterm caudothalamic hemorrhage. These germinal matrix hemorrhages occur in the highly vascular but \\nalso stress sensitive germinal matrix, which is located in the caudothalamic groove. This is the subependymal region between the caudate nucleus and thalamus. Most infants are asymp\\ntomatic or demonstrate subtle signs that are easily overlooked. These hemorhages are subsequently found on surveillance sonography. Grade 1 intracranial hemorrhageSagittal and coron\\nal US of subependymal hemorrhage located in the groove between the thalamus and the nucleus caudatus. Grade 1 intracranial hemorrhage On the left an intracranial hemorrhage confined\\n to the caudothalamic groove. It is staged as grade 1 hemorrhage.

Yellow arrow indicating cyst formation within venous infarcti\\non. Same patient as above. Two weeks later the venous infarction has developed into a hypoechoic area with cyst formation. Intracranial hemorrhage grade 4 Grade 4 intracranial hemor\\nrhage Originally these grade 4 hemorrhages were thought to result from subependymal bleeding into the adjacent brain. Today however most regard these grade 4 hemorrhages to be venou\\ns hemorrhagic infartions, which are the result of compression of the outflow of the veins by the subependymal hemorrhage. On the left a grade 4 hemorrhage. There is a large subepend\\nymal bleeding but also a large area with increased echogenicity in the brain parenchyma lateral to the ventricle. This is probably the result of a venous infarct. These venous infar\\nctions resolve with cyst formation. These cysts can merge with the lateral ventricle, finally resulting into a porencephalic cyst.

Cavum septi pellucidi is seen in between the lateral ventricles.RIGHT: Midsagittal image demonstrating a ca\\nvum vergae.\\nCavum septi pellucidi, cavum vergae and cavum of the velum interpositum:\\nWell known variants are the cavum of the septum pellucidum and the cavum vergae. The more premature the baby, the more frequently these cavities are present. They can persist until \\nadulthood. A less frequently seen variant is the cavum of the velum interpositum. This presents as a cyst-like structure in the region of the tectum. It's shape is compared to a hel\\nmet. It can easily be confused with a subarachnoid cyst or a cyst of the pineal gland.\\nChoroid plexus cyst:\\nIn postnatal US these cysts of the chorio?d plexus are often incidental findings without clinical consequences. Choroid plexus cysts (CPC) are however of importance for obstetrician\\ns. At prenatal US these cysts can be predictive of trisomy 18. About half of babies with Trisomy 18 show a CPC on ultrasound, but nearly all of these babies will also have other abn\\normalities on the ultrasound, especially in the heart, hand, and feet. An exeption must be made for cysts that arise close to the foramen of Monro. Although these cysts often disapp\\near spontaneously, follow up US is necessary to ensure disappearance. Some may produce symptoms of raised intracranial pressure due to obstruction to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) f\\nlow.\\nBenign macrocrania:\\nBenign macrocrania is also known as extraventricular obstructive hydrocephalus. This is seen in children between 6 months and 2 years. The head circumference is above the 97th perce\\nntile. After the age of 2 years the head size normalizes. Often the mother or father of the child had large heads at that age. The cause is not known. Most state that it is a normal\\n condition, although some state that these children have a slight developmental delay. LEFT: Normal subarachnoid space is RIGHT: avoid pressure on the fontanel. When children with a\\n large head are presented for US, examine the superficial subarachnoid space and the ventricles.\\nThe normal subarachnoid space measures less then 3 mm. The ventricles are often slightly enlarged. These prominent subarachnoid space and ventricular system in these children should\\n not be interpreted as cerebral atrophia, as in atrophia there is a small head circumpherence.\\nMineralizing vasculopathy:\\nMineralizing vasculopathy can be seen in the thalamostriatal and lenticulostriatal arteries and is caused by calcification of the arterial wall. A wide range of perinatal, acquired,\\n and nonspecific clinical conditions may result in this sonographic finding. In the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital these children used to be tested for TORCH-infection, but currentl\\ny the only test that is done is a urine-test for CMV. Germinolytic cysts Are located at the caudothalamic groove. They are tear shaped. There are no signs of intracerebral hemorrhag\\ne and these children have no neurological sequelae. The etiology is not known. Pseudocyst These are also called coarctation of the lateral ventricle. They are often bilaterally and \\nhave no neurological sequelae 1+2 = germinolytic cysts and pseudocysts, 3 = cystic periventricular leukomalacia, 4 = cysts as a result of a venous infarct\\nCysts:\\nIf cysts are seen around the lateral ventricles, it is important to determine their position in regard to the upper part of the lateral ventricle (figure).\\nVentricular measurement:\\nMeasurement of the ventricular system should be done in an easy reproducible sonographic plane. Use a coronal section through the lateral ventricles slightly posterior to the forame\\nn of Monro. You will see 3 echogenic dots representing the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles and in the roof of the third ventricle. Furthermore you should see a symmetrical \\nimage of the Sylvian fissure on both sides and the hippocampus (green and orange arrows).\\nLevene index:\\nUp to 40 weeks of gestational age the Levene-index should be used and after 40 weeks the ventricular index. The Levene index is the absolute distance between the falx and the latera\\nl wall of the anterior horn in the coronal plane at the level of the third ventricle. This is performed for the left and right side. These measurements can be compared to the refere\\nnce curve and are quite usefull for further follow-up. LEFT: Standard measurement of the ventricular index.RIGHT: There is ballooning of the ventricles and the index measurement und\\nerestimates the severity of the ventricular widening.\\nVentricular index:\\nAfter 40 weeks the ventricular index or frontal horn ratio should be used, i.e. the ratio of the distance between the lateral sides of the ventricles and the biparietal diameter. Wh\\nen using this ratio you have to realise, that when the ventricular system widens, the frontal horns tend to enlarge in the craniocaudal direction more than in the left to right dime\\nnsion. Measurement of the falx to the most lateral point of the lateral ventricle. Real-time ultrasound was used to make exact measurements from the lateral wall of the body of the \\nlateral ventricle to the falx (the ventricular index) in 273 infants of varying gestational ages (5). The measurement performed in an axial plane through the temporoparietal bone co\\nrrelated closely with an actual measurement made in coronal plane in 50 infants. A cross-sectional centile chart was drawn up of the normal range for this measurement from 27 to 42 \\nweeks' postmenstrual age. A further chart showing the rate of change of the ventricular index allowed growth of the ventricles to be assessed in a longitudinal manner. Use of these \\ncharts permits early detection of hydrocephalus or dilated ventricles secondary to cerebral atrophy. A more realiable indicator of widening of the ventricular system would be an are\\na- or volume-measurement. This however is more time consuming. So although ventricular index has shortcommings it is still the most commonly used. In general practise, studying the \\nimages by eye is reliable, provided, that standard planes are used. by Paul Govaert, Gent University Hospital and Linda S. de Vries, Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis. with contributions \\nof Frank van Bel, Erik Beek, Dirk Voet, An Bael, Linde Goossens\\n2.

The recommended treatment of ACT has\\nchanged over the years from resection to curettage\\nand even \"watchful waiting\" with MRI follow-up [1].\\nDue to these changes in management, imaging plays a\\nmajor role in the diagnosis and follow up of ACT. In this article we will discuss: Follow up of ACT. Introduction\\nIntroduction:\\nCartilage tumors share the characteristic production of a chondroid matrix with frequently typical matrix calcifications.\\nThey vary in severity from benign enchondromas and locally aggressive atypical cartilaginous tumors (ACT) to malignant chondrosarcomas.\\nAbout 10% of chondrosarcomas are dedifferentiated, which is a highly malignant variant of chondrosarcoma. Atypical cartilaginous tumors (ACT)\\nhave been classified as intermediate grade chondroid tumors by the World Health\\nOrganization in 2013. “Intermediate”\\nmeans that these tumors may behave locally aggressive but rarely\\nmetastasize (< 2%). Since 2020 intermediate lesions in the appendicular skeleton are called ACT, while the same lesions\\nlocated in the axial skeleton are called chondrosarcoma grade I (CS-I) because they have a poorer outcome. The term CS-I is therefore reserved for these tumors in the\\naxial skeleton, meaning the spine,\\npelvis, ribs, sternum, scapula and\\nskull base. Task of the radiologist\\nEnchondromas are benign and do not need follow up.\\nHigh grade chondrosarcomas are treated with wide resection, since they are insensitive to chemotherapy and radiation.\\nFor ACTs watchful waiting\\nwith MRI follow up is replacing surgical intervention in many centers.\\nGiven these developments,\\nthe most important task for the musculoskeletal radiologist is to differentiate\\nACTs from high grade chondrosarcomas.\\nTerminology in Chondroid tumors:\\nThis figure demonstrates\\nexamples to explain the terminology used to describe chondroid tumors. In some examples there can\\nbe more than one typical finding.\\nHow to diagnose a Chondroid tumor:\\nX-ray:\\nOn radiographs, chondroid tumors show\\nfoci of nodular, popcorn-like matrix mineralization. These calcifications may be present within the entire spectrum of\\nchondroid tumors. Often the tumor\\nsize is underestimated on a radiograph, as frequently only the mineralized part of the\\ntumor is visible. In the phalanges,\\nenchondromas may present as purely osteolytic tumors, not necessarily\\ncontaining matrix calcifications. Image\\nThere is a small area of 1.5 cm with popcorn calcifications in the distal metaphysis of the femur without extension to the cortex. \\nThis is an enchondroma. Images\\nThe radiograph demonstrates an\\nosteolytic lesion in the distal femur containing typical popcorn calcifications\\nand showing anterior cortical scalloping (arrowhead). On the sagittal MRI we can appreciate\\nthat the tumor is larger than the area of calcifications on the radiograph,\\nmeasuring 8 cm. \\nThe tumor is hyperintense on T2 STIR and contains multiple foci\\nof low signal intensity, corresponding to the chondroid matrix calcifications\\non the radiograph. Conclusion\\nSince there is no periosteal reaction or soft tissue mass, these findings fit with the diagnosis of ACT. \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 345}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='The patient remains in follow-up.\\nCT:\\nCT is not part of the routine imaging work-up in chondroid tumors,\\nhowever it may aid in the detection of subtle matrix mineralization in case\\nthere is doubt about the diagnosis. CT can also be helpful in axial\\nlesions where radiographs are not sufficient - such as the skull base or pelvis\\n- to quantify bone destruction and the extent of the tumor. If there is doubt about cortical\\ndestruction in an expansile lesion on MR, CT will usually clearly demonstrate\\nthe presence or absence of a cortex. \\nFinally,\\nCT is useful to assess pathological fractures and for example to assess whether\\nthese extend into a joint. Images MRI cor T1W-image shows an eccentric,\\nslightly expansile lesion in the caput and collum of the right femur. It is difficult to appreciate whether\\nthe medial cortex is only thinned or destructed. Therefore an unenhanced CT was done\\nin addition. Unenhanced CT demonstrates a lytic\\nlesion containing chondroid matrix calcifications. There is cortical scalloping\\nmedially, but no cortical destruction. Curettage was performed to exclude a clear cell chondrosarcoma. This is\\na rare subtype of chondrosarcoma which occurs in the epiphysis of long bones in\\nyoung adults. Pathology diagnosis: ACT.\\nMR:\\nOn fluid sensitive sequences - preferably T2W with fat suppression - cartilage nodules are hyperintense and grouped together. \\nAfter gadolinium contrast administration, cartilage tumors enhance with a typical septonodular enhancement.\\nThis feature is helpful in distinguishing cartilage tumors from other bone tumors.\\nCalcifications can be visible on MRI and show low signal intensity on all sequences. Unfortunately, diffusion weighted\\nimaging has been shown not to be of use in differentiating low grade from high\\ngrade cartilage tumors. Interspersed fatChondroid nodules may have\\nfatty marrow between them, also called interspersed or entrapped fat. This is best assessed on\\nT1-weighted images and is present in lesions at the benign side of the\\nspectrum, so in ACTs. For example, during follow\\nup of ACTs, the amount of interspersed fat and calcifications may increase,\\nwhich can be interpreted as “maturation” of a lesion.\\nThis may\\neven cause decrease in size of the tumor over time. Both fatty maturation and\\nincreased calcification of a chondroid tumor over time are signs of benignity. ScallopingCartilage tumors may cause scalloping\\nof the cortex, which appears as sharp osteolysis extending from the marrow\\ncavity. The Birmingham group proposed the\\nBACTIP criteria for MRI assessment of chondroid tumors and guidance towards referral to a\\ntertiary center or end of follow up. BACTIP defined scalloping as\\nlocalized if less than 10% of the lesion circumference was involved, measured\\non an axial slice with the largest tumor diameter. Whereas scalloping of more than 10%\\nof the lesion circumference was defined as extensive. Relevance of the depth of cortical\\nscalloping remains unclear. Image\\nThe axial T1 SPIR post contrast shows cortical scalloping anteriorly over approximately 43/360 degrees.\\nThis means scalloping of 12% of the tumor circumference (extensive).\\nAlso note more subtle posterior cortical scalloping (arrowhead).\\nThis tumor shows septonodular, peripheral enhancement.\\nNote the low signal intensity foci in keeping with calcifications. Figure courtesy of Wouter Stomp MR perfusion\\nPerfusion or dynamic contrast\\nenhanced MRI is a functional imaging technique in which early enhancement of\\nthe tumor is monitored after an intravenous gadolinium bolus injection.\\nIn cartilage tumors, perfusion has been used to differentiate\\nenchondroma from chondrosarcomas. A cut off of 10 seconds is used for\\nfast versus slow enhancement. However, overlap in early enhancement patterns of\\nchondroid tumors may occur, for example: fast enhancing enchondromas exist,\\nbut also slow enhancing ACTs. Images\\nThere is a tumor of less than 2 cm in the distal femur metaphysis. \\nThe lesion is hyperintense on T2, iso-intense on T1 and shows septonodular enhancement. There is no relation with the cortex. On the perfusion images (time intensity curve) the tumo\\nr shows slow enhancement, starting approximately 20 seconds post arterial enhancement. \\nThis is an enchondroma and needs no follow up.

              " Document(page_content='As for 18F-FDG-PET-CT, SUVmax was shown to correlate with\\nhistologic grade in chondroid tumors. \\nSUVmax < 2 supports the diagnosis of a benign\\ntumor, while SUVmax > 4.5 is suggestive of higher grade\\nchondrosarcoma. \\nHowever, as the majority of ACT/grade\\nI lesions ends up in an intermediate category with overlapping values (SUVmax 2- 4.5), PET CT is not recommended\\nto differentiate cartilage tumors. Whole body PET CT may be useful in detecting metastases in\\ndedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. Image\\nDedifferentiated chondrosarcoma in the right femur (arrowhead) with multiple metastases.\\nEnchondroma:\\nEnchondromas are considered a “cartilage rest”.\\nHence the close relation to the epiphyseal growth plate, often within 2 cm. \\nEnchondromas are mostly found in the proximal humerus, distal femur or proximal tibia metaphyses.\\nThese benign lesions occur as incidental findings in 3% of all knee MRIs and need no follow up. \\nEnchondromas may slowly grow over time or even regress in size.\\nGrowth itself is not a sign that the lesion has become malignant. Enchondromas are typically smaller than 5 cm and 80% of enchondromas in the long bones is smaller than 2 cm.\\nVariable size cut offs are proposed to differentiate enchondroma from ACT and chondrosarcomas.\\nIn the BACTIP-criteria a cut off of 4 cm is used to decide whether a lesion should be followed up or not. In our institution we use 5\\ncm as a cut off, however keep in mind that there is no definitive size cutoff\\nvalue and you should always rule out aggressive features, since there can be\\nhigh grade chondrosarcomas smaller than 5 cm that grow through the cortex and\\nhave an accompanying soft tissue mass.

This has implications for\\nradiologists too, as the main task is now to decide which lesions we want to\\nfollow up. In our tertiary referral centre, we\\nfollow up lesions that extend up to the cortex.

Since the paradigm has shifted, more and mo\\nre centers treat ACTs with watchful waiting and no operation. \\nActively look for features such as perilesional bone marrow oedema, periosteal reaction, cortical destruction and a soft tissue mass to call a tumor high grade CS. Bone expansion ma\\ny be seen in ACT but is more common in high grade CS. \\nMucoid components are a sign of higher grade and are also present for example in dedifferentiated CS.\\nFast dynamic contrast enhancement, cortical scalloping and matrix calcifications can be present in both ACTs and high grade CS so these features do not differentiate the two.\\nSize matters but is not a key feature to differentiate ACT from high grade CS.\\nIn case of a pathological fracture in ACT, surrounding oedema and periostitis may be present.

In case of highly aggressive tumors, other primary b\\none tumors such as Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma may enter the differential diagnosis.\\nEspecially the rare subtype osteolytic osteosarcoma or chondroblastic osteosarcoma can be difficult to distinguish from chondroid tumors. \\nIn case of doubt, a biopsy for pathology diagnosis needs to be obtained, as there are important consequences for treatment (such as chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients). \\nIn patients over 50 years of age, the differential diagnosis includes metastasis and plasmacytoma. Bone infarctions Bone infarction\\nThe most common differential diagnosis for matrix mineralization in the metaphysis of a long bone is a bone infarction. These calcifications appear more squared than rounded such as\\n in cartilage tumors.\\nIn addition, bone infarctions are often multifocal and may occur bilaterally. ImageRadiograph demonstrates multiple serpiginous sclerotic lesions in the distal femur and proximal ti\\nbia, centered on the metaphysis.\\nThis image is typical for bone infarctions and occurred due to longstanding steroid use in a patient with SLE.\\nNote the absence of stippled chondroid calcifications. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia Fibrous dysplasia\\nIn the differential diagnosis we can consider fibrous dysplasia, which often contains a cartilage component.\\nIn most cases the ground glass appearance on radiographs helps to differentiate. First look at the images of a 23-year-old male with a history of pubertas praecox (early puberty). T\\nhen continue reading. HipThere is expansion of the proximal femur with widening of the metaphysis and a ground glass osteolytic lesion with sclerotic margins in the medullary cavity\\n. Note the secondary osteoarthritis of the hip.\\nWristThe distal radius shows the same appearance with a changed bone structure due to ground glass osteolytic lesions with expansion.

The argument was that such lesions,\\nespecially in the long bones, behave in a locally aggressive manner and do not\\nmetastasize. Therefore, they should not be classiﬁed as having full malignant potential\\n(1). In the 2020 WHO edition the term ACT\\nis only reserved for low-grade chondrosarcomas located within the long bones of\\nthe appendicular skeleton. The term “CS1”should be reserved for tumors of the\\naxial skeleton, including the pelvis, ribs, scapula and skull base (ﬂat\\nbones), reﬂecting\\nthe poorer clinical outcome of these tumors at these sites. Primary central ACTs arise in the medulla of long bones without a benign\\nprecursor.\\nSecondary central ACTs arise centrally in bone in association with a\\npreexisting enchondroma.\\nPeripheral ACTs in long bones arise secondary within the cartilaginous\\ncap of a preexisting osteochondroma.\\nThe WHO 2020 defined a cut-off of 2 cm\\nfor the cartilage cap thickness.

In this era of rapidly changing management of breast ca\\nncer, it is important to be familiar with the staging classification and be aware of the available surgical, radiotherapeutic and oncological management options in order to provide \\nrelevant information and so optimize patient care This article is an overview of breast cancer staging and treatment. Keep in mind there are local differences in treatment strategie\\ns, and that new targeted therapies are currently being developed.\\nOverview:\\nClick to enlarge\\nStaging and treatment overview 1:\\nThis is a schematic illustration of the staging and treatment in a patient with breast cancer. This results in a pTNM-stage. After neoadjuvant therapy the letter y is added, and it \\nis referred to as the ypTNMstage.\\n4. Based on the pTNM- or ypTNM-stage, further treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal or HER-2 targeted therapy is discussed in the multidisciplinary team. E\\nvery image can be clicked to enlarge.\\nStaging and treatment overview 2:\\nThis table demonstrates the staging and treatment of breastcancer in a more schematic way. cTNM Breast cancer is first clinically staged. The cTNM describes the local involvement of\\n the breast (T), regional lymph nodes (N) and systemic disease, i.e. distant metastases (M). Systemic disease (or stage 4 disease) is not included in the table. This results in the \\npossible diagnoses of DCIS, localized cancer, locoregionally advanced cancer and cancer with distant metastases. The term 'clinical' in clinical TNM-stage may be somewhat confusing.\\n One might think that this staging is largely based on the findings of physical examination, but it is mostly based on the results of imaging and image-guided biopsy. Neoadjuvant ch\\nemotherapy Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (from neo: before and adjuvare: to aid) is given to patients with locoregionally advanced cancer to decrease the tumor burden prior to surgery. I\\nn patients with localized cancer in whom there is an indication for adjuvant therapy (see table under adjuvant therapy), the therapy may be given before surgery (neo-adjuvant) or af\\nter surgery (adjuvant). Sentinel Node In patients who have no detectable axillary lymph node metastases with ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA), a sentinel node procedur\\ne is performed in order to acquire information about the lymph node status of the axilla. Breast Conserving Therapy or Mastectomy BCT is performed when excision is possible with goo\\nd cosmetic result. Surgery is always followed by radiotherapy. Good cosmetic result depends on the size of the tumor and the size of the breast. Nowadays it is possible to treat lar\\nger tumors with BCT by applying plastic- and reconstructive surgery with fat grafting and flap-procedures. If BCT is not possible - or wanted by the patient - a mastectomy is perfor\\nmed. Radiotherapy Treatment is planned on the final stage and tumor characteristics. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are complementary treatment options after p\\nrimary locoregional treatment. These are aimed at eliminating any distant occult metastases which may be present, but cannot be detected yet. Adjuvant therapy can consist of chemoth\\nerapy and/or herceptin and/or hormonal therapy. The choice of therapy depends on:\\nDCIS:\\nThere are multiple fine, linear calcifications in a large segment of the breast. These are suspicious calcifications and are typically seen in DCIS. Click to enlarge Ductal carcinom\\na in situ is the most common non-invasive breast cancer. In situ means 'in place' and refers to the fact that the cancer has not moved out of the duct and does not infiltrate the su\\nrrounding tissue. DCIS can progress to become invasive cancer, but likelihood estimates vary. 80% of DCIS is diagnosed on mammography alone on the basis of microcalcifications (figu\\nre), followed by vacuum-assisted biopsy. Very few cases of DCIS present as a palpable mass. The problem with DCIS is: Because of these problems, a pre-operative MRI is performed in \\ncases with high-grade DCIS in some institutions, to better delineate the spread of the tumor and to assess if there are any signs of invasive growth. Whether this is of benefit to t\\nhe patient is still unclear. Treatment of DCIS consists of breast conserving therapy (BCT) or mastectomy depending on whether excision is possible with good cosmetic result, and of \\ncourse, on patient preference. BCT consists of microscopically complete tumor excision and radiotherapy. A radiation boost may be considered, particularly in younger patients. Senti\\nnel node procedure should be considered in patients likely to have additional invasive carcinoma (see table). SpecimenIf the DCIS is completely resected, this is called an R0-resect\\nion. After breast conserving surgery, these patients are treated with radiotherapy. If there is focal invasion of the resection margins, an extra boost is given. If there is more th\\nan focal invasion (> 4mm) then a re-resection or mastectomy will be performed. Click to enlarge Study the images and then continue reading. Click image to enlarge. The findings are:\\n Because of the large area with calcifications, a mastectomy was planned. A sentinel node procedure was also performed because of the estimated size of the DCIS. Whenever a mastecto\\nmy is planned, an SN-procedure is routinely included, because it cannot be performed afterwards. Pathology showed small foci of invasive cancer. Click to enlarge In this patient, th\\nere are two groups of suspicious calcifications which are about 5 cm apart. First the larger group was biopsied. The idea was that if these calcifications were benign, then the smal\\nler cluster would probably also be benign. However, the larger group of calcifications turned out to be DCIS grade 2. So a second biopsy was needed of the smaller group of calcifica\\ntions, and this also turned out to be DCIS grade 2. A mastectomy with a sentinel node procedure was planned. The total area of DCIS was thought to be too large for breast conserving\\n treatment.\\nLocalized breast cancer:\\nLocalized or early stage breast cancer includes: Axilla The axilla is initially examined with ultrasound. When pathologic lymph nodes are detected, the next step is FNA. If the resu\\nlts are positive (N+), usually a PET-CT is performed to exclude more advanced disease. When no suspicious lymph nodes are found with ultrasound (N), the next step is a sentinel node\\n procedure. BCT in Localized breast cancer When breast conserving surgery is performed, there is always a risk of leaving small areas of tumor behind - even when the resection margi\\nns are tumor-free. This is the main reason why in BCT, surgery is always combined with radiotherapy. The risk of local recurrence is greater in tumors surrounded by an extensive DCI\\nS component. Depending on the receptor status of the tumor, most patients with localized cancer will also receive adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. Only older patients (>70y) or pa\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 354}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"tients younger than 70 years with small, low-grade tumors do not need chemotherapy (see table). No further investigations are necessary in localized breast cancer, because the chanc\\ne of finding metastatic disease is very low.\\nLocoregional advanced cancer:\\nLocally advanced breast cancer includes: Treatment In the past these tumors were synonymous with inoperable breast cancer, but this has changed after the introduction of neoadjuvant\\n therapy. These patients are first treated with neoadjuvant chemo- and/or hormonal therapy. If there is a good response to the neoadjuvant therapy, the next step is surgery and some\\ntimes even breast-conserving surgery is possible. Before neoadjuvant therapy is given, a clip is placed in the tumor. Sometimes the response is so good that no residual tumor can be\\n found. There is current debate whether these patients still need surgery, but currently, most of these patients are treated with BCT (lumpectomy centered on the clip, followed by r\\nadiotherapy ).\\nSurgery and other procedures:\\nFNA of axillary lymph nodesThe criteria for performing Ultrasound guided FNA or biopsy of an axillary lymph node are:\\nWire localisation:\\nDCIS and many small tumors are not palpable. In these cases, the radiologist places a hook wire in the area that needs to be removed. The wire is placed within the tumor or the area\\n of DCIS, either US-guided or stereotactically. With US, the position of the tumor is marked on the skin, while the patient holds her arm in the same position as during surgery. The\\n exact depth of the tumor beneath the skin is also noted. The figure shows the tract of the wire (yellow arrows) towards the tumor (red arrow). Notice the black dot on the skin to m\\nark the exact position of the tumor. The curved arrow indicates the entrance of the wire into the breast.\\nSentinel node:\\nThe sentinel node procedure (SLN) has become the standard method for staging the axilla in breast cancer patients with a negative axillary ultrasound (cN-). SLN biopsy provides accu\\nrate staging information while avoiding the morbidity of a complete axillary lymph node dissection. A radiopharmacon together with a dye is injected in or near the tumor (figure). T\\nhese tracers flow through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node(s) to receive the tracers are removed. Usually about three nodes are removed. Removal of more than\\n three SLNs does not increase the accuracy of finding a positive node.\\nBCT:\\nBreast Conserving Treatment (BCT) is also known as lumpectomy or wide excision. A locoregional excision of the tumor is combined with a sentinel node procedure for axillary node sta\\nging, followed by radiotherapy of the breast with or without a boost. MRI-compatible clips should be placed in the tumor bed for the purpose of obtaining accuracy in radiotherapy. R\\ne-excision is indicated if there is more than a focal tumor-positive resection margin (see pathology). Resection margins in BCT No tumor in the resection margin.\\n* Focal non-radical Less than 4mm of the resection margin contains tumor.\\n* More than focal More than 4mm of the margin is involved. Invasive cancerRe-excision is indicated if there is a more than focal tumor-positive resection margin, as this is the most\\n important risk factor for local recurrence. When the resection margin is only focally involved, adjusting the radiation dose appears to be a good alternative to re-excision. DCISTr\\neatment is more aggressive in DCIS, since re-excision or mastectomy is advocated in any involvement of the resection margins.\\nMastectomy:\\nSimple MastectomyRemoval of the whole breast. Some of the axillary lymph nodes (level I) may also be removed. Modified radical mastectomyThe breast, most or all of the axillary lymp\\nh nodes, and the fascia of the chest wall muscles is removed. The pectoralis muscle is not removed. Nipple sparing mastectomy In most cases the nipple is removed in a mastectomy. Th\\ne nipple can be spared if: DIEP flap\\nOncoplastic surgery:\\nDirect reconstructionDirect breast reconstruction using implants. DIEP-flapThe deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap is a common technique in which skin and subcuta\\nneous fat are taken from the abdomen to recreate the breast. SGAP flapThe superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) flap uses tissue from the top of the buttocks to create breast ti\\nssue. This is usually done if patients do not have adequate skin and tissue in their abdomens or have had previous abdominal surgeries. TRAM flap In a pedicle TRAM flap, the tissue \\nremains attached to its original site, retaining its blood supply. The flap, consisting of the skin, fat, and muscle with its blood supply, is tunneled beneath the skin to the chest\\n.\\nAxillary Lymph Node Dissection:\\nIn Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) the axillary lymph nodes are removed. There are three levels of axillary lymph nodes: Level I is below the lower edge of the pectoralis mino\\nr muscle. Level II is at the level of the pectoralis minor. Level III is above the pectoralis minor. In ALND levels I and II are removed. Nowadays, surgeons try to avoid an ALND by \\nperforming a sentinel node dissection or by downstaging the axilla with neoadjuvant therapy. ALND is performed when there are many positive nodes or when neoadjuvant therapy is not \\npossible. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\\nMARI procedure:\\nThe MARI procedure is a new minimal invasive method to assess the pathological response of an axillary lymph node metastasis after neoadjuvant systemic treatment. The tumor-positive\\n axillary lymph node is marked with a radioactive iodine (I) seed. This marked lymph node is the so-called MARI-node. After neoadjuvant treatment, the MARI node is selectively remov\\ned using a γ-detection probe. If the node has become tumor-negative and the sentinel node is also negative, no additional treatment of the axilla is necessary. This method allows ax\\nilla-conserving surgery in patients who respond well to neoadjuvant treatment.\\nPathology:\\npTNM-stage:\\nFollowing surgery, the surgical specimens of the tumor, the sentinel node or axillary nodes after dissection are analyzed by the pathologist. This results in a pTNM-stage (table). T\\nhe pTNM may differ from the cTNM-stage, and sometimes the original treatment plan has to be adjusted. For example, if the margins of a resected specimen are not tumor-free, re-excis\\nion or adjustment of radiotherapy may be necessary. For a proper pathological pT-classification there can be no gross tumor in the resection margins. Classification is possible with\\n microscopic tumor in the margins. The tumor size includes only the invasive component. If there is a large in situ component (e.g. 4 cm) and a small invasive component (e.g. 0,5 cm\\n), the tumor is measured 0,5 cm and coded pT1a. The analysis of the surgical specimen of the tumor, the sentinel node or axillary nodes after dissection by the pathologist results i\\nn a pTNM or ypTNM-stage. Other tumor characteristics such as tumor-grade, hormone receptors, lymphangio-invasion and gene-expression are also examined, as these characteristics also\\n determine the risk of local recurrence and systemic disease.\\npN-stage:\\nypN-stage In patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the lymph node status will be affected. For this reason, a y is added to the pN-stage. For instance, if a sentinel \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 355}),\n",

Tumor-grading The histological grade of a tumor is an\\nother important prognostic factor in the staging of a tumor. A high-grade tumor is more likely to spread, necessitating more aggressive adjuvant therapy. Tumor grading is done accor\\nding to the modified Bloom and Richardson guidelines and is based on the total score of tubule formation, nuclear polymorphism and mitotic activity.\\nGene expression:\\nThe prognosis and treatment of patients with breast cancer depends on many factors: Analysis of the DNA of the tumor and the gene expression has led to the identification of subtype\\ns of breast cancer that have distinct clinical outcomes and different responses to chemotherapy. It can help to select patients that need to be treated aggressively and who don't. G\\nene expression is a process in which a gene gets turned on in a cell to make RNA and proteins. Some of these proteins, such as HER2/neu, stimulate the growth of tumor cells. HER2/ne\\nu This protein is produced in abnormally high amounts in about 20% of breast tumors. Breast cancers that overproduce HER2 tend to be more aggressive and are more likely to recur. Tr\\nastuzumab (Herceptin) targets the HER2 protein specifically, and in conjunction with adjuvant chemotherapy, can lower the risk of recurrence by about 50% when compared with chemothe\\nrapy alone. Whenever breast cancer recurs or spreads, the cancer cells should be retested for HER2 as well as for hormone receptor status, as these may differ from the original canc\\ner in up to 20 to 30 percent of cases (8). Mammaprint On the basis of patterns of gene expression, breast cancer may be subdivided into different molecular subtypes or profiles. One\\n of these profiles is the MammaPrint®, which tests for 70 different tumor genes and divides patients into a high- and low-risk category and whether patients will benefit from chemot\\nherapy or not.\\nSystemic Therapy:\\n* Some advocate chemotherapy in all HER2+ patients younger than 35 years\\nAdjuvant systemic therapy:\\nAdjuvant systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are administered as complements to primary locoregional treatment with the aim of eliminating any distant occult metastases (whi\\nch may be present, but cannot be detected yet). Adjuvant therapy can consist of chemotherapy, herceptin and/or hormonal therapy. Herceptin as added to chemotherapy in patients who a\\nre HER2/neu positive and hormonal therapy is given to patients who have estrogen or progesteron receptors (ER+ or PR+) In older women who are ER+ or PR+ sometimes only hormonal ther\\napy ois given in trying to stabalize the disease.\\nNeoadjuvant therapy:\\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy or primary systemic treatment used to be given exclusively to patients with locally advanced disease, i.e. stage III and stage II-patients with a large tumo\\nr (T3N0). Current policy is that more and more patients with early cancer, who have an indication for chemotherapy, are also being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead of a\\ndjuvant therapy post-surgery. Advantages of this policy is that neoadjuvant therapy allows for monitoring of the response to treatment, so that the type of chemotherapy can be adjus\\nted when there is no adequate response. Another advantage is that the size of the lumpectomy can be reduced, and breast conserving treatment may be possible in patients who would ot\\nherwise have been treated with mastectomy. Even in clinical complete remission, a combination of surgery and radiotherapy was found necessary to avoid local recurrence. Precondition\\ns for starting neoadjuvant therapy Breast diagnostics Regional diagnostics Screening for distant metastasis\\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy:\\nThe response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is 80-90%. The risk of progression is less than 5-10%. There is no clear treatment plan in case of progression, which is defined as REC\\nIST > 20% increase in diameter during chemotherapy.\\nNeoadjuvant hormonal therapy:\\nThere are no randomized studies available comparing neoadjuvant hormonal therapy with the same treatment postoperatively. Similar to chemotherapy, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy appea\\nrs to make downstaging possible for hormone receptor-positive tumors, with an improved chance of radical surgery in stage III or BCT when mastectomy initially seemed necessary.\\nNeoadjuvant trastuzumab:\\nThe addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases the percentage of pathological complete response.\\nRadiotherapy:\\nRadiotherapy of the breast Radiotherapy forms an integral part of breast conserving treatment in breast cancer. Most recurrences after BCT are due to growth of residual tumor. The w\\nhole breast is irradiated with an optional boost dose to the tumor bed. Patients with a small and low grade DCIS have a low risk of recurrence and additional radiotherapy may not be\\n justified (15). Radiotherapy of the chest wall Indications for radiotherapy of the chest wall following mastectomy are: Radiotherapy of the axilla Axillary radiotherapy is a safe a\\nlternative to axillary lymph node surgery and has a less risk of lymphedema. There is a lot of discussion concerning the indications for radiotherapy of the axilla. Many guidelines \\nare not evidence-based. Approaches differ between countries and between institutions. In the Duthc Breast Cancer Guideline 2012 the indications are as follows (1): Radiotherapy is n\\not recommended.\\n2. Micrometastases in the SN: Radiotherapy is only recommended in case of additional risk factors.\\n3. Macrometastases: Radiotherapy is indicated. In cases with a large axillary tumor load an axillary lymph node dissection is recommended. These guidelines however do not apply to o\\nther countries and are also not evidence-based, but expert opinions. You must reach a consensus for radiotherapy indications in your own institution.\\nSpecial types of breast cancer:\\nTriple negative breast cancer:\\nApproximately 15-20% of breast cancers are so-called triple negative and characterized by the absence of ER-, PR- and HER2-overexpression. These tumors occur more often at a young a\\nge, are high-grade, and on presentation often substantial in size with metastases to the axillary lymph nodes. Triple negative tumors have a poorer prognosis with rapid recurrences,\\n and frequent brain metastases. Studies have found that these tumors respond better to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines and taxanes compared to other tumor type\\ns.\\nInflammatory carcinoma:\\nInflammatory carcinoma or mastitis carcinomatosa is a separate category of breast cancer and accounts for 1-5% of all breast cancers. It is characterized by diffuse redness, peau d'\\norange and swelling of the breast, therefore it is mainly a clinical diagnosis. It is a rare and very aggressive disease in which tumor emboli block the lymphatics in the skin. The \\nTNM classification is T4D (stage III). Dimpling of the skin and nipple retraction is not the same as inflammatory breast cancer and may occur in any T-stage without affecting the cl\\nassification.\\nPaget disease of the nipple:\\nThe diagnosis of Paget disease of the nipple can only be made if there is no disease in the underlying breast parenchyma. Carcinomas in the breast parenchyma associated with Paget d\\nisease are categorized based on the size and characteristics of the parenchymal disease, although the presence of Paget disease should still be noted.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 356}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Lobular carcinoma:\\nInvasive lobular carcinoma is the second most common type of breast cancer after invasive ductal carcinoma (17). Invasive lobular carcinomas tend to be more difficult to detect on m\\nammography, because instead of forming a lump, the cancer cells typically spread to the surrounding connective tissue in a line formation.\\nAdditional Imaging:\\nPET-CT:\\nWhen to use PET-CT PET-CT is recommended in patients with locoregional disease to search for distant metastases. PET-CT has a higher sensitivity and specificity for the detection of\\n distant metastases and locoregional recurrence than conventional imaging. The sensitivity of PET-CT however is too low for the detection of a primary breast cancer and PET-CT also \\ndoes not play a role in staging of a clinically negative axilla and cannot replace the SN-procedure. However, when axillary lymph node metastases are detected by FNA or sentinel nod\\ne procedure, and the PET-CT shows uptake in lymph nodes, then all these nodes are regarded as positive, because the positive predictive value is high. Here an example of a patient w\\nith advanced breast cancer. The US of the breast showed an 18mm echopoor lesion with irregular margins and microcalcifications. US of the axilla revealed a lymph node with no fatty \\nhilum. FNA was performed, and both the tumor and the lymph node were positive for adenocarcinoma. The lesion was clinically staged as cT1N+. A PET-CT was performed. On the upper PET\\n-CT image a level II node is positive just underneath the pectoralis minor (yellow arrow). Multiple axillary nodes were found but no systemic metastases. Normal brown fat is seen al\\nong the neck and shoulder muscles on both sides (circle). This patient was planned for neoadjuvant therapy and biopsies were taken for the determination of the tumor grade, hormone \\nreceptors and HER-2-neu-amplification. Here another PET-CT example. On the mammogram, there is a tumor with secondary skin retraction. Notice multiple linear calcifications within t\\nhe tumor - click on image to enlarge. This means that the infiltrating tumor developed within an area of ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS. Ultrasound demonstrates tumorfoci within t\\nhe skin, i.e. T4b (red arrow). Continue... On this ultrasound image, there is another satellite nodule within the skin (yellow arrow). Multiple enlarged axillary nodes are seen (red\\n arrow). Fine needle aspiration demonstrated metastases within these nodes. This tumor was staged as T4bN+. This means that we are dealing with locoregionally advanced disease. Thes\\ne patients are at risk for systemic disease and additional imaging was performed. Continue... Here we see the PET-CT image of this patient. Both the breast carcinoma as well as the \\nspread to the skin are demonstrated (red arrows). There are multiple metastases in both lungs - a metastasis in the right lung is indicated by yellow arrow; notice the larger metast\\nasis in the left lung. In addition, there were also bone- and liver metastases and multiple axillary lymph nodes were seen (not shown on this image). The cTNM-stage of the tumor is \\nT4bN3M1.\\nMRI:\\nMRI is found to be better at indicating the size of DCIS and invasive cancer and is also better in detecting multifocal or contralateral disease. There is still debate concerning th\\ne role of preoperative MRI in patients with breast cancer, because overestimation occurs due to the presence of enhancing benign proliferative disorders. Many do not recommend a pre\\noperative MRI, since it has not resulted in a better outcome or significantly lower percentage of reoperations. It is only recommended in high grade DCIS with indeterminate tumor si\\nze in patients who would like to be eligible for BCT. MRI however plays an important role in diagnostic problem solving and in the screening of high-risk patients. A large tumor in \\nthe right breast is easily detected with BSGI, while hardly visible on the mammogram.\\nBSGI:\\nBreast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) is an adjunct modality for breast imaging which, like MRI, uses a physiologic approach to identify lesions in the breast. The sensitivity and sp\\necificity are comparable to MRI, and are much higher than for mammography - especially in dense breast tissue. The higher radiation dose compared to mammography makes BSGI unsuitabl\\ne for screening, but it is an excellent tool for problem-solving. Just like MRI, it is good at detecting multifocal or contralateral disease. by Sharon H. Giordano The Oncologist De\\ncember 2003 vol. 8no. 6 521-530\\n6.

However, there are more organs within the female pelvis\\nin reach of the transvaginal probe such as the bladder, urethra, distal ureters, sigmoid,\\nanorectum and the appendix. \\nAlso the virtual spaces of the peritoneal cavity as\\ncavum Retzii and Douglas pouch can be inspected. Due to the high mobility of\\nthe vaginal top, pathology of these organs and regions can be studied by TVUS\\nwith a high frequency probe, resulting in exceptionally detailed images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Normal US anatomy Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Normal US anatomy Uterus and ovaries are best visualized with a half-full\\nbladder. A very full bladder is unpleasant for the patient, hinders adequate compression and pushes organs\\naway from the ventral abdominal wall, out of reach for transabdominal US. In the sagittal view, uterus, cervix, vagina, anorectum\\nand urethra (u.) can be identified, as well as the collapsed anterior and\\nposterior fornix of the vagina. Studying  the\\nuterus in retroflexion, usually requires more bladder filling.

It is important to understand also the anatomy outside\\nthe uterus. \\nA little fluid in Douglas’ pouch and a small Nabothian cyst (n.) may\\nbe easy to identify, but what are the structures marked with a question mark? Note\\nthe full bladder displacing the uterus posteriorly.. Probe orientation in TVUS It is important to realize that the orientation of the\\nendovaginal probe is different from that of the abdominal probe. The right\\npanel shows the anteflexed uterus visualized with the endovaginal probe in the\\nanterior fornix of the vagina. This position of the uterus corresponds with the\\nimage during transabdominal US. Probe orientation in TVUS Most sonographers, however,  look at the TVUS image rotated 90  degrees anti-clockwise, as in the right\\npanel. This is not necessarily a problem, as long as one realizes the different\\npresentation of the anatomy, including gravity effects. Note the horizon in\\nrelation to the TVUS image. Fluid-debris-level in endometriotic cyst For instance, in this patient with an endometriotic cyst\\nthe fluid-debris-level is vertically oriented, and could therefore be misinterpreted. This could be overcome by clockwise rotating the US image 90 degrees (right\\nimage). The importance of orientation in pattern recognition. However, liberal switching of US image orientation does\\nnot favour good pattern recognition. For this reason, it is best to stick to one\\nand the same orientation. For example, many radiologists reading a CT\\ncolonography, made with the patient in prone position, will switch to the familiar\\nCT image in “supine” position, especially when searching for extra-colonic\\npathology. Likewise,  although the image information of the two Mr.\\nBean portraits is identical, the comedian is much easier recognized on the\\npicture hanging normal than on the one hanging upside-down.\\nTVUS for Urological Pathology:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nUreteral stones:\\nIn pregnant patients with suspected ureterolithiasis, CT  is contra-indicated.

DIE, if localized in Douglas pouch and the\\nvesico-uterine recess, may aggressively invade the rectum, bladder and ureters,\\nwith all its sequelae, as colonic obstruction, micturition problems and hydronephrosis. In prominent, longstanding DIE, the resulting bulky\\nscar tissue of DIE (*), may cause narrowing, and eventually total obstruction, of\\nthe colonic lumen. In this young lady with unexplained chronic abdominal\\nsymptoms for many years, CT and subsequent MRI demonstrated extensive endometriosis. In addition there are large, adhesive endometriotic cysts\\n(“kissing ovaries”),   bilateral hydronephrosis and complete\\nobstruction of the colon, due to ingrowth of endometriosis in the ureters and the rectum.\\nBackground:\\nThere are many reasons for diagnostic delay in\\nDIE.\\nThe symptoms of DIE are chronic, atypical and often non-cyclical.\\nGynaecological\\nTVUS often shows a normal uterus and normal ovaries.\\nThe lab findings are usually\\nnormal and colonoscopy in DIE is often inconclusive Even laparoscopy can be non-diagnostic\\nbecause DIE may hide under adhesions. MRI of DIE (*) yields pathognomonic images, but is\\nonly performed when there is clinical suspicion of endometriosis. TVUS provides a unique opportunity to make the diagnosis\\nof DIE in patients who undergo routine examination for aspecific symptoms.\\nDIE of the rectum:\\nThe images are of a patient with DIE and a normal aspect of uterus and\\novaries. DIE has typical, almost pathognomonic TVUS features. \\nAlthough\\nobviously a gynaecological condition, it is not infrequently overlooked by\\ngynaecologists during TVUS. The reason is that the majority of\\npatients with DIE (*), lack the typical endometriotic cysts and have, as in the\\npatient here, a normal uterus and ovaries (L. OV. and R. OV.). Furthermore, the\\nTVUS diagnosis of DIE requires thorough knowledge of the US image of normal and\\npathological bowel and bladder, which knowledge may be absent in gynaecologists. (See also: “US of the GI tract: normal anatomy”) DIE implants on the outer surface of the colon in f\\nour\\ndifferent patients. DIE implants (*) in Douglas pouch, are asymmetrically\\nlocalized, solid, hypoechoic, poorly vascularized masses, which are continuous\\nwith the outer hypoechoic muscularis layer of the colon. The overlying hyperechoic submucosa,  and also the colonic mucosa are generally intact.\\nThis explains also why blood in the stool is quite rare in DIE. The outer contour of these hypoechoic masses is mostly\\nfirmly adherent to uterus and/or cervix. Often there is spiculation or “tethering”\\nvisible on the outer margins. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Adherence to the uterus and cervix can be demonstrated by gently pushing with the probe to-and-fro\\n. Whereas the normal sigmoid and rectum can easily be pushed away from the uterus with the probe (“sliding phenomenon”), the adhesions (arrow) belonging to DIE (*) block the entranc\\ne of the probe into the posterior fornix. In this videoclip, the transvaginal probe is gently\\nmoved to-and-fro. The implant (*) has developed firm adhesions between uterus\\nand colon, which prevent entering of the probe deeper in the direction of the\\nsacrum. In the normal situation, uterus and colon can be easily be pushed aside. TVUS image of DIE with operative specimen.

Image orientation in TVUS and MRI For a proper understanding of the TVUS image of DIE\\nand especially the correlation with the MRI images, it is important to realize the\\ndifferent orientations used in both image modalities. In the upper three rows, the “MRI-orientation”\\nprevails, and the upper-right TVUS image is therefore is 1. flipped\\nhorizontally (mirror view) and 2. rotated anti-clockwise about 120 degrees.

Both conditions appear as solid, moderately defined, rather\\nhypoechoic, asymmetrically localized masses arising from the rectum with a\\ntendency to narrow the lumen. TVUS may be key to discriminate the two. In DIE the hypoechoic mass is hypovascular, it is localized\\nat the outer contour of the rectum and is continuous with the hypoechoic muscularis.\\nThe submucosa and mucosa of the colon are intact. In rectal CA, the hypoechoic mass is hypervascular and\\nthe mass originates from the mucosa, with focal loss of layer structure as a\\nconsequence of transmural tumour growth.

We wil discuss disc herniation, facet art\\nhrosis, synovial cysts, spondylolisthesis and epidural lipomatosis. The images can be enlarged by clicking on them.\\nSystematic approach:\\nFour levels of nerve compression:\\nIn patients with symptoms of nerve root compression, there are four levels that need to be studied: This is the most common area where nerves are compressed. Mostly by herniated dis\\ncs and less frequently due to spinal stenosis.\\n2. Level of lateral recess. This is the area below the disc where the nerve runs more laterally towards the foramen. Narrowing of the lateral recess is caused by facet arthrosis, us\\nually in combination with hypertrophy of the flavum ligament and bulging of the disc.\\n3. Foramen. This is the area between two pedicles, where the nerve leaves the spinal canal. Narrowing of the foramen is seen in facet arthrosis, spondylolisthesis and foraminal disc\\n herniation - usually a migrated disc from a lower level.\\n4. Extra-foraminal. This is the area lateral to the foramen. Nerve compression in this area is uncommon, but is sometimes caused by a laterally herniated disc. At these four levels \\nthere can be a lot of overlap of pathology. For instance a herniated disc can cause nerve compression at the level of the disc, but also at the level of the foramen or extra-foramin\\nal when there is migration of the disc. When you are looking for nerve compression, you have to study all these levels. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images to see how the nerves run at the level of the disc, lateral recess, foramen and extra-foraminal. At each level specific pathology can be see\\nn, but there is a lot of overlap. For instance a disc can herniate and cause nerve compression at the level of the disc, but can also migrate to a lower level and compress the nerve\\n in the lateral recess or move upward and cause compression at the level of the foramen or extra-foraminal. In patients with facet arthrosis the bony spurs can move medially and nar\\nrow the lateral recess or move upward and narrow the foramen. When there is extreme facet arthrosis bilaterally, it can cause stenosis of the spinal canal and compress all the nerve\\n roots at that level.\\nAnatomy:\\nThe illustration demonstrates the structures that surround the nerves within the spinal canal. Flavum ligament The flavum ligament is a strong ligament on the interior posterior sid\\ne of the vertebral canal that connects the laminae of adjacent vertebrae. As a result of aging and instability of the vertebral column due to facet arthrosis there will be more stre\\nss on the flavum ligament resulting in hypertrophy and fibrosis. Hypertrophy of the flavum ligament is usually seen in combination with facet arthrosis and both result in stenosis o\\nf the lateral recess or when it is bilateral, in spinal stenosis. Epidural fatThis is the fat that surrounds the dural sac, that contains the nerves. Abundant fat can be seen in ste\\nroid therapy, extreme obesitas and rarely idiopathic. Abundant epidural fat can contribute to stenosis of the spinal canal.\\nMRI protocol:\\nThe MRI protocol for examination of the lumbar spine in patients with symptoms of nerve compression is quite simple. Basically we rely on the sagittal T1W- and T2W-images and correl\\nate the findings with the transverse T2W-images of the levels of suspected pathology. Do not use a saturation band on the anterior side or a rectangular field of view (RFOV), becaus\\ne you also want to image the prevertebral soft tissues. Especially look for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, since this may also be the cause of low back pain. Sometimes it can b\\ne difficult to clinically differentiate neurogenic claudication - which is caused by spinal stenosis - from vascular claudication - which is caused by arterial stenosis. The frequen\\ncy-encoding should be in the AP-direction and consequently the phase-encoding feet-head. This has several advantages: We want the highest resolution in the AP-direction to look for \\nsmall herniations and delineation of nerve roots.\\n2. When you have the phase encoding in the AP-direction, you get breating artifacts. That is why some use a saturation band or the RFOV. With the frequency-encoding in the AP-direct\\nion you do not have these problems and you do not need a saturation band.\\n3. Frequency encoding in the feet-head direction can result in poor deliniation of the vertebral endplates due to chemical shift artifact when the fat in the vertebral body meets th\\ne water in the disc. This is another reason to use a feet-head phase encoding and an AP frequency encoding. It is better to have continuous slices with the same angulation parallel \\nto the level where nerve compression is suspected. This has the advantage, that you can follow the involved nerve along the four levels of possible compression. When you examine mul\\ntiple levels with different angulation like in the example on the right, you will not be able to follow the whole nerve tract and you will not get the whole picture.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 362}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Interpretation:\\nThe sagittal T1W-images give you the most diagnostic information. Before you start looking for any hernias, first take a good look at the prevertebral tissues and bone marrow.

Use of a marker When you notice an abnormality, it can be helpful to use a marker that corr\\nelates with the same location on the other series. If you enlarge the image, you will see the small yellow cross, which indicates that you are looking at the exact same spot on the \\nother series. Here the L5 nerve on the right is compressed by a synovial cyst, which is the result of facet arthrosis with effusion within the intervertebral joints.\\nPrevertebral tissues:\\nHere a 25 year old patient who presented with low back pain. Notice multiple small masses in the abdomen surrounding the mesenteric vessels and abnormal low signal intensity of the \\nbone marrow. The signal intensity of the discus is a little bit higher compared to the bone marrow (bright discus sign). This examination was the first indication of an abnormality \\nin this patient. This proved to be bone- and lymph node metastases of a carcinoma of the colon. Here another patient with widespread lymphadenopathy in the mesenterium and retroperi\\ntoneum. Here a patient, who presented with severe low back pain. Notice the aortic dissection. Sometimes these aortic abnormalities are incidental findings.\\nDisc herniation:\\nDisc herniation is displacement of disc material like nucleus pulposus, parts of the annulus fibrosus and cartilage, beyond the limits of the intervertebral disc space. It can be fo\\ncal ( < 90º), broad-based ( 90º-180º) or caused by bulging of the disc (> 180º). Protrusion indicates that the distance between the edges of the disc herniation is less than the dis\\ntance between the edges of the base. Extrusion is present when the distance between the edges of the disc material is greater than the distance at the base. Read Spine - Disc Nomenc\\nlature for more information about disc herniation nomenclature. Here a focal protrusion at the L5S1 level. The S1 nerve is compressed (arrow). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings at the different levels 1-4 are: There is also an annular tear (high signal) \\nthrough which the disc herniates (yellow arrow)\\n3. At the level of the lateral recess, there is a focal herniation of disc material compressing the L5 nerve (yellow arrow). This is called an extrusion, because the distance betwee\\nn the edges of the disc material is greater than the distance at the base.\\n4. Compressed L5 nerve (blue arrow) within the lateral recess. The herniated disc has migrated caudally and is seen as an oval structure anterior to the nerve. The herniated disc is\\n uncontained, i.e. not covered by fibers of the annulus. First study the images. Click to enlarge them. Then continue reading. The findings are: Click to enlarge The signal intensit\\ny of a hernia on T1W-images is usually intermediate, while on T2W-images it can be a high signal fresh herniated nucleus pulposus or a somewhat older low signal intensity hernia. He\\nre a herniation with high signal (yellow arrow on transverse images) sliding through the annular tear and compressing the left L5 nerve (blue arrow). Here sagittal T1W-images demons\\ntrating a structure of very low signal intensity at the L4L5 level (arrow) and at the L5S1 level. Continue with the T2W-images. T2W-images Also on the T2W-images the signal intensit\\ny is very low. A CT-scan was performed to see if this could be a calcified herniated disc or some artifact. Continue with the CT-images. The low signal intensity could finally be ex\\nplained by the vacuum phenomena due to nitrogen gas within the herniated disc both on L4L5 (red arrow) and L5S1 level (blue arrow) Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll First scroll through these sagittal T1W-images. What are the findings. Then continue with the next series. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll The most striking finding is a intermediate intensity structure posterior to the L3 vertebra (blue arrow). It has the same signal intensity as the disc. This is a her\\nnia that has migrated cranially compressing the L3 nerve on the right side. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Here another example of disc migration. Notice how the disc herniation at the L3L4 level migrates caudally behind the body of L4. Notice that at the L4L5 level the mi\\ngrated disc simulates a nerve root (green arrow), while in fact the nerve is compressed posteriorly and subsequently moves to the foramen (yellow arrow).\\nLateral recess stenosis:\\nStenosis of the lateral recess is a common problem especially in older patients. The stability of the vertebral column decreases, which results in instability. This results in hyper\\ntrophy of the facet joints and arthrosis, bulging of the disc and more stress on the flavum ligament resulting in hypertrophy. All these mechanisms lead to stenosis of the lateral r\\necess (figure). In advances cases of arthrosis a synovial cyst may form, which contributes to the narrowing. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Here a patient with bilateral facet arthrosis resulting in narrowing of the lateral recess on both sides with nerve compression. Scroll through the images. Enable Scr\\noll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nSynovial cyst:\\nSynovial cysts are frequently seen in combination with facet arthrosis. Mostly they lead to stenosis of the lateral facet. When they are very large they can protrude into the forame\\nn and cause foraminal stenosis. Here a patient with severe arthrosis of the facet joints. Notice that there are many synovial cysts related to the arthrosis (red arrows). At the L5S\\n1 level a large cyst on the right compresses the S1-nerve (yellow arrow). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Here sagittal T2-weighted images of a patient with a synovial cyst, that completely fills the neuroforamen (arrow). Notice that at first glance the foramen looks norm\\nal, but the nerve iseems to be missing. The nerve is compressed by the cyst. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Here we have the axial images of the same patient. Notice the dumbbell configuration of the synovial cyst at the level of the neuroforamen (yellow arrows). Synovial c\\nysts can be easily overlooked. On these T2W-images it looks as if the foramen is normal. Notice that the nerve is missing. In fact the neuroforamen is almost completely filled by th\\ne synovial cyst, which compresses the nerve root against the vertebra (arrows). The nerve can hardly be seen.\\nStenosis of the Spinal Canal:\\nCauses of spinal stenosis: Most common Less common Notice the diffuse narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal. It is best seen on the MR-images, but can already be suspected on the rad\\niograph, because the pedicles are very short. You may have to enlarge the image to appreciate this. On the axial T2W-images you can see, that there is no CSF visible surrounding the\\n nerve roots. This means that there is a severe spinal stenosis. The epidural fat compresses the nerves from posteriorly. Here another example of spinal stenosis. Again on the radio\\ngraph you can suspect congenital narrowing. Usually a small hernia or bulging is enough to cause nerve compression in these patients. On the axial T2W-images a severe spinal stenosi\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 363}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='s is seen. Notice the short pedicles in combination with facet arthrosis and flavum hypertrophy. Here a patient with multiple osseus metastases. At the level of L1L2 this causes spi\\nnal stenosis with compression of the nerves (red arrow). It is not that common for metastases to cause nerve compression at the lumbar level. At the thoracic and cervical level meta\\nstases frequently cause compression because there is not much CSF surrounding the myelum. Fractures can cause stenosis of the spinal canal especially when there is displacement of b\\nony structures like in burst fractures and fractures with rotation and translation. Here a patient with an old burst fracture. There is retropulsion of the posterosuperior fragment \\n(red arrow) compressing the cauda (blue arrow).\\nEpidural lipomatosis:\\nEpidural lipomatosis is excessive amount of fat within the epidural space compressing the thecal sac. Patients present with symptoms of spinal canal stenosis. It is seen in patients\\n with obesity, like in this case and in patients who are treated with steroids. Continue with the axial images of this patient. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the axial images. Notice how the spinal canal is narrowed by the epidural fat. Do not mistake the high signal intensity of the fat for CSF.\\nForaminal stenosis:\\nCauses of Foraminal stenosis: Stenosis of the neuroforamen is usually the result of a combination of upward disc herniation and facet arthrosis. It is also frequently seen in patien\\nts with spondylolisthesis. Spondylolisthesis is a condition in which one vertebra slips forward over the one below it, usually L4 upon L5. The shift results from either spondylolysi\\ns (stress fracture of the pars interarticularis) or facetarthrosis with sliding of the facets. Here a patient with severe facet arthrosis on the right side at the L4L5 level. Enable\\n Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images of a patient with spondylolisthesis. Here a disc herniation with upward migration. By using the marker, you can correlate the abnormality on\\n the T1W-image with the axial T2W-images. On the T2W-image it is more obvious that this is a disc herniation. The lower images are with the marker on. you may have to enlarge the im\\nages to see it. These foraminal disc herniations can be easily overlooked. Notice how subtle the findings are on the axial T2W-images. The herniated disc can be easily mistaken for \\nthe nerve root. The sagittal T1W-image shows the upward migration of the disc. Here a patient with a combination of spondylolysis (arrow), minimal listhesis and disc herniation resu\\nlting in compression of the L3 nerve within the foramen. Here a patient with severe anterolisthesis due to bilateral spondylolysis. The anteroposition in combination with the upward\\n movement of the disc has resulted in severe narrowong of the foramen and nerve compression (yellow arrow). Notice the calcification of the uppper part of the disc (blue arrow).\\nExtraforaminal nerve compression:\\nExtraforaminal nerve compression is seen in about 5% of cases. Almost always it is a lateral disc herniation from a lower level that compresses the extraforaminal part of the nerve.\\n Here an example of a lateral disc herniation that produces compression of the superiorly exiting nerve root and ganglion. Notice the L4 nerve (red arrow), which is being displaced \\nposteriorly by a lateral disc herniation at the L4-5 level (green arrow).\\nNone:\\nNone:\\nImaging in Acute Stroke:\\nMajda Thurnher\\nDepartment of Radiology, Medical University of Vienna:\\nPublicationdate 2008-06-30 This review is based on a presentation given by Majda Thurnher and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. We will discuss the followin\\ng subjects: How to identify patients with tissue at risk for guidance in selecting the appropriate therapy Introduction\\nIntroduction:\\nPenumbra: Occlusion of the MCA with irreversibly affected or dead tissue in black and tissue at risk or penumbra in red. The goal of imaging in a patient with acute stroke is: In th\\nis way we can select patients who are candidates for thrombolytic therapy.\\nCT Early signs of ischemia:\\nCT has the advantage of being available 24 hours a day and is the gold standard for hemorrhage. Hemorrhage on MR images can be quite confusing. On CT 60% of infarcts are seen within\\n 3-6 hrs and virtually all are seen in 24 hours. The overall sensitivity of CT to diagnose stroke is 64% and the specificity is 85%. In the table on the left the early CT-signs of c\\nerebral infarction are listed. MCA infarction: on CT an area of hypoattenuation appearing within six hours is highly specific for irreversible ischemic brain damage.\\nHypo attenuating brain tissue:\\nThe reason we see ischemia on CT is that in ischemia cytotoxic edema develops as a result of failure of the ion-pumps. These fail due to an inadequate supply of ATP. An increase of \\nbrain water content by 1% will result in a CT attenuation decrease of 2.5 HU. On the left a patient with hypoattenuating brain tissue in the right hemisphere. The diagnosis is infar\\nction, because of the location (vascular territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and because of the involvement of gray and white matter, which is also very typical for infarc\\ntion. Hypoattenuation on CT is highly specific for irreversible ischemic brain damage if it is detected within first 6 hours (1). Patients who present with symptoms of stroke and wh\\no demonstrate hypodensity on CT within first six hours were proven to have larger infarct volumes, more severe symptoms, less favorable clinical courses and they even have a higher \\nrisk of hemorrhage. Therefore whenever you see hypodensity in a patient with stroke this means bad news. No hypodensity on CT is a good sign. Obscuration of the lentiform nucleus or\\n blurred basal ganglia\\nObscuration of the lentiform nucleus:\\nObscuration of the lentiform nucleus, also called blurred basal ganglia, is an important sign of infarction. It is seen in middle cerebral artery infarction and is one of the earlie\\nst and most frequently seen signs (2). The basal ganglia are almost always involved in MCA-infarction. Two patients with insular ribbon sign\\nInsular Ribbon sign:\\nThis refers to hypodensity and swelling of the insular cortex. It is a very indicative and subtle early CT-sign of infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. This re\\ngion is very sensitive to ischemia because it is the furthest removed from collateral flow. It has to be differentiated from herpes encephalitis.\\nDense MCA sign:\\nThis is a result of thrombus or embolus in the MCA. On the left a patient with a dense MCA sign. On CT-angiography occlusion of the MCA is visible.\\nHemorrhagic infarcts:\\n15% of MCA infarcts are initially hemorrhagic. Hemorrhage is most easily detected with CT, but it can also be visualized with gradient echo MR-sequences.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 364}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"CTA and CT Perfusion:\\nNormal CTA Once you have diagnosed the infarction, you want to know which vessel is involved by performing a CTA. First look at the images on the left and try to detect the abnormal\\nity. Then continue reading. The findings in this case are very subtle. There is some hypodensity in the insular cortex on the right, which is the area we always look at first. In th\\nis case it is suggestive for infarction, but sometimes in older patients with leukencephalopathy it can be very difficult. A CTA was performed (see next images). Now we feel very co\\nmfortable with the diagnosis of MCA infarction. CT Perfusion (CTP) With CT and MR-diffusion we can get a good impression of the area that is infarcted, but we cannot preclude a larg\\ne ischemic penumbra (tissue at risk). With perfusion studies we monitor the first pass of an iodinated contrast agent bolus through the cerebral vasculature. Perfusion will tell us \\nwhich area is at risk. Approximately 26% of patients will require a perfusion study to come to the proper diagnosis.\\nThe limitation of CT-perfusion is the limited coverage. Studies were performed to compare CT with MRI to see how much time it took to perform all the CT studies that were necessary \\nto come to a diagnosis. It was demonstrated that Plain CT, CTP and CTA can provide comprehensive diagnostic information in less than 15 minutes, provided that you have a good team. \\nIn the case on the left first a non-enhanced CT was performed. If there is hemorrhage, then no further studies are necessary. In this case the CT was normal and a CTP was performed,\\n which demonstrated a perfusion defect. A CTA was subsequently performed and a dissection of the left internal carotid was demonstrated.\\nMRI:\\nOn PD/T2WI and FLAIR infarction is seen as high SI. These sequences detect 80% of infarctions before 24 hours. They may be negative up to 2-4 hours post-ictus! On the left T2WI and \\nFLAIR demonstrating hyperintensity in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Notice the involvement of the lentiform nucleus and insular cortex. High signal on conventional MR\\n-sequences is comparable to hypodensity on CT. It is the result of irreversible injury with cell death. So hyperintensity means BAD news: dead brain. DWI in posterior, anterior and \\nmiddle cerebral infarction\\nDiffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI):\\nDWI is the most sensitive sequence for stroke imaging. DWI is sensitive to restriction of Brownian motion of extracellular water due to imbalance caused by cytotoxic edema. Normally\\n water protons have the ability to diffuse extracellularly and loose signal. High intensity on DWI indicates restriction of the ability of water protons to diffuse extracellularly. \\nFirst look at the images on the left and try to detect the abnormality. Then continue reading. The findings in this case are very subtle. There is some hypodensity and swelling in t\\nhe left frontal region with effacement of sulci compared with the contralateral side. You probably only notice these findings because this is an article about stroke and you would n\\normally read this as 'no infarction'. Now continue with the DWI images of this patient. When we look at the DWI-images it is very easy and you don't have to be an expert radiologist\\n to notice the infarction. This is why DWI is called 'the stroke sequence'. Signal intensities on T2WI and DWI in time (courtesy Dr M. Law) When we compare the findings on T2WI and \\nDWI in time we will notice the following: Pseudo-normalization of DWI in a 2 weeks old posterior infarction. Pseudo-normalization of DWI This occurs between 10-15 days. The case on \\nthe left shows a normal DWI. On T2WI there is may be some subtle hyperintensity in the right occipital lobe in the vascular territory of the posterior cerebral artery. The T1WI afte\\nr the administration of Gadolinium shows gyral enhancement indicating infarction. First it was thought that everything that is bright on DWI is dead tissue. However now there are so\\nme papers suggesting that probably some of it may be potentially reversible damage. If you compare the DWI images in the acute phase with the T2WI in the chronic phase, you will not\\nice that the affected brain volume in DWI is larger compared to the final infarcted area (respectively 62cc and 17cc).\\nPerfusion MR Imaging:\\nPerfusion with MR is comparable to perfusion CT. A compact bolus of Gd-DTPA is delivered through a power injector. Multiple echo-planar images are made with a high temporal resoluti\\non. T2* gradient sequences are used to maximize the susceptibility signal changes. The area with abnormal perfusion can be dead tissue or tissue at risk. Combining the diffusion and\\n perfusion images helps us to define the tissue at risk, i.e. the penumbra. Diffusion in yellow. Perfusion in red. Mismatch in blue is penumbra. On the left we first have a diffusio\\nn image indicating the area with irreversible changes (dead tissue). In the middle there is a large area with hypoperfusion. On the right the diffusion-perfusion mismatch is indicat\\ned in blue. This is the tissue at risk. This is the brain tissue that maybe can be saved with therapy. T2WI and PDWI in a patient with sudden onset of neurological symptoms. On the \\nleft a patient with sudden onset of neurological symptoms.\\nMR was performed 1 hour after onset of symptoms.\\nFirst look at the images on the left and try to detect the abnormality. Then continue reading. These images are normal and we have to continue with DWI.\\nSee next images. DWI and PI On the DWI there is a large area with restricted diffusion in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Notice also the involvement of the basal\\n ganglia. There is a perfect match with the perfusion images, so this patient should not undergo any form of thrombolytic therapy. On the left another MCA infarction. It is clearly \\nvisible on CT (i.e. irreversible changes). There is a match of DWI and Perfusion, so no therapy. On the left another case. The DWI and ADC map is shown. Continue for the perfusion i\\nmages Perfusion images demonstrating large penumbra Now we can see that there is a severe mismatch. Almost the whole left cerebral hemisphere is at risk due to hypoperfusion. This p\\natient is an ideal candidate for therapy. by R von Kummer et al. Radiology 1997, Vol 205, 327-333,\\n2.

Ultraso\\nund is easy to perform, since the posterior arch of the vertebra is not yet ossified, providing a perfect acoustic window. \\nEspecially the lumbosacral part of the spinal canal with the conus medullaris and the cauda equina can be beautifully depicted with a high resolution linear array probe.\\nClassification of Spinal dysraphism:\\nSpina bifida aperta:\\nSpinal dysraphism or spina bifida is a congenital anomaly resulting in a defective closure of the neural arch.\\nIt is classified into open (spina bifida aperta) and closed dysraphism (spina bifida occulta). Open dysraphism presents with a swelling over the back which is noticed at birth and m\\nay contain meninges and CSF, called meningocele or contain parts of the spinal cord or nerves, called myelomeningocele. Ultrasound should not be used to image open spinal dysraphism\\n at the lesion itself. \\nIt does not add much and can lead to infection. \\nUltrasound can be used to examine more cranial parts of the vertebral column, searching for additional anomalies and is useful to measure the size of the ventricles of the brain aft\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 365}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='er closure of the myelomeningocele.\\nSpina bifida occulta:\\nIn closed or occult spinal dysraphism, also called spina bifida occulta, there is an intact covering of the skin. The anomaly is suspected when there are skin changes like hair tuft\\ns, hemangiomas, pigmented spots, cutaneous dimples or a subcutaneous mass. Another reason to perform ultrasound is when there is a congenital anomaly that is associated with OSD lik\\ne anal atresia. The term OSD implies the presence of one or more spinal cord anomalies, which can cause tethering of the spinal cord and possible neurological and bladder/bowel func\\ntion deficits. \\nThe terms thickened or fatty filum terminale, spinal lipomas, split cord malformations, dermoid cyst, and syringohydromyelia are all different forms of OSD.\\nNormal anatomy:\\nClick to enlarge The spinal cord is depicted as a very hypoechoic structure with a central echogenicity. \\nThis central echogenicity is supposed to represent the interface between the anterior commissure and the median anterior fissure, and not the central canal. Axial image of the spina\\nl cord with central echogenicity. Axial image of the cauda equina. The lower end of the cord is thickened, which is the lumbar intumescence. The cord tapers in a sharp cone (blue ar\\nrow). The cauda equina is seen as a bunch of moving strands.\\nIf the baby is lying in the decubitus position, the strands will gravitate to the dependent posterior side.\\nIf the baby is examined in the prone position with a pillow under the abdomen, the stands will move ventrally. The filum terminale can be seen as a thin echogenic thread.\\nThe dural sac ends at approximately S2. \\nMore distally fatty tissue is present. Video of the normal sagittal anatomy.

Film i\\nn right decubitus position.\\nThe nerve roots are clustered in the dependent side, but move freely. When the nerve roots do not move freely, it can be a sign of OSD.\\nPosition of the conus medullaris:\\nThe normal position of the conus is at L!.\\nIt should not be below L2. The best way to determine the position of the conus medullaris is by identifying the lumbosacral junction at the lordotic angle between the lumbar and sac\\nral vertebrae (arrow).\\nIt can be helpful to flex and extend the pelvis to see the point of motion of the sacrum. In this newborn the lumbosacral junction is less clearly seen because there is no acute ang\\nle.\\nThe numbers that we\\'ve put in, might be wrong. If one is uncertain, make a panoramic or dual image of the lumbosacral vertebral column and compare the vertebral count from below upw\\nards with a lateral plain film. Sagittal view of a normal \"kyphotic\" coccyx in a 2-day-old girl The coccyx, if not yet ossified, is composed of hypoechoic cartilage. \\nIt usually has a kyphotic shape. \\nOn transverse views it should not be confused with a fluid collection or an abscess.\\nNormal variants:\\nTwo-week-old girl with a sacral simple.

Central canal\\nIn this image the central canal is visible as a thin anechoic line in the spinal cord (white arrow). \\nAlthough this is sometimes associated with pathology it is frequently seen as a normal finding. Ventriculus terminalis \\nA small cyst is seen in the proximal filum terminale. \\nThis is called a ventriculus terminalis (or fifth ventricle).\\nSometimes it is seen in the conus medullaris.\\nIt is formed during embryogenesis and usually regresses completely during early childhood.\\nIf it stays persistent, it typically measures less than 2 cm in craniocaudal dimension and 2 mm in transverse dimension and is detected as an asymptomatic and incidental finding in \\nadults.

There is a straight coccyx, which is a normal variant.\\nUsually the coccyx has a anteriorly bent tip, but sometimes it is straight or even dorsally bent, which is also a normal variant.\\nPathology:\\nTethered cord:\\nIn many cases occult spinal dysraphism may not cause any symptoms.\\nHowever in some cases there may develop neurological problems due to tethering of the cord. A tethered cord is a pathologic fixation of the spinal cord in an abnormal caudal locatio\\nn, so that the cord suffers mechanical stretching, distortion and ischemia with growth and development. In these cases ultrasound is well suited to image the contents of the spinal \\ncanal and to look for findings that are associated with a tethered cord (Table).\\nLow conus medullaris:\\nNewborn girl with a cloacal malformation.\\nThe conus medullaris is at L5. \\nNo lipoma visible. \\nFindings were confirmed at MR imaging which was acquired at the age of 9 months.\\nContinue with the MR.

In healthy newborns, the tip of the conus medullaris is located between L1 and L2. \\nThe tip should not be positioned below L2-3.\\nHydromyelia:\\nA hydromyelia is the abnormal widening of the central canal by cerebrospinal fluid. This condition may be either focal or diffuse, extending through the entire length of the spinal \\ncord. It can be associated with several congenital abnormalities including diastematomyelia, Arnold‐Chiari malformation, myelomeningocele and lipomeningocele. If there is a fluid co\\nllection in the cord outside the central canal it is called syringomyelia. \\nBecause it is often not possible to separate these two entities on imaging, it is better to use the term syringohydromyelia. \\nTransverse images will show the transition of the normal cord into the cord which surrounds a CSF collection\\nSpinal lipoma:\\nA spinal lipoma is an encapsulated deposit of fat, neural tissue, meninges or fibrous tissue which extends from the posterior subcutaneous tissue through a midline defect of the fas\\ncia, muscle or bone to communicate with the spinal canal or meninges. A spinal lipoma is seen as an echogenic mass, mostly in the lower spinal canal.\\nThe conus can be too low and buried in the lipoma. Here a sagittal image of a newborn boy with anal atresia.\\nThe conus is blunted and ends at L2-L3. There is an echogenic mass which is likely a lipoma.\\nThe filum is thickened.

The conus medullaris can be too low. Three-day-old girl with a red stain on the lower back, a tuft of hair and\\n a dimple. US shows a tract from the skin towards the dural sac at the S1-S2 level, compatible with a dorsal dermal sinus .\\nThe conus medullaris is at a normal level and there is no other intraspinal pathology present. A T1-weigthed image shows the sinus tract from the skin towards the S1-S2 level. The c\\nonus medullaris is too low at L3-L4. Dermal sinus tracts \\u202fare especially important lesions to recognize because they can extend to the spinal canal and represent an increased risk o\\nf infection such as meningitis and spinal cord abscess.\\nDiastematomyelia:\\nDiastematomyelia, also named split cord malformation, is a longitudinal split of the spinal cord. \\nAt the point of division, there may be an osseous, fibrous or cartilaginous dividing septum.\\nDiastematomyelia is commonly associated with a vertebral column abnormality and a tethered spinal cord. The ultrasound diagnosis is usually straightforward. Here images of a newborn\\n, who had several antenatal anomalies. There was a lateral rocker bottom feet deformity, lumbar kyphoscoliosis and swelling on the lower back. The spinal US and MR show a longitudin\\nal split of the spinal cord at the thoracolumbar level. The bifid cord is asymmetric in volume. Additional plain films of the lumbar spine and pelvis showed thoracic and lumbar hemi\\nvertebrae. There was also a dislocated left hip. Newborn girl with an anorectal malformation. The distal sacrum below S4 is absent.\\nBlunt cord terminus:\\nThis image is of a newborn girl with an anorectal malformation. \\nThe distal sacrum below S4 is absent (arrow).\\nSince an anorectal malformation is frequently associated with spinal pathology, an ultrasound was performed. If a plain film of the vertebral column demonstrates an anomaly of the s\\nacrum, there is a 50% change of an intraspinal anomaly. In most cases there is a low ending tethered cord. In some cases however the cord ends at the normal position, but is deforme\\nd. This is a so-called blunt cord terminus.\\nThere is generally a wedge-shaped ending in which the dorsal side reaches further caudally than the ventral side. Continue with the ultrasound. Ultrasound of the spine shows a blunt\\n cord terminus at T12-L1. A blunt cord terminus is a sign of caudal regression syndrome characterized by abnormal development of the lower end of the spine.

The two major advancements in the treatment of rectal\\n cancer are total mesorectal excision (TME) and neoadjuvant radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.\\nBoth have dramatically changed the local recurrence and survival rates. MRI is the most accurate tool for the local staging of rectal cancer and is a powerful tool to select the app\\nropriate treatment.\\nThe decision whether a patient with rectal cancer is a candidate for TME only or neoadjuvant therapy followed by TME, is made on the findings of the MRI. This updated version includ\\nes: In the end section there are two videos on how to report rectal cancer according to the structured reporting checklist.\\nIf you first want to look at the videos click here.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe illustration shows the mesorectum and the mesorectal fascia, which is the plane for TME resection and the relation of the rectum to the anal sphincter and pelvic floor.\\nTotal Mesorectal Excision:\\nIn TME the entire mesorectal compartment including the rectum, surrounding mesorectal fat and perirectal lymph nodes are completely removed along the mesorectal fascia (figure). TME\\n is the standard surgical resection technique for rectal cancer and can be performed as either a low anterior resection (LAR) where the anal canal is left in situ or an abdominoperi\\nneal resection (APR), where both the rectum and anal canal are resected.\\nRisk Stratification:\\nLocal staging with MRI is performed to determine the best surgical strategy and the necessity for neoadjuvant treatment. Criteria used to define low risk, intermediate risk and high\\n risk disease and their use for treatment stratification vary between countries and guidelines and are continuously evolving. As a rule of thumb we can state the following: Low Risk\\nT1, T2 and in several countries also early stage T3ab tumors without evidence of nodal metastases will generally be considered low risk and do not necessarily require neoadjuvant tr\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 367}),\n",

A short course of radiotherapy (5 \\nx 5 Gy) prior to TME has been shown to reduce the local recurrence risk for these intermediate risk tumors [ref]. High risk or Locally advancedAdvanced T3-4 tumors that invade the m\\nesorectal fascia or adjacent organs, or tumors with many suspicious nodes (N2) are typically regarded as locally advanced. These generally receive a long course of combined chemorad\\niotherapy aiming to induce tumor downsizing and downstaging and enhance the chance of a complete surgical resection [ref]. More recently, the presence of extramural vascular (or ven\\nous) invasion has been proposed as an additional adverse prognostic feature that should be considered a sign of high risk disease. There is a growing tendency to consider minimally \\ninvasive or non-surgical treatment alternatives in tumors that show a complete or near-complete response after neoadjuvant treatment. \\nMRI plays an important role in addition to endoscopy to help select the right patients for these “organ preserving” treatments. In addition to organ-preservation, recent advances in\\n treatment include:\\nStructured Reporting Checklist:\\nClick for larger view A\\ngood quality MRI report includes all risk factors used to stratify patients\\ninto differentiated treatments, as well as an accurate description of the\\nrelation of the tumor to its surrounding anatomy to inform surgical planning (figure). In\\nthe following chapters we will discuss these various items listed in the reporting template in further detail TNM-prefixes “c” is used to indicate the clinical stage, determined bef\\nore treatment.\\nWhen defined based on imaging, the prefix “i\" (imaging) or “mr” (MRI) are sometimes used as alternatives. “y”\\nis used to restage tumors after neoadjuvant treatment (chemo and/or\\nradiotherapy) and can be used for both clinical staging (ycTNM) as well as\\npathological staging (ypTNM). “p” indicates the final TNM stage as determined at histopathology after surgery.\\nMorphology:\\nPolypoid and Sessile tumors:\\nRectal adenocarcinomas typically arise from adenomas that can be either polypoid, which are tumors raised upon a stalk or sessile, which are flat. Polypoid tumors generally represen\\nt more low-grade malignancies and present as a mass projecting into the bowel lumen with a focal attachment or stalk to the bowel wall. Sessile tumors typically present as a semi-ci\\nrcular  or circular wall thickening. The site where the tumor is attached to the rectal wall is often referred to as the “invasive margin” and is the site where we need to focus on \\nwhen assessing the T-stage and looking for extramural tumor extension. The degree of attachment to the rectal wall, also referred to as the tumor circumference, can be described in \\nthe radiology report as “from … to … o’clock”, or alternatively using prose descriptions such as “left anterolateral”. Bright mucinous tumor versus solid tumor with intermediate sig\\nnal.\\nSolid and Mucinous:\\nThe\\ndistinction between solid and mucinous tumor types is relevant because mucinous\\nadenocarcinomas have a poorer prognosis and\\ntypically show a poorer response to neoadjuvant treatment. Mucinous tumors show\\ndistinct bright signal on T2-weighted MRI compared to the more intermediate\\nsignal of solid type tumors (figure). A\\nmore rare subtype of rectal cancer is the signet-ring cell carcinoma, which is\\nassociated with a high risk for nodal and distant metastases and poor overall\\nsurvival. It is seen in only approximately one percent of cases. On MRI signet-ring cell carcinomas can be difficult to\\ndiscern, though they typically show long-segment diffuse bowel wall thickening\\nand a submucosal growth pattern that results in a ‘target’ appearance on axial\\nimages. The\\nimages show a signet-ring cell carcinoma with diffuse thickening of the rectal\\nwall and the target appearance on the axial image. Also note the diffuse\\ninfiltration of the mesorectal fat, which is another common finding of signet\\nring tumors.\\nLocation:\\nSigmoid take-off:\\nDiscriminating\\nrectal from sigmoid cancer is important because the treatment approach differs\\nconsiderably. Routine treatment for sigmoid cancer is upfront resection, while\\nrectal tumours undergo differentiated treatments varying from surgery only in\\nlow risk tumors to long course neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in high risk\\ntumors. In\\n2019 an international consensus panel agreed on the “sigmoid take-off” as the preferred\\nlandmark to define the rectosigmoid junction and separate the rectum from the\\nsigmoid on imaging (ref). The sigmoid take off can be recognized on sagittal MRI as the point from which the sigmoid sweeps horizontally away from the sacrum. The stippled line indi\\ncates the sigmoid take-off on a sagittal and axial view The sigmoid take-off can be recognized on sagittal MRI as the point from which the sigmoid sweeps horizontally away from the \\nsacrum and on an axial view as the point from which the sigmoid projects ventrally (figure). Though recognizing the sigmoid take-off on imaging may be challenging in some cases due \\nto anatomical variations between patients or varying sequence angulation, it is overall an intuitive landmark.

Tumor height The\\nanorectal junction marks the transition between the anal canal and\\ndistal rectum. It is situated at the level of the anorectal angle, which is\\ncaused by contraction of the puborectalis muscle. \\nOn sagittal MRI the anorectal\\njunction is typically situated at the level of an imaginary line between the\\nlower margin of the sacral bone and pubic bone. A\\ncommon approach to determine the height of rectal tumors is to measure the\\ndistance between the lower margin of the tumor and the anorectal junction, or\\nalternatively the distance from the anal verge, which is the transition between\\nthe anal epithelium and perianal skin. In some countries such as the US the location of the tumor in relation to the anterior peritoneal reflection is commonly used as a landmark to\\n determine the tumor height.\\nT-stage:\\nClick image for larger view This illustration shows the T-stages in the sagittal and axial plane. The table shows an overview of the T-staging. Low risk T3 tumors have minimal exten\\nsion into the mesorectal fat up to 5mm (T3ab) and the mesorectal fascia is not involved (distance ≥1mm). High risk T3 tumors extend into the mesorectal fat by > 5mm or invade the me\\nsorectal fascia. T4b tumors invade other organs or structures that are situated outside the mesorectum. The TNM classification system does not include a clear description of what is\\n covered by the umbrella term “structures”. In an international multidisciplinary consensus meeting from 2021 an expert panel of radiologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists and pa\\nthologists proposed that T4b should include invasion of the structures as mentioned in the table [ref].\\nT1-T2 – limited to the bowel wall:\\nT1\\nand T2 tumors are limited to the bowel wall and have a relatively good\\nprognosis. The key finding to ensure that a tumor remains limited to the\\nbowel wall (T1-2) is the presence of an intact muscularis propria, which can be\\nrecognized on MRI as an intact hypointense line surrounding the rectum. Image\\nA cT1-2 tumor in the distal rectum is shown with an intact muscularis\\npropria, which is clearly recognizable as a hypointense outer line of the\\nrectal wall. Pitfall: differentiating T1 from T2 Anatomically,\\nthe rectal wall is comprised of 3 main layers: Typically,\\nthese 3 separate layers on MRI can only be recognized in the case of submucosal\\nedema. In the absence of edema\\nthe rectal wall generally has a two-layered appearance where we can recognize\\nthe muscularis propria but cannot distinguish the mucosa from the submucosa. This\\nis the reason why MRI is generally unable to distinguish T1 tumors (growing\\ninto the submucosa) from T2 tumors (growing into the muscularis propria). Endorectal ultrasound is more accurate for this purpose. Tumors that\\nremain limited to the rectal wall are therefore typically grouped as cT1-2 on MRI.\\nT3 – invasion into the mesorectal fat:\\nT3-tumors\\ngrow through the muscularis propria into the surrounding mesorectum. On MRI this can be recognized as an interruption of the\\nhypointense muscularis propria with spicular or nodular extension of tumor\\nsignal beyond the rectal wall into the mesorectal fat. Image\\nA semicircular rectum tumor with invasion into the mesorectum from\\napproximately 1 to 4 o’clock. It does not grow within 1mm of the mesorectal\\nfascia. The T-stage is T3 MRF- rectal cancer. Subclassification\\nof T3 stage according to invasion depth: Low-risk T3-tumors: High-risk T3-tumors: Pitfall: perirectal stranding It can be difficult to discern true perirectal tumor invasion in T3\\ntumors (case A) from desmoplastic stranding in T1-2 tumors (case B), which can\\nbe a potential cause of overstaging. Note:  \\nThe clinical significance\\nto discern T2 from borderline T3 tumors has been argued as various current  guidelines – including the Dutch guidelines –\\nclassify T3 tumors with limited extension into the mesorectal fat (cT3ab) in\\nthe same good prognostic group as T2 tumors for treatment stratification. In\\nsome guidelines, however, T3 disease by itself is still considered a factor\\nused to determine the need for neoadjuvant treatment.\\nMesorectal fascia involvement:\\nThe mesorectal fascia (MRF) is a thin fibrous\\nstructure  that encloses the mesorectal\\ncompartment and comprises the anticipated resection plane in TME surgery. On\\nT2-weighted MRI the mesorectal fascia can be recognized as a thin hypointense\\nline surrounding the mesorectum. When a tumor directly invades the MRF or the margin between the tumor and MRF is ≤ 1 mm, the MRF is involved.\\nIn these cases routine TME would induce a risk for local recurrence and neoadjuvant treatment will be required to induce tumor downsizing to retract the tumor from the MRF aiming to\\n achieve a tumor-free resection margin.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 369}),\n",

In the right case there is more extensive in\\nvolvement of the MRF between 10 and 12 o’clock Pitfall: circumferential resection margin A\\nradiology report for T3 tumors should include a description of the\\nsmallest distance between the tumor and the MRF, which is sometimes\\nalternatively referred to in radiological reports as the ‘circumferential resection margin’ (CRM). This\\nuse of CRM as a synonym for MRF is not fully accurate as the CRM is actually\\nthe margin that the surgeon creates when performing a TME. Ideally, this will\\nbe along the MRF, but the CRM may be smaller when the MRF is breached during\\nsurgery or wider when the TME resection specimen includes additional fat\\noutside the MRF.\\nMesorectal fascia versus Peritoneum:\\nThe\\nlow rectum is totally covered by the mesorectal fascia (green line). In the\\nmid rectum the mesorectum is covered by the mesorectal fascia on the posterior\\nand lateral side, but on the anterior side it is covered by the visceral\\nperitoneum (red line indicating the peritoneal reflection). In the high rectum the peritoneal lining extends from the\\nanterior to the lateral side (yellow line) and the MRF only lines the dorsal\\npart of the mesorectum. This\\ndistinction is important because invasion of the MRF constitutes T3 MRF+\\ndisease, while growth into the visceral peritoneum entails a risk for tumor spread\\ninto the peritoneal cavity and is staged as T4a disease.\\nT4a - Invasion of peritoneum or peritoneal reflection:\\nThe\\nanterior peritoneal reflection marks the transition between the\\nnon-peritonealized and peritonealized portions of the rectum. \\nOn sagittal\\nT2-weighted images the peritoneal reflection can be recognized as a hypointense\\nV-shaped thin line, sometimes referred to as the ‘seagull sign’. In\\nmales it is located just above the seminal vesicles. In females it is located at the level of the cul-de-sac\\n(Douglas). Pitfall: Overstaging of upper rectal tumours: In upper rectal tumors there will often be a close margin between the rectum and peritoneum. This does not necessarily mean \\nthat we are dealing with a T4a tumor. Tumors should only be classified as cT4a if there is clear tumor extension into or beyond the peritoneum or peritoneal reflection Images The im\\nage on the left shows a tumor with a close relation to the peritoneum and the bladder (white arrow). However there is no tumor extension beyond the muscularis propria anteriorly and\\n the peritoneum is therefore not invaded. The image on the right shows definite tumor invasion of the peritoneum (yellow arrow), i.e. a T4a tumor. Pitfall: reporting of MRF versus p\\neritoneal invasion Note\\nthat in anterior tumors, MRF invasion can only occur in tumors below the\\nperitoneal reflection.\\nTumors above the peritoneal reflection that invade the\\nperitoneum anteriorly (i.e. T4a tumours) are sometimes erroneously reported as\\nMRF+ tumors, which is not correct. cT4a MRF- The upper image shows a cT4a tumor in the upper rectum above\\nthe level of the peritoneal reflection. There is involvement of the peritoneum (yellow stippled line), but not of the\\nmesorectal fascia. cT3 MRF+ The lower image shows a cT3 tumor in the low rectum below the\\nlevel of the peritoneal reflection. There is involvement of the mesorectum on the anterior side\\n(green line), but not of the peritoneum. cT4a MRF+ A combination of involvement of the peritoneum and the mesorectal fascia is also possible, like in this case. This is a tumor in t\\nhe upper rectum with involvement of the peritoneum on the anterior side and involvement of the mesorectal fascia on the posterior side.\\nT4b – Invasion of surrounding organs or structures:\\nT4b tumors invade other organs or structures that are situated outside the mesorectum. The beforementioned 2021 consensus panel proposed that T4b stage should include invasion of th\\ne structures as mentioned in the table (reference). Though this has been a topic of debate, the consensus panel proposed that T4b invasion should also include invasion of any fat th\\nat is situated in another anatomical compartment outside the mesorectum (i.e. beyond the MRF), such as the obturator, parailiac or ischiorectal space. Examples\\nof T4b disease with respective invasion of the prostate (left) and invasion of\\nthe levator ani (right). Note\\nInvasion of striated muscles is considered\\nT4b disease, which includes invasion of the external anal sphincter,\\npuborectalis and levator ani muscles.

Example of an EMVI+ tumor with tumor sig\\nnal extending into an adjacent vessel\\nstructure, expanding and disrupting the vessel contour. Pitfall: How to report MRF involvement by nodes, tumor deposits or EMVI? In\\ncurrent guidelines it is not clearly described how to report MRF involvement by tumor-bearing structures other than the primary tumor. The beforementioned multidisciplinary panel of\\n experts proposed in 2021 that the MRF should be reported as involved in case of a ≤1 mm margin from either the primary tumor, extramural venous invasion or from irregularly enlarge\\nd tumor deposits or from irregular lymph nodes. Potentially malignant, enlarged lymph nodes with a\\nsmooth margin and an apparently intact capsule contacting the MRF have\\na very low risk to result in margin involvement at histopathology and should\\ntherefore not be considered as MRF+ to avoid overtreatment.\\nAnal sphincter and pelvic floor involvement:\\nThe anal sphincter is\\ncomprised of three layers: Together with the iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus\\nmuscles, the puborectalis and levator ani muscles form the “pelvic floor ” In\\nlow rectal cancers, the MRI report should describe the relationship of\\nthe tumor to the anal sphincter and pelvic floor to guide surgical and\\nradiotherapy planning. \\nThis should include a description of which layers of the\\nanal sphincter and/or pelvic floor are involved, and whether invasion extends\\ninto the upper, middle or lower thirds of the anal canal. Pitfall anal sphinter and TNM The TNM staging system does not clearly define how invasion of different layers of the anal s\\nphincter and pelvic floor should be taken into account.

B is an example of a low rectal tumor that invades the internal and external sphincter on the right side (arrowheads). There is also involvement of the p\\nuborectalis and levator ani muscles. Remember that invasion of the external sphincter, puborectalis and levator equals skeletal muscle invasion and should be staged as cT4b disease.\\n Note the normal appearance of the external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles on the left side (green arrow).\\nN-stage:\\nRegional lymph node drainage.

In TME only the mesorectal nodes and in high rectal tumors also the rectalis superior and\\n inferior mesenteric nodes are excised.\\nLymph Node Map:\\nThe terminology used to describe the various lymph node stations in rectal cancer can be a source of confusion. Regional lymph nodesinclude all nodes that are part of the N-stage: N\\notice that in standard TME only the mesorectal nodes are excised and in high rectal tumors also the rectalis superior and inferior mesenteric nodes (yellow area). This means that ot\\nher regional lymph nodes, which are located lateral to the mesorectum like the obturator and internal iliac nodes are not routinely excised. Non-regional lymph nodes(all in red) inc\\nlude all nodes that – when involved – are considered distant nodal metastases and are therefore part of the M-stage: Note As an exception to this rule the AJCC TNM (8th ed.) conside\\nrs inguinal nodes as regional nodes in case of low rectal tumors extending into the distal anal canal, below the level of the dentate line.

Some define tumor deposits as more irregular nodules that are often situated within or along vessels, while pathologic nodes st\\nill have a familiar round or oval shape and capsule typical of lymph nodes (ref). These definitions, however, remain to be validated at large scale.

In addition to yTNM-staging, it is important to give an overall estimation of the degree of response and classify \\npatients as poor, good or potential complete responders to inform further clinical decision making.

After CRT, the majority of nodes decrease in\\nsize or completely disappear on MRI. Nodes that remain clearly visible after\\nCRT are still at risk.

Example of shine through of high T2 signal on DWI from fluid in the rectal lumen. \\nThe ADC map shows an example of T2 dark through with distintly low signal in the fibrotically changed rectal wall. There is no corresponding high signal in the wall on DWI, indicati\\nng that there is no actual diffusion restriction. Susceptibility artefacts Abdominal DWI scans are often acquired using echo planar imaging (EPI), which allows fast image acquisitio\\nn thereby minimizing the risk of motion artefacts.\\nThe main downside of EPI-DWI is that it is highly prone to susceptibility effects, i.e. distortions or artificial pile up of MR signal caused by local field inhomogeneities, especia\\nlly at higher field strengths. In rectal DWI, these susceptibility effects mainly occur at the interface between soft tissue in the rectal wall or tumor and gas in the lumen. \\nWhile large artefacts will be easy to recognize as artefacts, more subtle ones projecting over the rectal wall may be erroneously interpreted as tumor signal. Susceptibility artefac\\nts in rectal DWI may be avoided by reducing the amount of gas in the rectal lumen or  by using alternative methods of DWI acquisition, such as spin echo techniques,  that are less p\\nrone to these susceptibility effects. ImagesThis is a patient with tumor in the right anterolateral rectal wall. Post CRT there is fibrosis visible at the site of the former tumor b\\ned from 9-12 o’clock. The high signal on DWI is located on the contralateral side, outside the tumor bed and corresponds to susceptibility artefacts caused by gas in the rectal lume\\nn. These artefacts should not be mistaken for high signal suspicious of tumor.\\nMR protocol:\\nHardwareMRI of rectal cancer may be performed at either 1.5T or 3.0T,\\nusing  phased array external surface coils. Use\\nof an endorectal coil is not routinely recommended. Patient preparationPatient preparation is not mandatory. \\nUse of spasmolytics may be considered to reduce bowel movement artefacts\\n(particularly in upper rectal tumors that are more prone to these\\nartefacts). \\nUse\\nof endorectal filling is not routinely recommended since distension of the\\nrectum and consequent compression of perirectal tissues may interfere with\\ncorrect interpretation of the distance between the tumor and mesorectal fascia\\n. Preparatory\\nsteps to reduce the amount of gas in the rectal lumen may be helpful to avoid\\ngas-induced susceptibility artifacts on DWI-sequences, although this is mainly\\nan issue in the restaging setting where DWI plays a more important role. \\nThis\\ncan be achieved for example by  giving patients a preparatory micro-enema\\nor a small volume of rectal filling (up to 60 ml). Sagittal series\\nThe sagittal series is used to localize the tumor and to plan the\\naxial and coronal series. The cranial border of the field of view (FOV) should\\nbe at the level of the sacral promontory and the caudal border below the anal\\ncanal. Axial series\\nThe axial (or oblique-axial) view should be angled perpendicular\\nto the tumor axis to allow proper assessment of the extension of the tumor\\nbeyond the rectal wall and the distance between the tumor and MRF. Coronal series\\nThe coronal\\nsequence should be angled parallel to the tumor axis, which is perpendicular to the axial series.

Richard Baron is Chair of Radiol\\nogy at the University of Chicago and well known for his work on hepatobiliary diseases. He has been president of the Society of Computed Body Tomography and Magnetic Resonance. In P\\nart I a basic concept is given on how to detect and characterize livermasses with CT. In Part II the imaging features of the most common hepatic tumors are presented.\\nHemangioma:\\nHemangioma is the most common benign liver tumor. It is composed of multiple vascular channels lined by endothelial cells. In 60% of cases more than one hemangioma is present. The s\\nize varies from a few millimeters to more than 10 cm (giant hemangiomas). Calcification is rare and seen in less than 10%, usually in the central scar of giant hemangioma. Typical h\\nemangioma matches the bloodpool in every phase. CT will show hemangiomas as sharply defined masses with the same density as the vessels on NECT and CECT. The enhancement pattern is \\ncharacterized by sequential contrast opacification beginning at the periphery as one or more nodular areas of enhancement. All these areas of enhancement must have the same density \\nas the bloodpool. This means that in the arterial phase the areas of enhancement must have almost the density of the aorta, while in the portal venous phase the enhancement must be \\nof the same density as the portal vein. Even on delayed images the density of a hemangioma must be of the same density as the vessels. Finally most hemangiomas show complete fill in\\n with contrast. Flash filling hemangioma in unenhanced, arterial and portal venous phase. Notice it matches the bloodpool. Small hemangiomas may show fast homogeneous enhancement ('\\nflash filling'). Small HCC and hypervascular metastases may mimic small hemangiomas because they all show homogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase. By looking at the other phas\\nes to see if the enhancing areas match the bloodpool, it is usually possible to differentiate these lesions. Giant hemangiomas with scar-tissue. Notice that the enhancement matches \\nthe bloodpool in all phases. Central scar is hypodens on NECT and stays hypodens. Large hemangiomas can have an atypical appearance. Complete fill in is sometimes prevented by centr\\nal fibrous scarring. These lesions need to be differentiated from other lesions with a scar like FLC, FNH and Cholangiocarcinoma. Again looking at the bloodpool will help you. On th\\ne left two large hemangiomas. Notice that the enhancing parts of the lesion follow the bloodpool in every phase, but centrally there is scar tissue that does not enhance. LEFT: rime\\nnhancement in breast metastasis. RIGHT: nodular discontinuous enhancement in hemangioma. Peripheral enhancement The enhancement of a hemangioma starts peripheral . It is nodular or \\nglobular and discontinuous. Rim enhancement is continuous peripheral enhancement and is never hemangioma. Rim enhancement is a feature of malignant lesions, especially metastases. L\\niver lesion showing nodular enhancement, progressive fill in and delayed enhancement. Progressive fill in First look at the images on the left and describe what you see. Then contin\\nue. The lesion definitely has some features of a hemangioma like nodular enhancement in the arterial phase and progressive fill in in the portal venous and equilibrium phase. In the\\n portal venous phase however, the enhancement is not as bright as the enhancement of the portal vein. The conclusion must be, that this lesion does not match bloodpool in all phases\\n, so it cannot be a hemangioma. So progressive fill in is a non-specific feature, that can be seen in many other lesions like metastases or primary liver tumors like cholangiocarcin\\noma. The delayed enhancement in this lesion is due to fibrotic tissue in a cholangiocarcinoma and is a specific feature of these tumors. LEFT: Classic US appearance of a hemangioma.\\nRIGHT: Also a hemangioma but now in a hyperechoic liver, so the lesion is relatively hypoechoic. Notice increased sound transmission. Ultrasound Most hemangiomas are detected with U\\nS. If you had to pick one word to characterize a hemangioma on US, you would probably say 'hyperechoic'.\\nYou have to realize however, that this simply means that the lesion is hyperechoic to normal liver. If the liver is hyperechoic due to steatosis, the hemangioma can appear hypoechoi\\nc (figure). Another important feature of hemangiomas is the increased sound transmission. This is because the lesion is made of these channels containing blood. Differential diagnos\\nis Hemangiomas must be differentiated from other lesions that are hypervascular or lesions that show peripheral enhancement and progressive fill in.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 376}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):\\nHCC is the most frequent abdominal malignancy worldwide and is especially common in Asia and mediterrean countries. HCC may be solitary, multifocal or diffusely infiltrating. HCC co\\nnsists of abnormal hepatocytes arranged in a typical trabecular pattern. Larger HCC lesions typically have a mosaic appearance due to hemorrhage and fibrosis. In patients with cirrh\\nosis or with hepatitis B/C our major concern is HCC, since 85% of HCC occur in these patients. If you take a cohort of patients with hepatitis C and you follow them for 10 years, 50\\n% of them will have end stage liver disease and 25% will have HCC. Small HCC seen only in arterial phase in a patient with cirrhosis.\\nEarly appearance of HCC:\\nIt is important to separate the early appearance from the late appearance of HCC. Nowadays we encounter very small HCC's in patients, that we screen for HCC (figure). These are smal\\nl lesions that transiently enhance homogeneously. You will only see them in the arterial phase. Sometimes there is rim enhancement and you might mistake them for a hemangioma. Alway\\ns look how they present in the other phases and compare with the bloodpool and remember that rim enhancement is never hemangioma. These early HCC's are very different from the large\\n ones that we see in the non-cirrhotic patients. Large HCC with mozaik pattern in a non cirrhotic patient.\\nLate appearance of HCC:\\nHCC is a silent tumor, so if patients do not have cirrhosis or hepatitis C, you will discover them in a late stage. They tend to be very large with a mozaic pattern, a capsule, hemo\\nrrhage, necrosis and fat evolution. HCC becomes isodense or hypodense to liver in the portal venous phase due to fast wash-out.\\nOn delayed images the capsule and sometimes septa demonstrate prolonged enhancement. LEFT: Diffusely enhancing tumor thrombus in HCC with portal vein invasion.RIGHT: Tumor thrombus \\nwith vessels within the thrombus. HCC and Portal Vein thrombosis Many patients with cirrhosis have portal venous thrombosis and many patients with HCC have thrombosis. These are two\\n common findings and they can be coincidental. It is very important to make the distinction between just thrombus and tumor thrombus. First, if you have a malignant thrombus in the \\nportal vein, it will always enhance and you'll see it best in arterial phase. Secondly, if you have a malignant thrombus in the portal vein, it will increase the diameter of the ves\\nsel. Sometimes a tumor thrombus may present with neovascularity within the thrombus (figure).\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\nMetastases can look like almost any lesion that occurs in the liver. \\nHypervascular metastases have to be differentiated from other hypervascular tumors that can be multifocal like hemangiomas, FNH, adenoma and HCC. \\nHypovascular metastases have to be differentiated from focal fatty infiltration, abscesses, atypical hypovascular HCC and cholangiocarcinoma. Metastasis difficult to detect on CECT \\nin portal venous phase (left). Better seen on NECT. Metastases in fatty liver Focal fatty sparing in a diffusely fatty liver or foci of focal fatty infiltration can simulate metasta\\nses. However on nonenhanced scans these regions of fat variation tend to be nonspherical and geographic, with no mass effect or distortion of the local vessels. On the other hand a \\nfatty liver can also obscure metastases. On a contrast enhanced CT hypovascular lesions can be obscured if the liver itself is lower in density due to fat deposition. On a NECT thes\\ne lesions usually are better depicted (figure). Steatosis of right liver lobe. No lesions detectable. On US multiple lesions in the same region. If a patient is known to have a fatt\\ny liver, it is better to do an MRI or ultrasound for the detection of livermetastases. On the left a patient with fatty infiltration of large parts of the liver.\\nNo metastases were seen, but on an ultrasound of the same region multiple metastases were detected.\\nHepatic Adenoma:\\nHepatocellular adenomas are large, well circumscribed encapsulated tumors.\\nThey consist of sheets of hepatocytes without bile ducts or portal areas. 80% of adenomas are solitary and 20% are multiple. Adenomas typically measure 8-15 cm and consist of sheets\\n of well-differentiated hepatocytes. Adenomas are prone to central necrosis and hemorrhage because the vascular supply is limited to the surface of the tumor. The pathogenesis is be\\nlieved to be related to a generalized vascular ectasia that develops due to exposure of the liver to oral contraceptives and related synthetic steroids. In young woman using contrac\\neptives an adenoma is the most frequent hepatic tumor. CT will show most adenomas as a lesion with homogeneous enhancement in the late arterial phase, that will stay isodense to the\\n liver in later phases. Unfortunately, this homogeneous enhancement in the late arterial phase is not specific to adenomas, since small HCC's and hemangiomas as well as hypervascula\\nr metastases and FNH can demonstrate similar enhancement in the arterial phase. Malignant lesions however have a tendency to loose their contrast faster than the surrounding liver, \\nso they may become relatively hypodense in later phases. The finding of hemorrhage as an area of high attenuation can be seen in as many as 40% of adenomas. This is however also a f\\neature of HCC and large hemangiomas. Fat deposition within adenomas is identified on CT in only approximately 7% of patients and is better depicted on MRI. Typically adenomas have w\\nell-defined borders and do not have lobulated contours. A low-attenuation pseudocapsule can be seen in as many as 30% of patients. This capsule will only show enhancement on delayed\\n scans. Coarse calcifications are seen in only 5% of patients. On the left an adenoma with fat deposition and a capsule. MRI usually is more sensitive in detecting fat and hemorrhag\\ne. Chemical-shift imaging showing loss of signal on out-of-phase images can confirm the presence of fat. HCC is known to contain fat in as many as 40% of lesions, therefore the pres\\nence of fat does not help differentiate the lesions. Adenoma with hemorrhage. Adenomas may rupture and bleed, causing right upper quadrant pain. The two most common liver lesions ca\\nusing hepatic hemorrhage are HA and HCC. Although adenomas are benign lesions, they can undergo malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although malignant transf\\normation is rare, for this reason, surgical resection is advocated in most patients with presumed adenomas. Enhancing adenoma with fat in the center Significant overlap is noted bet\\nween the CT appearances of adenoma, HCC, FNH, and hypervascular metastases, making a definitive diagnosis based on CT imaging criteria alone difficult and often not possible. Clinic\\nal correlation in such cases is most helpful. In otherwise healthy young women using oral contraceptives, adenoma is favored. Patients with glycogen storage disease, hemochromatosis\\n, acromegaly, or males on anabolic steroids also are more prone to developing hepatic adenomas.\\nA history of cirrhosis and high AFP levels favor HCC. A history of a primary hypervascular tumor favors metastases. Adenoma showing capsule in delayed phase As a result of the risk \\nof intraperitoneal hemorrhage and the rare occurrence of malignant transformation to HCC, surgical resection has been advocated in most patients with presumed HA. The risk of signif\\nicant bleeding from the tumor is as high as 30%. The exact risk of malignant transformation is unknown. Some advocate surgical resection only when tumors are larger than 5 cm or whe\\nn AFP levels are elevated, since these two findings are associated with higher risk of malignancy. The value of percutaneous fine needle biopsy for the diagnosis of HA is controvers\\nial for two reasons. First, histologic studies may lead to misdiagnosis when differentiating HA from FNH. In addition, a considerable risk of hemorrhage exists when biopsy is perfor\\nmed on these hypervascular tumors. Adenomas may diminish after oral contraceptives are discontinued, but this does not lower the risk of malignant transformation. When a definitive \\ndiagnosis of FNH can be made using imaging studies, surgery can be avoided and lesions can be observed safely using radiologic studies. However, if HA or HCC remains in the differen\\ntial diagnosis, surgery usually is indicated.\\nFocal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH):\\nFNH is the second most common tumor of the liver. FNH is not a true neoplasm. It is believed to represent a hyperplastic response to increased blood flow in an intrahepatic arteriov\\nenous malformation. All the normal constituents of the liver are present but in an abnormally organized pattern. US will show a FNH as a non specific ill-defined lesion. The central\\n scar may be detected as a hyperechoic area, but often cannot be differentiated. With color doppler sometimes the vessels can be seen within the scar. CT will show FNH as a vascular\\n tumor, that will be hyperdens in the arterial phase, except for the central scar. On the left a typical FNH with a central scar that is hypodens in the portal venous phase and hype\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 377}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"rdens in the equilibrium phase. MRI will show a hypointense central scar on T1-weighted images. On T2-weighted images the scar appears as hyperintense in 80% of patients, which is v\\nery typical.\\nHowever in 20% of patients the scar is hypointense. Gadolineum enhanced MRI will reveal similar enhancement patterns as on CECT. FNH seen as hypervascular lesion in the late arteria\\nl phase and isodense to normal liver in the portal venous phase. No scar was seen. The diagnosis of FNH is based on the demonstration of a central scar and a homogeneous enhancement\\n. However, a typical central scar may not be visible in as many as 20% of patients (figure). Moreover a central scar may be found in some patients with fibrolamellar hepatocellular \\ncarcinoma, hepatic adenoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The key to the diagnosis in the lesion on the left is the fact that it is isoattenuating to normal liver in the porta\\nl venous phase and stays that way without a wash out on the delayed phase (not shown). This could also be an adenoma, but HCC would be unlikely because they show a fast wash out. T2\\nWI, T1WI without Gadolineum and a delayed phase after Gadolineum. If you look at the images on the left and just would consider the T2W-images, what could be the cause of the centra\\nl area of high signal? The most common cause would be central necrosis in a tumor. However if you look at the delayed phase, you will notice that this area enhances. So this is fibr\\notic tissue and the diagnosis is FNH. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) has a dark scar on T2WI and FNH has a brigth scar on T2WI in 80% of the cases. This means that at times the diffe\\nrential between FNH and FLC will not be possible.\\nFibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC):\\nFLC is an uncommon malignant hepatocellular tumor, but less aggressive than HCC. FLC characteristically manifests as a 10-20 cm large hepatic mass in adolescents or young adults. Th\\ne typical risk factors for HCC such as cirrhosis, elevated alphafetoprotein, viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse are absent. FLC characteristically appears as a lobulated heterogeneous m\\nass with a central scar in an otherwise normal liver. Calcifications occur in 30-60% of fibrolamellar tumors. LEFT: FLC in late arterial phase: central calcification and heterogenou\\ns enhancement in a lamellar pattern. RIGHT: venous phase with hypodense central scar. Imaging features of FLC overlap with those of other scar-producing lesions including FNH, HCC, \\nHemangioma and Cholangiocarcinoma. FNH, in particular, may simulate FLC, since both have similar demographic and clinical characteristics. In contrast to FNH the central scar in FLC\\n will usually be hypointense on T2WI and will less often show delayed enhancement. While FNH is always very homogeneous, FLC is usually heterogeneous following contrast administrati\\non. On the left pathologic specimens of FLC and FNH. At first glance they look very similar. However when you look carefully you will notice the lamellar and heterogenous structure \\nof FLC compared to the homogeneous appearance of FNH. On non enhanced images a FLC usually presents as a big mass with central calcifications.\\nCholangiocarcinoma:\\nCholangiocarcinoma usually presents as a mass of 5-20cm. In 65% there are satellite nodules and in some cases punctate calcifications are seen. The diagnosis of a cholangiocarcinoma\\n is often difficult to make for a radiologist and even a pathologist. That is because cholangiocarcinoma has a varied morphology and histology. It can be a constricting or an expand\\ning lesion, because it can have a fibrous or a glandular stroma. It can be located anywhere in the intrahepatic bile ducts or common bile duct. Cholangiocarcinoma: Non enhanced, art\\nerial, portal venous and equilibrium phase. First look at the images on the left and try to find good descriptive terms for what you see. Then continue. The lesion on the left has t\\nhe folowing characteristics: The finding of an infiltrating mass with capsular retraction and delayed persistent enhancement is very typical for a cholangiocarcinoma. Infiltrative c\\nholangiocarcinoma does not cause mass effect, because when the stroma matures, the fibrous tissue will contract and cause retraction of the liver capsule. There are not many tumors \\nthat cause retraction of the liver capsule, since most tumors will bulge. The most common tumor that causes retraction besides cholangiocarcinoma is metastatic breast cancer. This w\\nill give a pseudo-cirrhosis appearance. Another cause of local retraction is atrophy due to biliary obstruction or chronic portal venous obstruction. The case on the left demonstrat\\nes how difficult the detection of ta cholangiocarcinoma can be. Only on the delayed images at 8-10 minutes after contrast injection a relative hyperdense lesion is seen. This is the\\n fibrous component of the tumor. Some cholangiocarcinomas have a glandular stroma.\\nHepatic Metastases:\\nThe liver is the most common site of metastases. The most common organs of origin are: colon, stomach, pancreas, breast and lung. Most liver metastases are multiple, involving both \\nlobes in 77% of patients and only in 10% of cases there is a solitary metastasis. Hypovascular metastases are the most common and occur in GI tract, lung, breast and head/neck tumor\\ns. They are detected as hypodense lesions in the late portal venous phase. In this phase the attenuation of the normal liver parenchyma increases, revealing the relatively hypoatten\\nuating metastases, sometimes with peripheral enhancement. The rim enhancement that occurs represents viable tumor peripherally, which appears against a less viable or necrotic cente\\nr (figure). Hypervascular metastases are less common and are seen in renal cell carcinoma, insulinomas, carcinoid, sarcomas, melanoma and breast cancer. They are best seen in the la\\nte arterial phase at 35 sec after contrast injection. Although breast cancer metastases can be hypervascular, it was shown that routine use of adding arterial phase imaging, did not\\n show any advantage. Calcified liver metastases are uncommon. Calcification can be seen in metastases of colon, stomach, breast, endocrine pancreatic ca, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcom\\na and melanoma. When calcified liver metastases are revealed by CT in a patient with unknown primary tumor, colon cancer will be the most likely cause. Cystic liver metastases are s\\neen in mucinous ovarian ca, colon ca, sarcoma, melanoma, lung ca and carcinoid tumor. On MRI metastases are usually hypointense on T1WI and hyperintense on T2WI. Peritumoral edema m\\nakes lesions appear larger on T2WI and is very suggestive of a malignant mass. On dynamic contrast-enhanced MRi the characteristics of metastases are the same as for CECT. Calcified\\n metastasis in a patient with colon cancer. Ultrasound findings At US, metastases may appear cystic,hypoechoic, isoechoic or hyperechoic. Bull's eye or target lesions is a common pr\\nesentation of metastases. In these metastases the halo is most probably related to a combination of compressed normal hepatic parenchyma around the mass and a zone of cancer cell pr\\noliferation. This pattern suggests aggressive behavior and is seen in bronchogenic, breast and colon carcinoma, . However, this pattern is not specific for metastases as it can also\\n be seen in primary malignant liver neoplasms (eg, HCC) and benign liver neoplasms (eg, adenoma in glycogen storage disease). A similar appearance has been described with liver absc\\nesses.\\nCalcified metastases may shadow when they are densely echogenic (figure). This pattern is commonly seen in colorectal cancer.\\nLiver abces:\\nThe presentation of liver abcesses is very much dependend on the way the bacteria have entered the liver. There are four routes for bacteria to get into the liver. The common route \\nis through the portal vein as a result of abdominal infection. The bacteria enter through the slow flow portal system and they are layered within the vessel. The bacteria will fall \\ndown into the dependent portion of the right lobe. In sepsis the spread will be via the arterial system as in patients with endocarditis and there will be multiple abscesses spread \\nout through the periphery of the liver. The biliary route is often the result of biliary manipulation as in ERCP. It is usually central in location and then spreads out. Finally the\\nre is a direct route as in penetrating injury or direct spread of cholecystitis into the liver. Liver abcess in a patient with diverticulitis. First look at the images on the left a\\nnd try to find good descriptive terms for what you see. Then continue. If you would describe the image on the left, you would use terms as: So these findings suggest liverabscesses \\nespecially because it's clustered. Only when you have a population with livertransplants, bilomas in an infarcted area would look the same. If it wasn't clustered than any cystic tu\\nmor could look like this. It is very important to make the diagnosis of liver absces because it is a benign disease that kills and the radiologist may be the first to raise the susp\\nicion. LEFT: Small cyst-like lesion after recent ERCPRIGHT: 3 weeks later a large absces had developed. Whenever you see a small cyst-like lesion in a patient who recently underwent\\n an ERCP, be very carefull to assume it is just a simple cyst. Biliary abscesses start small but can progress rapidly. The figure on the left shows such a case. Within 3 weeks the s\\nmall lesion in the left liver lobe progressed to this huge abces.

Important issues in these gui\\ndelines are: The same approach for nodules detected incidentally as for those detected through screening. Introduction\\nIntroduction:\\nBTS guideline:\\nThe figure shows a comprehensive version of the BTS-algorithms. No follow up for nodules < 5mm and typically benign lesions with benign calcifications like hamartomas and perifissur\\nal nodules.\\n* Step 2 Only lesions of 5mm or more require follow up. Divide lesions into solid and subsolid (groundglass or part solid)\\n* Step 3 Use the Brock Model application to assess the risk of malignancy for solid lesions >8mm and subsolid lesions that are stable during 3 month follow up.\\n* Step 4 Use the Herder model when you perform a PET-CT. Follow-up takes 1 year if volumetry is used, while manual 2D-measurements warrant a 2 year follow-up period. Nodules that sh\\now volume change less than 25% should be regarded stable and discharged after the indicated follow-up interval. Consider discharge only if VDT >600 days is calculated using volumetr\\ny. When there is previous imaging, determine the risk of lung cancer based on the volume doubling time. Example 1 A solitary non-spiculated solid nodule of 7 mm (162 mm3) is shown i\\nn the RLL of a 55 year old male without a positive family history, but with some emphysema. Follow-up showed long term stability with 7 mm (146 mm3) at 12 months. Patient was discha\\nrged from further CT surveillance. Example 2 A solitary non-spiculated solid nodule of 9 mm (362 mm3) is shown in the LLL of a 75 year old female without a positive family history o\\nr emphysema. Risk prediction by the Brock model equalled 6.3%, indicating surveillance with CT at 3 months. This showed borderline stability, but CT at 12 months showed evident grow\\nth with a VDT <400 days. Wedge resection after wire-localization was performed, diagnosing a pulmonary carcinoid.\\nBTS Pulmonary Nodule Risk Prediction Calculator:\\nClick here to use the calculator for the Brock model, Herder model and the volume doubling time calculator after checking the box to accept the conditions of use. With this calculat\\nor you can calculate: You can also download the calculator-app on your iPhone or Android phone. Click here to see the app in the App Store. The BTS guidelines allow both measurement\\ns obtained using a 2D caliper technique and 3D nodule volumetry. Note that the 2D measurement is the single maximal diameter and not the average of short- and long-axis diameters, a\\ns in the Fleischner method. In case of multiple pulmonary nodules, the risk assessment and follow-up strategy is based on the largest nodule. Nodule growth is defined as an volume i\\nncrease ≥25%. When the volume increase is less than 25%, the lesion is called stable.\\nBrock Model:\\nMcWilliams and colleagues developed the Brock model for pulmonary nodule malignancy risk prediction [2]. Use the app to fill in the nodule and patient characteristics and it will ca\\nlculate the malignancy risk. Here we see an example of a 45 year old woman with an 8 mm solid nodule not located in the upper lobe and without spiculation. There is no family histor\\ny of lung cancer and there is no emphysema. The app calculates a malignancy risk of 1.9%. Here another example of a 65 year old man with an 26 mm solid nodule located in the upper l\\nobe with spiculation. There is a family history of lung cancer and there is emphysema. The app calculates a malignancy risk of 67.7%.\\nHerder model:\\nThe BTS guideline applies the Herder model to reassess the malignancy risk in nodules that are evaluated with PET-CT after a prior increased risk for malignancy, defined as a Brock \\nscore ≥10%. It calculates the risk that a nodule will be diagnosed as cancer using : age, smoking status, history of extra-thoracic cancer\\n* Nodule characteristics: size, upper lobe location, spiculation.\\n* FDG-avidity: no - faint - moderate - intense. This model showed excellent performance [3], although the performance is limited for subcentimeter nodules due to PET-CT resolution. \\nAn example of the Herder model in the app is seen here. It is the same 65-year old man as in the example of the Brock model. Notice that the probability of lung cancer dropped from \\n67.7% to 10.4% based on the fact that there was no FDG-uptake in the lesion.\\nPerifissural nodules:\\nAll the profits of the Radiology Assistant go to Medical Action Myanmar which is run by Dr. Nini Tun and Dr. Frank Smithuis sr, who is a professor at Oxford university and happens t\\no be the brother of Robin Smithuis.

Many of these lesions are incidentally discovered and called incidentalomas. An adrenal incidentaloma is defined as a mas\\ns > 1 cm that is detected on imaging exams not performed for suspected adrenal disease. Most of these incidentalomas are benign non-functioning adenomas even in patients with a know\\nn malignancy. In this article we will discuss the evaluation and management of adrenal masses by dividing them into: Indeterminate lesions > 4 cm Systematic Approach\\nSystematic Approach:\\nAdrenal incidentalomas are common and seen in about 3% of abdominal CT's, increasing up to 10% in elderly patients [1,2,3]. The issue is to differentiate benign adrenal tumors from \\nmetastases or primary malignant masses without unnecessarily exposing the majority of patients to the burden of clinical workup, interventions and imaging follow-up. First, determin\\ne whether a lesion has typically benign or indeterminate imaging features. If it is indeterminate, do a washout-CT or an MRI to see whether it is a lipid-poor adenoma. If it is not \\nan adenoma, then you have to choose between follow up, PET-CT, biopsy or resection. When an adrenal incidentaloma is detected, use the following steps: This includes lesions that sh\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 379}),\n",

If the lesion is indeterminate and 1-4 cm in diameter: We will now discuss each of these possibilities.\\nTypically Benign lesions:\\nMany adrenal lesions can be categorized as typically benign and need no follow up (table): 'No enhancement' is defined as less than 10HU difference between the unenhanced and enhanc\\ned CT. Here some examples of typically benign lesions. Lipid-rich adenoma 70% of adenomas contain high intracellular fat and will be of low attenuation on unenhanced CT [4,5]. A den\\nsity equal to or below 10 HU is considered diagnostic of a lipid-rich adenomas. Using a safe threshold value of 10HU on a native CT scan results in a sensitivity of 70-79% and a hig\\nh specificity of 96-98% for the diagnosis of an adenoma [5-7]. Lipid-poor adenoma 30% of adrenal adenomas do not contain enough intracellular lipid to have a density of less than 10\\n HU and cannot be differentiated from non-adenomas on an unenhanced CT. These adenomas are called lipid-poor. They can be diagnosed with dedicated adrenal-CT to look for fast wash-o\\nut. These lipid-poor adenomas will be discussed in the chapter on indeterminate lesions. The images show bilateral adrenal incidentalomas found in a 64-year old patient scanned for \\nanalysis of an abdominal aneurysm. The scan in the arterial phase shows bilateral lesions with a density of 50 HU. On the non-enhanced CT performed a few days later, the density in \\nboth adrenal glands was less than 10 HU, proving these to be lipid-rich adenomas. Cyst An uncomplicated cyst is a well-defined lesion of water density that does not enhance. A cyst \\nhas a thin wall and may have thin septa. It may be an endothelial cyst or a pseudocyst, which are the most common, or a true epithelial or parasitic cyst (both rare) [5]. Pseudocyst\\ns may have thicker walls. Hemorrhage or debris may cause increased internal attenuation. Both benign and malignant tumors may show cystic degeneration and necrosis. In those cases d\\nensity measurements are unreliable. Features of an underlying tumor may be an irregular thick wall of 5 mm or more and mural, septal or solid enhancement [5]. Lesions with benign ca\\nlcifications Lesions with benign calcifications Coarse rounded, peripheral or septal calcifications are typically benign and may be seen in: Bilateral calcifications also suggest a \\nbenign origin. Punctate, dystrophic and irregular calcifiations are not typically benign and can be seen in: Myelolipoma Myelolipomas are benign tumors composed of bone marrow eleme\\nnts. Usually they are easy to recognize on CT or MR because they contain areas of macroscopic fat. Calcifications are seen in 24% of cases. The adrenal mass seen here on CT contains\\n macroscopic fat, which is specific for the diagnosis myelolipoma. On the right a different case with high SI on T1W-image indicating macroscopic fat in a myelolipoma. CT image of a\\nnother adrenal mass mainly composed of macroscopic fat. Diagnosis: myelolipoma.\\nIndeterminate lesions 1-4 cm:\\nMany adrenal lesions cannot be confidently diagnosed as either lipid-rich adenomas or another benign entity because the density is too high on the unenhanced CT or because there is \\nonly an enhanced CT to start with. These lesions are called indeterminate. These include the 30% of adenomas that are lipid-poor. In order to find out if a lesion is a lipid-poor ad\\nenoma you can do a CT washout scan and look for rapid wash-out, or an MRI and look for signal drop on the out-of-phase scan.\\nAdrenal Washout:\\nAdenomas, both lipid-rich and lipid-poor, rapidly wash out contrast. Non-adenomas, for instance metastases, generally enhance rapidly, but take longer to washout. Absolute washoutA \\ndedicated adrenal washout CT protocol consists of a non-contrast, a contrast -enhanced scan with a delay of 60-90 sec and a delayed scan at 15 minutes. The ROI should encompass at l\\neast 2/3 of the lesion to ensure a representable assessment. Absolute enhancement wash out ⩾ 60% is proof of an adenoma [5,6,8]. Relative washout If an adrenal lesion is discovered \\non an enhanced scan while the patient is still on the table, then a second scan of the adrenals at 15 minutes after contrast injection can be made and the relative washout can be ca\\nlculated. Relative enhancement wash out ⩾ 40% is proof of an adenoma [5,6,8]. Adrenal washout pitfallsImportant exceptions to the washout rule are caused by tumors that show absolut\\ne and relative washout percentages within the adenoma-range, in decreasing order of occurence:\\nWashout Calculator:\\nClick here to go to the Adrenal Characterization Calculator.\\nLipid-poor adenomas:\\nThe images show an indeterminate lesion on the nonenhanced CT (density 24 HU). The absolute washout in this patient is 62%. This means that the lesion is a lipid-poor adenoma. Usual\\nly adenomas show different enhancement compared to malignant lesions. On an enhanced CT at 60 sec most adenomas show mild enhancement, while malignant tumors and pheochromocytomas s\\nhow strong enhancement. There is however too much overlap in enhancement to allow accurate differentiation between these lesions and that is why we need a wash-out CT scan.\\nMRI Out-of-phase imaging:\\nLipid-poor adenomas can also be diagnosed with out-of-phase imaging. They contain enough microscopic fat to cause a signal drop on out-of-phase imaging compared to in-phase imaging \\ndue to the chemical shift artefact. These images are of a 65- year-old female patient with an incidental discovery of a right adrenal mass on an abdominal ultrasound performed for r\\nenal stones. The presence of microscopic fat is demonstrated by the signal drop on the opposed-phase image. The patient was followed for 2 years, because the lesion is slightly inho\\nmogeneous and measures 5.2 cm. The lesion did not change in size and was not hormonally active. It was diagnosed as a lipid-poor adenoma. MRI performed for a left adrenal incidental\\noma discovered on a non-contrast and arterial phase CT scan in a 61-year old male patient with an abdominal aneurysm. On the non-contrast CT density was 18 HU. T1 out-of phase image\\n shows subtle inhomogeneous signal drop compared to in-phase. Note that the fat-suppressed T1 does not help in the detection of microscopic intracellular fat. Continue with next ima\\nges. The subtle central hyperintensity on the T1 fat sat is also hyperintense on the T2-weighted images and doesn't enhance on the post-contrast image. After comparison with prior C\\nT images from years before, the lesion turned out to be a slowly growing adenoma with recent internal hemorrhage.\\nIndeterminate lesions > 4 cm:\\nThe maximum diameter of the adrenal mass is predictive of malignancy. In particular, lesions > 4 cm are more likely to be either metastases or adrenocortical carcinomas. Adrenal mas\\ns size is important for two more reasons. The overall prognosis is better for small adrenocortical carcinomas and smaller tumors are easier to resect by minimally invasive surgical \\ntechniques. Therefore, the recommendation for an indeterminate adrenal mass > 4 cm in size and no history of cancer is surgical resection -in most cases without biopsy - in order to\\n timely treat a possible primary adrenal cortical carcinoma [3,9]. The next cases are examples of indeterminate lesions > 4 cm. All were incidentally discovered in patients without \\na history of cancer. All diagnoses were histologically proven and showed a wide variety of both benign and malignant tumors. Metastasis of an adenocarcinoma The image shows a hetero\\ngeneous ill-defined mass larger than 4 cm. There is a hypo-enhancing center, which is probably the result of central necrosis. In this particular case a biopsy was performed and rev\\nealed an adenocarcinoma, probably from primary lung carcinoma. Surprisingly, extensive imaging analysis, including FDG PET-CT, did not detect a primary tumor, however. Adrenocortica\\nl carcinoma The image shows a 67 mm heterogeneously enhancing relatively well defined lesion. This proved to be an adrenocortical carcinoma, after resection. Adrenal leiomyoma The i\\nmage shows a large indeterminate lesion with different densities and a partly calcified rim. Biopsy revealed an adrenal leiomyoma. The lesion was resected. Pheochromocytoma This is \\na heterogeneously enhancing, relatively well-defined indeterminate lesion. It proved to be a pheochromocytoma. Atypical adenoma A 7cm hyperenhancing adrenal lesion with small cystic\\n spots. The lesion was resected because of its large size and indeterminate imaging features. This proved to be an adenoma.\\nSpecific Adrenal tumors:\\nPheochromocytomas: strong enhancement in all 4 cases, even in the smaller tumors\\nPheochromocytomas:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 380}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that originate in the adrenal medulla. Usually, tumors are larger than 3 cm when found. Nonfunctioning tumors are typically larger than functioning\\n tumors. A typical pheochromocytoma will have an unenhanced density >10 HU, or higher in case of hemorrhage. They are highly vascular, resulting in strong enhancement, but in contra\\nst to adenomas they usually have delayed washout [4,5]. Pheochromocytoma with small cyst In 10% pheochromocytomas have calcifications and they frequently have multiple cysts (yellow\\n arrows). This image shows another pheochromocytoma with multiple cysts. Larger tumors are prone to hemorrhage and necrosis, even when they are benign. Pheochromocytomas are nicknam\\ned \"imaging chameleons\" because many imaging features overlap with other tumors [5]. The so called classic \"light bulb sign\", which is homogeneous high signal intensity on T2W-image\\ns is seen in 65% of cases [4]. Imaging pitfalls Because of these pitfalls diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is based on a combination of imaging features and is often supplemented by nu\\nclear medicine imaging findings and biochemical confirmation. 10% tumor? Pheochromocytomas have been called the \"10% tumor\" because it was considered that 10% were malignant, 10% bi\\nlateral, 10% familial, 10 % extra-adrenal and 10% occurred in children. It has now become clear, however, that actually more than 30% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are inh\\nerited [18]. Moreover, the percentage of tumors that are bilateral, extra-adrenal, pediatric or malignant differ with each specific hereditary syndrome [18]. Associated familial syn\\ndromes are multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type IIA/B, von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type I, familial paragangliomas caused by SDH-gene mutations, Sturge-Weber syndrome an\\nd Carney triad [5, 18]. 10 - 49% of pheochromocytomas are incidentally discovered in asymptomatic patients. The radiologist should therefore have a low threshold in considering the \\ndiagnosis of a pheochromocytoma. The biochemical diagnosis is made by measurement of plasma free or urinary fractionated metanephrines[2,18]. Unnecessary and potentially dangerous b\\niopsy has to be avoided. Myelolipomas\\nMyelolipomas:\\nAdrenal myelolipomas are benign, relatively rare (0,08-0,2%) tumors that contain variable amounts of bone marrow elements and mature fat. Myelolipomas are usually asymptomatic, unle\\nss they are very large (due to mass effect) or bleed [5]. The presence of macroscopic fat makes them easy to recognize on CT or MRI. Attenuation on nonenhanced CT will be well below\\n 0 HU. At MR imaging the fatty portions will be hyperintense on non fat-saturated T1-weighted images and show signal dropout on fat-saturated T1 or T2-weighted images. Calcification\\ns are seen in approximately 24% of cases. Axial and coronal image showing a large right myelolipoma with bleeding. The image on the right is a follow-up scan.\\nCysts:\\nHere a small cyst is seen on CT and on a T2W-image. Images show unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT of a cyst. The cyst is thin-walled, homogeneous and does not show any enhancement\\n.\\nAdrenocortical carcinoma:\\nAdrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are rare aggressive tumors with an incidence of approximately 1-2 per million per year [5]. 60% of ACCs are functioning. Cushing\\'s syndrome alone or\\n a mixed Cushing\\'s and virilisation syndrome are the most common presentation. Virilisation, feminisation or hyperaldosteronism alone is rare (< 10%). Patients with nonfunctioning a\\ndrenocortical carcinomas usually present with abdominal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal fullness, flank or back pain due to the large size of the tumor. Adrenocortical car\\ncinomas may be sporadic or associated with hereditary syndromes, including MEN1, Lynch syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Peak incidences are in early c\\nhildhood and in the fourth and fifth decade of life [5]. Typical imaging features of adrenocortical carcinomas are [5,10]: Imaging pittfalls: More than half of ACC patients have sta\\nge III or IV disease at the time of diagnosis, which explains the dismal prognosis of this diagnosis, with 5-year survival of 50% for stage III, and 15% for stage IV. So, it is impo\\nrtant to look for adjacent organ invasion, and for lymph node and distant metastases, most commonly in lung, liver or bone. Here a typical example of an adrenocortical carcinoma. Th\\ne tumor is bulky and shows heterogeneous enhancement. Note the \\'stellar\\' central hypodensity. There is capsular enhancement. Small adrenocortical carcinomas have less typical featur\\nes, but also enhance inhomogeneously. Also note the dystrophic calcifications and areas of necrosis (red arrows).

Here a large right adrenal adrenal carcinoma with extensive abdominal and mediastinal para-aortic lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis. Atypical adeno\\nma\\nAtypical adenomas:\\nLesions are considered atypical for adenoma if they show: The following lesions were all resected because of large size, indeterminate radiological features or interval growth. Here\\n a 68 mm right hyperenhancing adrenal lesion with small calcifications and cystic spots, uncharacteristic for an adenoma. Atypical adenoma with a post hemorrhagic pseudocyst This is\\n an enlarged left adrenal gland with a 6,4 cm well encapsulated hypodense, possibly cystic lesion, but with a density >10 HU. Histology showed an adenoma with a post hemorrhagic pse\\nudocyst. Atypical adenoma with hyperdense strands as a result of internal bleeding The image shows a 7,6 cm left adrenal lesion with density < 0 HU, but with hyperdense strands. On \\nhistology, this was shown to be due to internal bleeding in an adenoma. Atypical adenoma with no signal drop and heterogeneous enhancement. These images are of a very atypical large\\n adenoma. There is no signal drop on the opposed phase image. The post contrast image shows heterogeneous enhancement. On resection this proved to be an adenoma, however.\\nPitfalls fatty lesions:\\nOncocytoma of the left adrenal with fatty components. Macroscopic fat is fairly specific for myelolipomas, but has also been described uncommonly in adenomas, adrenal teratomas, met\\nastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and even adrenocortical carcinoma. If the macroscopic fat content exceeds 50%, the diagnosis of adrenal myelolipoma can be \\nconfidently made [4]. It is safe to follow-up incidentally discovered, asymptomatic adrenal myelolipomas. Usually they are resected when they are larger than 7 cm, symptomatic (mass\\n effect, pain), hormonally active or complicated by bleeding [5]. The image shows a fat-containing adrenal lesion, which is well-demarcated and contains soft tissue, fatty component\\ns and some calcifications. This lesion was removed because of its large size of 13 cm and uncertain origin. It turned out to be an oncocytoma with fatty and myeloid metaplasia. This\\n is another very large adrenal lesion of uncertain origin with macroscopic fat and dystrophic calcifications. This proved to be a liposarcoma with osteosarcomatous differentiation.\\nMRI protocol:\\nMRI is usually deployed as a problem solver after inconclusive CT or if contrast enhanced CT is contra-indicated. MRI protocol should include [4,5]: DWI has no added value due to co\\nnsiderable overlap in ADC values between benign and malignant adrenal lesions [11]. Most radiologists use visual evaluation to determine whether there is signal drop on out-of-phase\\n images. However, it is also possible to measure the change in signal intensity within a ROI placed over the adrenal lesion on the out-of-phase image and compare this to the in-phas\\ne image, using the spleen as internal reference organ. Either the adrenal-to-spleen ratio (ASR) or the adrenal signal intensity index (SI-index) may be calculated by using the Adren\\nal MRI calculator [12,13]. An ASR <0.71 and SI-index >16.5% indicate an adrenal adenoma. The reported sensitivity for ASR is 58 - 99% and the specificity is 84-86%. Chemical shift i\\nmaging is less sensitive than washout CT for detecting lipid-poor adenomas, in particular when unenhanced CT density is 20 HU or higher [13]. This adrenal lesion was discovered on a\\n pulmonary embolism scan. Using the Adrenal MRI calculator the adrenal spleen ratio (ASR) and signal intensity index (SI-index) can be measured from ROIs placed inside the adrenal l\\nesion and the spleen on both the in-phase and out-of-phase images. Based on the signal intensities measured within ROIs placed over the adrenal lesion and spleen the ASR is 0,66 (< \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 381}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"0,71) and and the SII is 39,5% (> 16,5%), indicating that this is an adenoma.\\nPET-CT:\\nFDG - Nonspecific adrenal tumor imaging:\\nMalignant tumors have higher glucose metabolism than benign tumors. This enables PET-CT imaging with the glucose analogue 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG). FDG is not specific for any\\n certain adrenal tumor, but can be used to differentiate pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, adrenocortical carcinomas and adrenal metastases from benign tumors. Axial venous phase C\\nT in mediastinal and bone window setting Images depict mediastinal and bone window setting of a patient with a bulky heterogeneously enhancing right adrenal tumor. This was proven t\\no be an adrenocortical carcinoma. There is a faint, ill-defined liver lesion in segment 6 and there are non-specific sclerotic changes in the body of T12. Continue with the PET-imag\\ne... PET-CT performed for complete staging shows intense uptake in the adrenal tumor, indicative of its malignant nature. There is also intense uptake in two liver metastases and in\\n a bone metastasis in T12. Approximately 20-40% of patients with an adrenocortical carcinoma present with metastases at diagnosis. Whole-body FDG PET-CT can distinguish benign from \\nmalignant lesions with high sensitivity (100%), but with lower specificity (87- 97%). False positives are due to a small number of adenomas, pheochromocytomas, inflammatory and infe\\nctious lesions, that mimic malignant lesions [14]. Possible false negatives are hemorrhagic, necrotic or small (5-10 mm) metastases and metastases from relatively low FDG-avid prima\\nry cancers, like minimally invasive adenocarcinoma or carcinoid tumors [14]. Apart from visual evaluation it is also possible to use standardized uptake values (SUVs) with a certain\\n cut-off value (SUVmax 2,68-3.7) or an adrenal-to-liver SUV ratio (reported cutoff values 1.29-1.45) to differentiate benign from malignant adrenal lesions, with high sensitivity an\\nd specificity [14, 15]. Combining FDG PET-CT and adrenal washout CT can further improve the accuracy for diagnosing adrenal malignancy [16]. This axial venous CT shows a very bulky \\nright adrenal mass, suspicious for a malignancy, based on the large size and heterogeneity. This lesion is an adrenocortical carcinoma, but in contrast to the former example, subseq\\nuent FDG PET-CT performed for staging purposes showed only mild uptake and only in the most avidly enhancing part of the tumor. Most adrenocortical carcinomas show intense FDG-uptak\\ne. This lack of FDG-avidity might be due to a lower grade tumor with lower mitotic rate or large hemorrhagic or necrotic components. First postoperative axial venous phase CT perfor\\nmed 3 months after left adrenalectomy for a large adrenocortical carcinoma showing an enhancing nodule posterior to the left kidney. Restaging FDG PET-CT showed intense uptake in on\\nly this lesion, which proved to be a metastasis on subsequent follow-up imaging. The left renal subcapsular hematoma is unrelated.\\nPheochromocytoma-specific imaging:\\nAxial arterial and venous phase CT show a hypervascular left-sided adrenal incidentaloma. Plasma free metanephrines were elevated, diagnostic of a pheochromocytoma. Further staging \\nincluded a MIBG SPECT and a FDG PET-CT, which both showed intense uptake in the left adrenal tumor, but no evidence of metastatic disease. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas origi\\nnate from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. These are neuroendocrine cells that express cell membrane norepinephrine transporters and secrete catecholamines, noradrenaline, d\\nopamine and a few other hormones. This is the basis for the use of tracers like 131I- and 123I-MIBG, which accumulate within adrenergic tissue, making MIBG scanning specific for phe\\nochromocytomas and paragangliomas. 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 18F-fluorodopamine (DA) are 18F-labeled pheochromocytoma-specific compounds which can be used for PET-CT ima\\nging [19]. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas also have somatostatin receptors and thus can be imaged using somatostatin analogues. The somatostatin scan (or Octreoscan) is now be\\ning replaced more and more by PET-CT using 68 gallium-labeled somatostatin analogues like DOTA-TOC, DOTA-NOC or DOTA-TATE [19]. The axial venous phase CT on the left shows a large i\\nnhomogeneously enhancing right adrenal lesion with a small cyst, which could not be diagnosed as an adenoma with CT washout, making it an indeterminate lesion. The plasma free metan\\nephrines were elevated and the lesion was diagnosed as a pheochromocytoma. MIBG SPECT for staging showed intense uptake in only the right adrenal gland. PET-CT was also performed, w\\nhich in contrast showed uptake only slightly higher than normal liver. This is highly unusual for pheochromocytomas, which are usually very FDG-avid, even when they are benign. If t\\nhe primary tumor lacks FDG uptake, the sensitivity for finding metastases on an FDG PET-CT will be very low. The upper left image is a venous phase screening CT in a patient with a \\nknown SDHD-gene mutation which is associated with a high risk for developing pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. There is a hypervascular right adrenal tumor. A MIBG SPECT was per\\nformed, which showed intense uptake, helping to confirm the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma. A year later, screening was performed with 68 Ga- DOTATATE PET-CT. This shows intense up\\ntake in the right adrenal gland, but also intense uptake in a glomus caroticum tumor on the left as seen on the coronal MIP to the right. The DOTATATE uptake in the spleen and pitui\\ntary gland are normal, as is the normal excretion by the kidneys to the bladder. Pheochromocytomas express somatostatin receptors, making them suitable for imaging with a somatostat\\nin-analogue. In this case 68 gallium-labeled DOTATOC is used. This patient presented with widespread metastatic disease to the lungs, liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodes after res\\nection of a pheochromocytoma. Continue with the PET-CT... PET-CT of the same patient with 68 gallium-labeled DOTATOC.\\nEndocrine evaluation:\\nUp to 15% of all adrenal tumors are functional: Current guidelines from the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the\\n American College of Radiology (ACR) [2,3] recommend an initial biochemical evaluation of all adrenal incidentalomas to exclude pheochromocytoma, subclinical Cushing's syndrome and \\nhyperaldosteronism. The following hormones should be assessed in all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma: The following hormones should be assessed conditionally : sex hormones a\\nnd steroid precursors in patients with suspected ACC.

Although there is a relatively limited differential diagnosis, pathology\\n nevertheless varies between congenital, benign, primary malignant and\\n metastatic disease. This article summarizes\\n the typical imaging features of the differential diagnostic considerations of large airway diseases and hopefully serves as a reference for those that need it every now and\\n then.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe central airways consist of the\\ntrachea and main bronchi, before the airways branch towards the periphery into\\nthe lobar, segmental and subsegmental airways on both sides. The trachea has a length of about 10-15 cm and has an extrathoracic and\\nintrathoracic component. It contains about 15-20 horseshoe shaped cartilaginous\\nrings. \\nThe posterior wall of the trachea and main bronchi is membranous and\\ndoes not contain cartilage, which is important for the imaging differential\\ndiagnosis, as will be discussed later. The inner lining of the airways consists\\nof respiratory ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells, minor\\nsalivary glands and neuro-endocrine cells. \\nFurthermore, the airways contain\\nmuscle tissue, cartilage, nerves, etc. \\nAll of which may give rise to pathology.\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\nCentral airway\\npathology can be divided into subgroups, either by etiology (ie. inflammatory,\\nneoplastic, etc.) or by imaging appearance (ie. nodular, single/multifocal, diffuse\\ninfiltration, etc.). In the table an overview based on\\ndisease etiology subgroups to provide a comprehensive overview. This is a flow-chart that is based on imaging appearances, which can be used to narrow down the differential diagnosi\\ns.\\nNodular - differential:\\nNodular\\nlesions protrude into the lumen and distort the smooth inner contour of the\\nairway. \\nOnly a minority of these lesions will have specific morphologic\\nfeatures. \\nHere some examples of nodular or mass lesions in the trachea and\\nbronchi.\\nWall thickening - differential:\\nAt the site\\nof involvement there is loss of the normal smooth and thin contour of the\\ntracheal and bronchial wall. \\nOnly a few diseases have specific morphologic\\nfeatures. \\nHere some examples of both focal and diffuse central airway wall\\nthickening.\\nIatrogenic:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 383}),\n",

Typically, a subglottic\\nstenosis near the thoracic inlet is seen with an hourglass shape in the coronal\\nplane, due to a short segment of focal scarring in the trachea (figure). Bronchoscopy images from above and below the\\nlevel of the vocal cords, show a significant subglottic narrowing of the trachea.\\nRadiotherapy:\\nWhen applied to tumors in proximity to\\nthe central airways radiotherapy can cause airway narrowing, fistula, necrosis and sometimes massive hemoptysis. \\nIn addition mediastinal fatty\\ninfiltration and esophageal wall thickening may be present in the acute phase. Image\\nWall thickening of the trachea bifurcation post-radiotherapy.\\nForeign body:\\nAspiration of a foreign body is rare in adults, and most often encountered in children.\\nAmong adults aspiration of dental parts is relatively common, especially in the trauma population.

Over the course of 14 days \\nthe corpus luteum degenerates, leaving the small scarred corpus albicans. Graafian follicles Graafian follicles The normal ovary in pre-menopausal women contains small cysts. The im\\nages show two normal ovaries with several anechoic, simple cysts consistent with Graafian follicles. On T2-weighted MR-images the Graafian follicles are seen as bright cysts surroun\\nded by darker solid ovarian stroma. FDG-PET pitfall - normal premenopausal ovaries In some pre-menopausal women the normal ovaries may be avidly PET positive, depending on the date \\nin the menstrual cycle. Because in pre-menopausal women a PET-positive ovary may be either an adnexal neoplasm or completely normal, it is important to be aware of the possibility o\\nf physiologic mid-cycle FDG uptake and to correlate this finding with the clinical history. FDG-PET in pre-menopausal women should therefore preferably be scheduled in the first wee\\nk of the menstrual cycle. In post-menopausal women, the normal ovaries show only minimal uptake of FDG. Any increased ovarian FDG uptake in this age group is suspicious for a possib\\nle neoplasm. LEFT: Postmenopausal woman. The ovary is a T2 dark tissue clump near the proximal end of the round ligament.RIGHT: T2 dark left ovary devoid of follicles. It is a bit p\\nrominent, but is still likely to be normal\\nPost-menopausal:\\nPost-menopause is defined as 1 year or more of amenorrhea. In Western countries the average age of menopause is 51-53 years. In post-menopausal women the ovaries are generally small\\ner and gradually stop forming Graafian follicles. Note, however, that follicular cysts may persist several years after menopause. In the coronal T2-weighted image of a postmenopausa\\nl woman the ovary is no more than a dark tissue clump near the proximal end of the round ligament. The axial T2-weighted image also shows a dark left ovary, devoid of follicles. Alt\\nhough a bit prominent, this is likely to be completely normal. Only if, by chance, there happened to be prior imaging showing that the lesion was growing, your differential diagnosi\\ns would start with a benign solid lesion such as ovarian fibroma or fibrothecoma.\\nFunctional cysts:\\nBy far the most common cystic ovarian lesions are benign functional ovarian cysts. Functional cysts are Graafian follicles or corpora lutea that have grown too large or have bled, b\\nut are otherwise benign. In the early post-menopause phase, 1-5 years after the final menstrual period, sporadic ovulatory cycles still may occur and ovarian cysts may be seen. Even\\n in late menopause, which is defined as more than 5 years since the final menstrual period, when ovulation is unlikely to occur, small simple cysts may be seen in up to 20% of women\\n.\\nFollicular cyst:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 389}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"A dominant Graafian follicle sometimes fails to ovulate and does not involute. When it becomes larger than 3 cm, it is called a follicular cyst. Follicular cysts are usually 3-8 cm,\\n but may become much larger. On ultrasound follicular cysts present as simple unilocular, anechoic cysts with a thin, smooth wall. There should be no enhancing nodules or other soli\\nd components, no enhancing septations, and no more than physiologic ascites. Follicular cysts will usually resolve spontaneously on follow-up.\\nCorpus luteum cyst:\\nA corpus luteum may seal and fill with fluid or blood, forming a corpus luteum cyst. The transvaginal ultrasound images show a small complex ovarian cyst with wall vascularity on po\\nwer Doppler analysis. The characteristic circular Doppler appearance is called the 'ring of fire'. Note, there is good through-transmission and no internal vascularity, consistent w\\nith a, partially involuted, corpus luteum cyst. Remember that women who are on birth control pills usually won't form a corpus luteum, as birth control pills prevent ovulation. On t\\nhe other hand, use of fertility drugs that induce ovulation, increases the chance of developing corpus luteum cysts. Corpus luteum cyst Another case with the typical the 'ring of fi\\nre' on ultrasound. At pathologic examination the collapsed bloody cyst can be clearly seen. Corpus luteum cyst Corpus luteum cyst at MRI: an axial T2-weighted image demonstrating an\\n involuting corpus luteum cyst (arrow). This is a normal finding. The right ovary is also normal. Hemorrhagic cyst with a clot mimicking a neoplasm. Notice absence of flow and good \\nthrough-transmission\\nHemorrhagic ovarian cyst:\\nWhen a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. On ultrasound hemorrhagic ovarian cyst presents as an unilocular thin-walled \\ncyst with fibrin-strands or low-level echoes and good through transmission. On MRI hemorrhagic cysts are bright on pre-contrast T1-FatSat, and dark on T2. There should be no interna\\nl vascularity on Doppler ultrasound or internal enhancement on CT or MRI. Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts have variable wall thickness, and often some circumferential vascularity can be s\\neen. Clinically the classic presentation is with acute pain. However HOC can also be an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst The ultrasound images\\n show multiple simple and one complex right ovarian lesion (red arrow). The latter demonstrates diffuse low-level echos and no flow on Doppler. Note that there is a good through tra\\nnsmission (blue arrow). These findings indicate the presence of a hemorrhagic cyst. Continue with the MR-images. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst Axial and sagittal T2W images from the same\\n patient. The right ovary contains multiple simple T2 bright cysts with thin borders and no solid components. On the axial image there is one lesion, that is dark on T2, i.e. a comp\\nlex cyst (arrow). There is a small amount of ascites around the right ovary, but not enough to raise concern of a possible neoplasm. On the T1-weighted image without fatsat the comp\\nlex cyst is bright, indicating either fat or blood content. On the T1-weighted image with fatsat the lesion remains bright, ruling out a fatty lesion. After the administration of Gd\\n there is no enhancement, confirming that this is a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. An endometrioma would be in your differential. Note that subtraction images are best to demonstrate the\\n lack of enhancement in a lesion, that is bright on the pre-contrast T1-weighted image. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in both right and left ovary The ultrasound images show the right an\\nd left ovary: on both sides there is what appears to be a solid lesion. There is however good through transmission, which indicates that we are probably dealing with hemorrhagic cys\\nts. On Doppler US (not shown) there was no vascularity. Continue with the MR examination. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst On an axial T1-weighted image both lesions are bright indicating f\\nat, blood or high protein fluid. Fat saturation does not suppress the signal in these lesions. In an image with overall reasonably good fat suppression this rules out a fat-containi\\nng teratoma and confirms the suggestion of hemorrhagic fluid. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. Left:image without subtraction. Right: image with subtraction. On the axial T2-weighted image\\n both lesions show typical 'shading'. The gradual drop in T2 is thought to be caused by a combination of increasing viscosity and increasing concentration of protein and iron toward\\ns the dependent portion of the lesion. There is no enhancement on the subtraction image (Post-Gd minus Pre-Gd). Again, subtraction is useful in cases like this: Gd-induced signal in\\ncrease over the already very bright pre-contrast image would be very hard to appreciate otherwise.\\nOther benign cystic and cyst-like lesions:\\nVaginal ultrasound showing a large hypoechoic cystic lesion with diffuse low-level echo's\\nEndometrioma:\\nCystic endometriosis or endometrioma is a type of cyst formed when endometrial tissue grows in the ovaries. It affects women during the reproductive years and may cause chronic pelv\\nic pain associated with menstruation. The ovaries are involved in approximately 75% of patients with endometriosis. On ultrasound endometrioma can be variable but the great majority\\n (about 95%) of patients present with a classic homogeneous, hypoechoic cyst with diffuse low level echoes. Rarely it is anechoic, mimicking a functional ovarian cyst. Endometriomas\\n can be multilocular and have thin or even thick septations. Transvaginal ultrasound: endometrioma with two hyperechoic wall foci, consistent with cholesterol deposits (arrows) In a\\nbout one third of patients, on careful examination, small echogenic foci can be seen adhering to the wall. These have been postulated to be cholesterol deposits, but may also consti\\ntute small blood clots or debris. It is important to differentiate these foci from true wall nodules. In the presence of these foci, the diagnosis of an endometrioma is very likely.\\n The transvaginal ultrasound shows a typical endometrioma, with hyperechoic wall foci. At Doppler US no vascularity was seen in these foci (not shown). The next case is a transvagin\\nal US-image that shows a cystic lesion with a hyperechoic structure. There is a wide differential diagnosis including ovarian cystic neoplasm with solid component, mature cystic ter\\natoma with hyperechoic Rokitansky nodule, hemorrhagic cyst with clot and endometrioma with clot or debris. Continue with the CT and MR. Endometrioma A CT was requested that turned o\\nut to show the same, predominantly cystic lesion. If additional imaging is needed for cysts that are indeterminate at ultrasound, it is better to perform MRI. The T2-weighted image \\non the right correlates nicely with the ultrasound image. On T2-weighted images endometriomas typically show 'shading'. LEFT: Gd-enhanced T1-weighted image with fatsat. RIGHT: Subtr\\naction image. MRI confirms the absence of any enhancement, confirming that it is most likely debris within the cyst. On MRI the hemorrhagic content will make endometrioma appear bri\\nght on T1-weighted images. On T1-fatsat images an endometrioma will remain bright. This in contrast to teratomas, that are also bright on T1 but dark on T1-fatsat images. Always inc\\nlude a T1 fat suppressed sequence, because this makes small T1 bright lesions more conspicuous. Endometrioma The next case is a unilocular, mildly hypoechoic ovarian lesion with thr\\nough transmission. There is no internal or wall vascularity on Doppler. On ultrasound this can again either be a hemorrhagic cyst or an endometrioma. Continue with the MR images End\\nometrioma 6 months later a follow-up MRI was performed. The lesions are bright on T1-weighted images. The bright signal persists on fat saturation indicating the presence of blood. \\nThere is T2 shading consistent with a hemorrhagic lesion. There is no enhancement. The fluid-fluid level in the right ovarian lesion also confirms its cystic nature. The fact that t\\nhe lesions persist after 6 months makes bilateral endometrioma much more likely than hemorrhagic cysts. Axial MR demonstrating characteristic 'string-of-pearls' appearance\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome:\\nThe Poly-Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Imaging can confirm or suggest the diagnosis. Imaging criteria: These patients usually have menstrua\\nl cycle irregularities and either typical clinical signs of hirsutism, obesity, infertility, acne, male balding pattern or biochemically show increased androgen levels.

In this patient, MRI confirmed the diagnosis of PCOS.\\n Theca lutein cysts. The septations do not show enhancement on Doppler evaluation.\\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome - Theca lutein cysts:\\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a relatively rare condition.

It can also be seen in pregnancy, but seldom in a normal single pregnancy. If it does occ\\nur in normal pregnancies, the reported natural course is spontaneous resolution after birth. In normal pregnancies the reported natural course is spontaneous resolution after birth.\\n Hormonal overstimulation more often occurs in molar pregnancy, erythroblastosis fetalis or in plural pregnancies. On imaging there is - usually bilateral - ovarian enlargement with\\n multiloculated cyst that can totally replace the ovary. The clinical history is the distinguishing feature to make the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Theca lutein \\ncysts: US images of a young pregnant woman. In both ovaries there are multiple cysts. Right image shows an invasive uterine mass, consistent with invasive molar pregnancy. The US im\\nages are of a young pregnant woman, who had multiple ovarian cysts. The other ovary is not shown but showed a similar appearance. The features needed to make the diagnosis of ovaria\\nn hyperstimulation syndrome are in the clinical history - a young pregnant woman - and in the last image of the uterus, which shows an invasive uterine mass, consistent with invasiv\\ne molar pregnancy.\\nPID with tubo-ovarian abscess:\\nTubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) usually arises as a complication of Chlamydia or Gonorrhoeae infection that rises from the vagina or cervix to the fallopian tubes. On imaging a thick-wal\\nled complex cystic ovarian lesion is seen with abundant flow. The presence of a thickened endometrium or hydrosalphinx makes the diagnosis of a PID more likely. The axial CECT image\\n shows a left complex cystic lesion with thick enhancing walls and internal gas. It looks like an abscess. Note the relatively unremarkable aspect of the overlying mesentery: this i\\ns unlikely to be a peri-diverticular abscess. Continue with the reconstructed images. On the sagittal image notice, that the lesion is connected to the ovarian vein confirming that \\nthis is an ovarian lesion (arrow). The coronal image shows the anatomic connection to the uterus. There is a gasbubble in the uterine cavity, which confirms the suggestion of an inf\\nection rising from the uterine cavity via the salphinx to involve the ovary (click or tap the image to enlarge).\\nBenign cystic ovarian neoplasms:\\nMature cystic teratoma with a Rokitansky nodule or dermoid plug\\nMature cystic teratoma:\\nA very common benign ovarian lesion that may appear cystic is a mature cystic teratoma, also called dermoid cyst. Mature in this context means benign, as opposed to the immature, ma\\nlignant teratoma. Benign cystic teratomas typically occur in young women of child-bearing age. At imaging they are usually unilocular (up to 90%) but can be multilocular, and are bi\\nlateral in ~15%. Up to 60% may contain calcifications. The cystic component is fluid fat, produced by sebaceous glands in cyst lining. The presence of fat is diagnostic. The charact\\neristic ultrasound appearance is that of a cystic mass, with a hyperechoic solid mural nodule, which is called a Rokitansky nodule or dermoid plug (figure). Tip-of-the-iceberg sign \\nIn another case the transvaginal ultrasound shows the 'tip-of-the-iceberg' sign: acoustic shadowing from the hyperechoic part of the dermoid cyst. This may be misinterpreted as bowe\\nl gas and the lesion may be overlooked. A fat-fluid level may be present, caused by fat floating on more aqueous fluid. Multiple thin, echogenic lines or stripes may be seen, caused\\n by hair floating in the cyst cavity. Mature cystic teratomas, even though benign, are often resected because of increased risk of ovarian torsion, the most commonly associated comp\\nlication. Other complications associated with teratoma are infection, rupture (spontaneous or trauma) and, rarely, hemolytic anemia (resolves with resection). Malignant transformati\\non can occur but is also rare ( Axial T1-weighted image in the same patient shows a bright lesion with an internal septation. A septation is seen in about 10% of thse lesions. On th\\ne T1-weighted image with fat suppression there is suppression of the signal. This confirms the fatty content and is diagnostic of a teratoma. Classic low attenuation consistent with\\n fat in a right sided cystic teratoma at CT.\\nCystadenoma and cystadenofibroma:\\nCystadenoma and cystadenofibroma are also common benign ovarian tumors. They can be either serous or mucinous. At imaging a serous cystadenoma is most often unilocular and anechoic,\\n and may look like a simple cyst. Mucinous cystadenomas are most often multilocular with thin (\\nThe locules may contain complex fluid, due to proteinaceous debris or hemorrhage, or both. The finding of papillary projections should raise the suspicion of a possible borderline m\\nalignancy or a cystadenocarcinoma. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a 5.1x5.2-cm dominant left ovarian cyst. The cyst is anechoic and no septations are seen. Also there is no ascites. \\nThere is, however, a nodule on the posterior wall that shows no flow on Doppler. This may be a follicular cyst with some debris, but a cystic neoplasm cannot be excluded. Work-up wi\\nth MRI is recommended. T2-weighted image of the same patient shows thin enhancing septations (as well as motion artifacts that should not be mistaken for septations). There are no t\\numor nodules and no adenopathy or peritoneal deposits. There is only a small amount of ascites. This proved to be a cystadenoma. The next case is another cystic lesion On the poster\\nior wall a solid mural nodule is found, which is avascular. No secondary signs of malignancy. Continue with the MRI. Five years later the lesion has grown. Axial T2 shows a complex \\ncystic left ovarian lesion, with a solid nodule on the posterior wall. At post-contrast axial T1W-FatSat the thin septa and the mural nodule show slight enhancement. On the basis of\\n these findings the distinction between a benign ovarian lesion such as a cystadenofibroma and a malignant lesion cannot be made. The lesion was resected and was found to be a cysta\\ndenofibroma. The next case is a transabdominal ultrasound that shows a left-sided multiloculated cystic mass. This looks like a cystic ovarian neoplasm but no ovary could be identif\\nied. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images CT of the same patient shows a multi-loculated cystic mass adjacent to the bladder, connected to the left ovarian vein (arrow). There are th\\nick septations and irregular wall thickening. On the basis of this CT the distinction between a benign ovarian lesion such as as cystadenofibroma and a malignant ovarian lesion cann\\not be made. The lesion was resected and found to be a cystadenofibroma.\\nMalignant cystic ovarian neoplasms:\\nRemember, the role of imaging is not to determine the histological nature of a lesion, but to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and guide decisions on further management. Th\\ne examples given here serve as a demonstration of suspicious imaging features, not as a guide for determination of histologic lesion type.\\nSerous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma:\\nUltrasound shows a complex solid-cystic mass in the left ovary, and another, very large complex solid-cystic mass in the right hemi-pelvis. CT of the same patient shows a complex so\\nlid-cystic mass with thick, enhancing septations in the right ovary. These findings are very suspicious for a malignant cystic neoplams. There is also bilateral lymphadenopathy (arr\\nows). Pathology showed a serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma. This is the most common type of ovarian cancer.\\nMucinous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma:\\nUltrasound shows a very large multi-loculated cystic lesion in the region of the right adnex. Some locules are anechoic. Others contain uniform low-level echoes, consistent with pro\\nteineous content, such as hemorrhage or, in this case, mucin. The septations are thin, except for the dorsal septations that appear somewhat thicker, partially caused by the lower s\\ncanresolution at great depth.\\nThe septations are avascular.\\nThere are no solid components.\\nThere was no ascites.

The CECT shows similar findings.\\nThe locules are of different attenuation, consistent with varying protein content. There is no ascites orperitoneal deposits and no lymphadenopathy. At pathology this was a mucinous\\n cystadenocarcinoma of low malignant potential. Specimen of the mucinous cystadenocarcinoma The thin, relatively avascular septae, the absence of frank solid components, the absence\\n of ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis and the absence of invasion, suggest a lesion of low malignant potential (LMP). Note however, that this diagnosis can not be made on imagin\\ng findings alone. Especially the absence of invasion in ovarian stroma cannot be judged reliably on imaging.\\nEndometrioid ovarian carcinoma:\\nOn ultrasound both ovaries are markedly enlarged and contain cystic components with intracystic solid components (arrows). The complex solid-cystic lesions, in addition to being bil\\nateral, are suspicious for a cystic ovarian neoplasm and warrant further evaluation. Again, the role of imaging is to confirm a lesion is present and to decide that this is not a le\\nsion that can be classified as definitely benign nor a lesion that can be safely followed-up: action is required. CT of the same patient confirms large bilateral complex solid-cysti\\nc lesions, bulging into the abdomen. The purpose of the CT is not to confirm what was already known from the ultrasound, but to stage disease. On the basis of CT (or of MRI) it is n\\not possible to determine the histologic type of the tumor. This is not relevant. This patient will undergo surgery. For epithelial tumors - by far the most common group of malignant\\n ovarian tumors - even after surgery, the exact tumor subtype is much less important for the prognosis than factors such as FIGO-stage, tumor differentation grade, and how succesful\\n surgery was in removing all of the disease. For this patient the relevant findings are on the image on the left. There is a peritoneal implant. The tumor was resected and pathology\\n showed this was an endometrioid ovarian carcinoma.\\nCystic metastases to the ovaries:\\nWhile metastases to the ovary are most commonly solid - such as for example Krukenbergs metastases - cystic ovarian metastases do occur. The CT image shows complex cystic masses in \\nboth ovaries. While a serous cystadenocarcinoma may very well be bilateral, they are more often unilocular than multilocular. Barely visible is part of a circumferential colorectal \\ncancer (blue arrow). Clearly visible are cystic implants on the peritoneal reflection (red arrow).\\nThese were cystic ovarian metastases of a colorectal cancer.\\nThis is an uncommon finding. by Deborah Levine et al September 2010 Radiology, 256, 943-954.\\n2.

Secondly we have to realize that any loculated fluid collection due to infe\\nction, i.e. abscess or as a result of pancreatitis, perforation or bile peritonitis can simulate a cystic mass. Especially fluid collections in the lesser sac can simulate a cystic \\nmass. Lastly we have to know which cystic masses are common and look for specific features of these masses. Other mesenteric cysts like enteric duplication cyst, enteric cyst, nonpa\\nncreatic pseudocyst and mesothelial cyst are very uncommon and have no specific features.\\n* Peritoneal inclusion cyst\\n is a less common benign primary peritoneal tumor. \\nIt is also known as benign multicystic mesothelioma.

Usually these metastases arise from mucinous carcinomas of the ovary or of the gastrointesti\\nnal tract (stomach, colon, pancreas). The prognosis is poor. However, when low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix spreads to the peritoneal cavity, the consequence is typ\\nically pseudomyxoma peritonei, which is a distinct tumor with a better prognosis. In peritoneal carcinomatosis we see tumor nodules along the peritoneal lining (arrow), omental tumo\\nr deposits, and bowel obstruction. Pseudomyxoma peritonei with pronounced scalloping of the liver and almost destruction of the spleen. Notice the calcifications\\nPseudomyxoma peritonei:\\nPseudomyxoma peritonei is the result of a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix, which presents as a mucocele and spreads to the peritoneal cavity. It is a clinical syndrome, char\\nacterized by recurrent and recalcitrant voluminous mucinous ascites due to surface growth on the peritoneum without significant invasion of underlying tissues. A typical feature of \\npseudomyxoma peritonei is scalloped indentation of the surface of the liver and spleen. Unlike peritoneal metastases, there are no tumor nodules. There may be some calcifications. P\\nseudomyxoma peritonei with a little bit of scalloping and a mucocele of the appendix Pseudomyxoma peritonei (2) On the left another case of pseudomyxoma peritonei. There is hardly a\\nny scalloping of the liver. Notice the thickened falciform ligament. There is a mucocele of the appendix (arrow). This finding is only rarely seen. Pseudomyxoma peritonei with thick\\nened mesentery (arrow) On the left another case of pseudomyxoma peritonei. There is compression of the mesentery resulting in a thickened cake-like hyperdense mesentery (arrow). The\\nre are also some calcifications. Pseudomyxoma peritonei is often confused with mucinous carcinomatosis. Unlike carcinomatosis it does not have true omental tumor deposits presenting\\n as omental cake or peritoneal tumor deposits. Lymphangioma\\nMesenteric cyst - Lymphangioma:\\nMesenteric cyst is a descriptive term for any cystic lesion within the mesentery. Usually it is a lymphangioma. Other mesenteric cysts like enteric duplication cyst, enteric cyst, n\\nonpancreatic pseudocyst and mesothelial cyst are very uncommon and have no specific features. Lymphangioma is a benign lesion of vascular origin. Most lymphangiomas are located in t\\nhe neck, but 5% of lymphangiomas are abdominal. Lymphangioma has enhancing septa. Unlike in cystic peritoneal metastases, ascites is not a feature of lymphangioma. When you see a se\\nptated cystic lesion without ascites the most likely diagnosis is a lymphangioma. Lymphangioma Lymphangioma is often closely associated with the small bowel. At surgery it is usuall\\ny very difficult to separate the tumor from the bowel and in many cases the bowel also has to be resected. The case on the left is also a lymphangioma. Notice that CT does not alway\\ns appreciate the septations, although the specimen clearly shows multiple septations. Ultrasound or MR depict these septations better than CT. Enteric Duplication Cyst\\nEnteric Duplication Cyst:\\nEnteric duplication cyst is a cyst with a wall that has all three layers of the bowel wall, i.e. mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria. Although we commonly think of duplication \\ncysts when we see a cystic mass adjacent to the bowel, we have to realize, that these are rare lesions.\\nThey may occur anywhere in the mesentery, so either adjacent to or away from the bowel. On the left an enteric duplication cyst. It is located in the transverse mesocolon. This pati\\nent was suspected of having a cystic pancreatic tumor. The specimen demonstrates all the bowel wall layers.\\nNonpancreatic Pseudocyst:\\nNonpancreatic pseudocyst is a residual of an old hematoma or infection. Most of these patients have a history of prior abdominal trauma. Often there is a thickened wall and there ca\\nn be some debris within the lesion. The patient on the left had had a car accident eight months before. This is probably an old mesenteric hematoma as a result of a lap belt injury.\\n Notice the thickened wall on the CT and the debris on the ultrasound. On the left a specimen and CT image of a nonpancreatic pseudocyst. Notice the thick wall. Probably this is an \\nold hematoma or abscess. You can suggest this diagnosis when you have a positive history and you see this thickened wall or debris.\\nEnteric cyst and mesothelial cyst:\\nThese are also mesenteric cysts.\\nThey are rare and have nonspecific imaging features.\\nThe case on the left was diagnosed as a lymohangioma, simply because a lymphangioma is by far the most common mesenteric cyst.\\nAt surgery this was a mesothelial cyst. Peritoneal Inclusion Cyst\\nPeritoneal Inclusion Cyst:\\nAlso called Multilocular peritoneal inclusion cyst or Benign cystic mesothelioma. This is an uncommon benign primary peritoneal tumor that has no relation with the malignant mesothe\\nlioma. It occurs in premenopausal women with prior gynaecological surgery or infection that results in peritoneal scarring. The hormonally active ovaries secrete fluid that becomes \\nloculated in the pelvis. The imaging features of a peritoneal inclusion cyst are non-specific except that it has to be located in the pelvis: On the left a transvaginal ultrasound d\\nemonstrating a multicystic pelvic lesion next to the uterus, which proved to be a peritoneal inclusion cyst. Peritoneal Inclusion Cyst with trapped ovary within septated fluid colle\\nction Sometimes the ovary is seen 'trapped' with the septate fluid collection (figure). Peritoneal inclusion cyst (2) When these peritoneal inclusion cysts become very large, they m\\nay extend into the upper abdomen as is seen in the case on the left.

Peritoneal Inc\\nlusion Cyst Peritoneal inclusion cyst (3) On the left another example of a peritoneal inclusion cyst. There is a nice correlation between the MR and the specimen. Peritoneal inclusi\\non cyst in a man extending into the upper abdomen Peritoneal inclusion cyst (4) On the left images of a male patient, who presented with a lower abdominal mass. There is a multi-cys\\ntic mass extending from the pelvis along the right paracolic gutter to the upper abdomen. In a male patient this is a very uncommon diagnosis. These images look quite similar to ima\\nges of a pseudomyxoma peritonei which was discussed before. In peritoneal inclusion cysts however, you will not see scalloping of the surface of the liver.\\nTuberculosis:\\nTB can produce very thick ascites, that can be loculated in distribution. Because of this, it can simulate a cystic lesion.. Usually there is accompanying abnormality of the termina\\nl ileum and lymphadenopathy. The lymph nodes most often are of low attenuation (caseated). So these are the things to look for. On the left another image of the same patient. In TB \\nthe peritoneum is usually very thick (arrow). Echinococcal cyst with daughter cysts (arrows)\\nEchinococcal Cyst:\\nIt is unusual for an echinococcal cyst to be located in the peritoneum. It favors the liver, the spleen and even the kidney over the peritoneum. On the left we see cysts in the peri\\ntoneum and in the spleen. Notice the daughter cysts as small dark lesions within the large peritoneal cyst (arrows). Echinococcal cysts In the pelvis additional echinococcal cysts a\\nre seen.\\nSolid Masses:\\nOmental cake (arrows) and ascites in a patient with peritoneal metastases\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 393}),\n",

Usually there are omental metastases, i.e. om\\nental cake and ascites. On the left a CT demonstrating omental cake in a patient with ovarian cancer. Metastasis of a lung carcinoma presenting as a solitary solid peritoneal mass O\\nn the left a patient with a lung carcinoma. This solitary solid mass was found in the pelvis. Based on the history this was suspected to be a metastasis. Other solitary solid tumors\\n like ... can have the same presentation. Biopsy is needed to make the diagnosis. This proved to be a metastasis of the lung carcinoma. NHL located in the small bowel mesentery\\nLymphoma:\\nNHL is the most common cause of lymphadenopathy. Usually there are other sites with lymphoma. The CT attenuation at diagnosis is very homogeneous in most cases with minimal to no en\\nhancement. Heterogeneous attenuation is seen only in cases with aggressive histology. During treatment the attenuation becomes heterogeneous as a result of necrosis and fibrosis. Ca\\nlcification may occur. Carcinoid\\nCarcinoid:\\nCarcinoid is a slow-growing neuroendocrine tumour most commonly found in the small bowel. Less than 10% of patients with carcinoid will develop the carcinoid syndrome, caused by the\\n overproduction of serotonin, which can lead to symptoms of cutaneous flushing, diarrhea and bronchoconstriction. Carcinoid metastasizes to the mesentery, which at times is easier t\\no appreciate than the primary tumor in the small bowel. \\nThere is associated bowel wall thickening due to a desmoplastic reaction. On the left a patient with a typical carcinoid with central calcification (blue arrow). Notice the bowel re\\ntraction and wall thickening. There is a metastasis in the liver (yellow arrow). Positive octreoscan in a patient with carcinoid and liver metastases (blue arrows) On the left anoth\\ner patient with a carcinoid. The right image is the octreoscan, which is positive in 85% of carcinoids, so this can be a great help in the differential diagnosis. In this case we ca\\nn also detect liver metastases on the scan (blue arrows). Notice that there is no activity of a primary tumor in the small bowel. This is often the case because the primary tumor ca\\nn be quite small.\\nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumor - GIST:\\nPrimary small bowel tumors can extend into the mesentery and the typical example of that is the GIST. You can have a large mesenteric component and such a small attachment to the bo\\nwel, that you may not appreciate it. On CT they are of mixed density due to necrosis and hemorrhage and they tend to be well vascularized, so they will enhance like the case on the \\nleft.\\nInflammatory Pseudotumor:\\nThis disease can affect lung, orbit and mesentery. Inflammatory pseudotumor is a diagnosis by exclusion. Usually the diagnosis is made at surgery or biopsy. It is the result of chro\\nnic inflammation with an unclear pathogenesis. Probably it is an occult infection due to minor trauma or post surgical. Mesenteric fibromatosis\\nMesenteric fibromatosis - Desmoid:\\nMesenteric fibromatosis is also known as intra-abdominal fibromatosis, abdominal desmoid or desmoid tumor. On the left a 33-year-old man who complains of an increasing abdominal gir\\nth, abdominal fullness, and a palpable abdominal mass. First study the images on the left and continue with the MR. Look for some imaging features that are helpful in the differenti\\nal diagnosis. Mesenteric fibromatosiswith high signal on T2WI First of all this is a well circumscribed lesion with a low density on CT. There is some enhancement around the lesion \\nand there are some small strands of enhancement within the lesion. On MR there is a low signal on T1 as we would expect. On T2 there is relatively high signal. In combination with t\\nhe low density on CT this tells us that there is mucin within the lesion. This finding is very suggestive of the diagnosis of mesenteric fibromatosis. Mesenteric fibromatosis with G\\nadolinium enhancement Mesenteric fibromatosis - Desmoid (2) The enhancement on MR is more intense compared to the enhancement on CT. On CT the low density of the mucin stands out, b\\nut on MR we can appreciate the enhancement better. It tells us that the lesion is well vascularized. Mesenteric fibromatosis with a fibrous stroma Mesenteric fibromatosis or desmoid\\n is a benign proliferative process that is locally aggressive and can recur, but it does not metastasize. The small bowel mesentery is the most common site. 13% of patients have fam\\nilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). On the left images of another patient with mesenteric fibromatosis. Notice that this lesion is not of low attenuation. This lesion has a more coll\\nagenous or fibrous stroma. So there are two distinct patterns. Mesenteric fibromatosis - Desmoid (3) On the left again a more typical case with a low density tumor located in the gr\\neater omentum (upper image) and the gastrosplenic ligament (lower image). Mesenteric fibromatosis arising in the mesentery of a J-pouch in a patient with familial adenomatous polypo\\nsis On the left an unusual location, because normally there is no mesentery deep in the pelvis. This patient had familial adenomatous polyposis. A total colectomy with J-pouch of th\\ne ileum was performed. Now accompanying that J-pouch is mesentery in which mesenteric fibromatosis has developed. Notice the low attenuation foci or bands of myxoid stroma within th\\ne tumor. In familial adenomatous polyposis the mesenteric fibromatosis is almost always post operative and occurs at the operative sites. It frequently occurs at multiple sites incl\\nuding abdominal wall fibromatosis. These cases can be very aggressive. It usually comes back and when it does, it comes back as a more aggressive tumor. Therfore these patients are \\ntreated as conservatively as possible. Panniculitis mesenterialis\\nSclerosing Mesenteritis:\\nThis disease has multiple synonyms reflecting the wide histologic spectrum: mesenteric panniculitis, fibrosing mesenteritis and mesenteric lipodystrophy. Pathologically it is a chro\\nnic inflammation of unknown etiology. This entity is more common than previously thought. The signs and symptoms are variable. Patients present with pain, a palpable mass or bowel c\\nomplications, but in many cases it is an incidental finding on CT made for other reasons. The image on the left is the form that we most frequently see in patients that are screened\\n for other reasons. This form is mostly named panniculitis mesenterialis. In a more advanced stage you can have significant fibrosis resulting in retraction of the small bowel. With\\nin these masses dystrophic calcifications can be seen as well as lucent areas of fat (arrow) Sclerosing mesenteritis (2) On the left a nice radiological pathological correlation. No\\ntice the retraction of the bowel and also notice the resemblance to carcinoid. In these cases the octreoscan can be a great help in the differential diagnosis. These lesions are sit\\nuated in the root of the mesentery and this makes a surgical procedure extremely difficult. These lesions are treated conservatively with immunosuppressiva, anti inflammatory drugs \\nand sometimes anti-estrogens as long as possible.\\nMalignant mesothelioma:\\nMalignant mesothelioma is one of the primary peritoneal malignancies (Table on the left). Malignant mesothelioma Suggestive features are a sheet-like peritoneal thickening and absen\\nce of lymphadenopathy. Just like pleural mesothelioma, it is associated with asbestos exposure. On the left a patient with malignant mesothelioma. Notice the sheet-like thickening o\\nf the peritoneum. The diagnosis was suggested because of the pleural calcifications. Malignant mesothelioma Malignant mesothelioma (2) In advanced cases you will see encasement of t\\nhe intra-peritoneal structures. In the case on the left there is besides encasement of the bowel and the liver, also encasement of the mesentery. On the left a rad-path correlation \\nof the same case. Primary peritoneal serous carcinoma\\nPrimary Peritoneal Serous Carcinoma:\\nThis tumor is also one of the primary peritoneal malignancies.\\nIt occurs exclusively in women.

Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor\\nDesmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor:\\nThis tumor is also one of the primary peritoneal malignancies. It is a rare malignancy of uncertain origin. It occurs primarily in young men with a mean age of 19 years. Consider th\\nis diagnosis if you see something that looks like peritoneal carcinomatosis in a young man that has no history of a primary malignancy. It is a very aggressive tumor with a poor pro\\ngnosis. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor begins as a dominant mass and then multiple masses occur within the peritoneum (figure). At this stage it is no different upon imaging to\\n other tumors, however, the age of the patient provides the clue to the diagnosis.

Lonergan\\nChief of Radiology of the Children's Hospital of Austin, Washington, DC:\\nPublicationdate 2007-5-1 0 This article is based on a presentation given by Gael Lonergan at the 'Teaching in Holland' course and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithu\\nis. In this overview we will discuss the following subjects: by Gael J. Lonergan\\nTesticular torsion:\\nTesticular torsion with twisted spermatic cord (arrow). Torsion occurs when an abnormally mobile testis twists on the spermatic cord, obstructing its blood supply. Patients present \\nwith acute onset of severe testicular pain. The ischemia can lead to testicular necrosis if not corrected within 5-6 hours of the onset of pain. Torsion can be intermittent and can \\nundergo spontaneous detorsion. In a child with an acute scrotum, testicular torsion is not the most common condition (Table). Torsion of testicular appendices represents the more co\\nmmon cause of scrotal pain. Typically, it has a more gradual onset than testicular torsion and patients may endure pain for several days before seeking medical attention. Testicular\\n appendage torsion Testicular appendage torsion appears as a lesion of low echogenicity with a central hypoechogenic area adjacent to the epididymis. Most of the time however, we do\\nn't see it and we do the US just to exclude a testicular torsion. We should see torsion of testicular appendices more as a diagnosis of exclusion. So although torsion of the testicu\\nlar appendix and epididymitis are more common, our goal is mainly to detect or exclude a testicular torsion. We want to be able to tell the surgeon whether or not it is a surgical e\\nmergency. Testicular torsion: Optimal setting for color on normal side, followed by examination of symptomatic side.\\nColor doppler:\\nComplete absence of intratesticular blood flow and normal extratesticular blood flow on color Doppler images is diagnostic, if the flow is normal in the contralateral testis.\\nYet, the presence of flow within the testis does not exclude the presence of torsion, because incomplete vascular obstruction can sometimes occur or intermittent torsion. The case o\\nn the left shows a testicular torsion of the left testis. This case is very obvious because there is no flow on the affected side, but also a difference in echogenicity. With prolon\\nged torsion, the testis is typically hypoechoic and inhomogeneous and is often accompanied by a surrounding hydrocele.\\nBy the time these sonographic findings occur, surgical salvage of the testicle is unlikely. Use at least a 10 MHz linear transducer. Always start with the examination of the normal \\nside and optimize the settings for low flow, low resistance and low velocity. The background 'noise' should just be visible in the asymptomatic testis. Once you have a good image of\\n the normal side, don't touch any of the settings' and go to the symptomatic side. Small testis in a very young child, difficult to differentiate from the surrounding fat In the ver\\ny young child it can be difficult to examine the testes because they are very small and mobile. The prepubertal testis has a volume of about 1-2 cc, while the postpubertal testis ha\\ns about 30cc. With age the testis increases in echogenicity, so in a very young child the small testis can be difficult to differentiate from the surrounding fat, especially if it i\\ns retracted into the inguinal canal (figure). At the start of the examination you can put your finger on the inguinal canal, so that the testis can not move around.\\nColor Doppler imaging has limited sensitivity for detecting blood flow in pediatric patients with a testicular volume of less than 1cc. Two cases of torsio testis. On the left two m\\nore cases. On the far left a child of 10 months old with torsio testis. There is more flow in the tissues around the testis than in the testis itself and that is abnormal, unless th\\ne child has cellulitis. The case next to it is an older child. The gray scale ultrasound shows an abnormal testis. So this could be torsio or orchitis, but the absent flow tells us,\\n that this definitely is a torsio testis.\\nPresentation:\\nThe testis is usually elevated as a result of the torsion and the shortening of the cord itself and may be in a transverse lie. The affected side can be larger from the swollen test\\nis itself, a hydrocele or skin thickening.\\nGray scale Ultrasound:\\nGray scale ultrasound is helpfull, not in making the diagnosis, but in predicting the outcome. For the first 4-6 hours there is a normal architecture. During this period the testis \\nis salvagable, so a normal appearance on gray scale means good outcome. After this period the testis becomes heterogeneous and enlarged over the next 4-24 hours and the epididymis a\\nnd scrotal wall may swell and become hypoechoic. A worsening appearance of the testis on gray scale US correlates with decreased viability (1). A difference in echogenicity means po\\nor outcome. The way to look at differences in echogenicity, is to get a transverse image of both testes. The images on the left show the affected side to be bigger and more echogeni\\nc. This testis is probably not salvagable. The testis may appear more echogenic or less echogenic, it doesn't matter, as long as there is a difference, there is a poor outcome.\\nEpididymitis:\\nEpididymitis is the most common inflammatory process involving the scrotum and more common in adults. Infections generally originate in the lower urinary tract from the bladder, ure\\nthra or prostate and are typically caused by urinary tract pathogens or sexually transmitted organisms (Chlamydia or gonorrrhhea) . Epididymitis also occurs in children, but is then\\n due to infection with Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. In urinary tract abnormalities also infection with E.Coli is seen. A sterile chemical epididymitis can result from reflux of \\nsterile urine through the ejaculatory ducts, for instance if the ureter inserts in the prostatic urethra, this may lead to increased pressure in the vas deferens. . On the left a ch\\nild with a meningocele who had epididymitis. Due to increased bladder pressure and contractions against a closed sphincter, there was reflux not only into the left ureter and porsta\\nte, but also into the epididymis, which resulted in epididymitis. The case on the left shows the typical features of epididymitis. The epididymis is swollen and heterogeneous. There\\n is a hydrocele and scrotal wall thickening. With color doppler there is increased flow. A normal epididymis has only limited colorflow.\\nOrchitis:\\nOrchitis is characterized by focal, peripheral, hypoechoic testicular lesions that are poorly defined, amorphous, or crescent-shaped. Orchitis also exhibits testicular hyperemia on \\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 395}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"color Doppler sonography images and is usually accompanied by epididymal hyperemia due to concomitant epididymitis. A reactive hydrocele is also frequently associated with epididymo\\norchitis. Focal testicular infarction can occur as a complication of epididymitis when swelling of the epididymis is severe enough to constrict the testicular blood supply. This app\\nears as a hypoechoic intratesticular mass devoid of blood flow. The complications of orchitis are abscess formation and ischemia. The case on the left is a young patient, who came a\\n week before with a hyperemic testis and epididymitis. Due to ongoing infection, the pressure within the testis increased leading to infarction. This is not due to torsion, but can \\nbe easily mistaken for torsion. On the left two cases with abnormal areas within the testis probably due to absces formation.\\nTrauma:\\nHematocele:\\nIn trauma there is either a hematocele or testicular hematoma. In the acute phase the hemorrhage is echogenic and in the chronic phase it is hypoechoic. A hematocele results from sc\\nrotal or intra-abdominal hemorrhage. It represents bleeding between the leaves of the tunica vaginalis and appears as a complex fluid collection. With time, this collection can deve\\nlop loculations, which appear as thick septations. It is important to be able to tell if the testis is intact, because if there is a rupture, this can sometimes be treated surgicall\\ny. On the left a patient with a typical hematocele.\\nTesticular rupture:\\nTesticular rupture is seen as focal alterations of testicular echogenicity correlating with areas of intratesticular hemorrhage or infarction in a patient with a hematocele. A discr\\nete fracture plane is identified in fewer than 20% of cases, although visible alterations in the testicular contour are a common finding. On the left a complicated case. The ultraso\\nund demonstrated a large hematocele. There was doubt whether the echogenic structure indeed was a testis. MR was performed and no testicular tissue was found, so we have to conclude\\n that the echogenic structure is a result of fresh hematoma. On the left another patient with a rupture, that was seen on the abdominal CT. On US there was a large heterogeneous are\\na with no identifiable testis due to rupture.\\nHernia:\\nLEFT: herniated bowel in preterm.RIGHT: left-sided hernia in constipated child due to intermitted herniation of sigmoid. Hernias in children are common especially in premature infan\\nts. Sometimes we can see them on plain films as we see in the case on the left. If they are filled with bowel, they are easy to detect, but sometimes these hernias are only filled w\\nith soft tissue Longitudinal view of inguinal canal. The herniated bowel is seen next to the testis (arrow). The ultrasound examination starts with the child lying down and is then \\ncontinued in the standing position. The bowel or omentum is visible separate from the testis (figure). The intestinal loop descends through the unclosed processus vaginalis. An inca\\nrcerated hernia is a cause of acute scrotal pain. Peristalsis suggests viability and absence of peristalsis is worrisome for incarceration.\\nIdiopathic Scrotal Edema:\\nIdiopathic scrotal edema is seen in school-aged boys. They present with scrotal skin swelling. So the clinical question is, if there is torsion or infection. At examination the test\\nes and epididymes are normal and all that we see on US is skin edema. If this is all we see and the child does not have fever or elevated white count, which can be seen in celluliti\\ns, than we can make the diagnosis of Idiopathic scrotal edema. Although this is an idiopathic disease, so we don't know what it is, it is nevertheless important to make this diagnos\\nis. It is far more reasuring for parents to be told, that their child has a specific diagnosis, that it is benign and will go away with time. That is better, than telling them, that\\n you don't know what it is, but it is no torsion, so you don't really worry about it. J US Med 1997; 16: 23.\\n2.

              " Document(page_content='Traumatic hemorrhage:\\nEpidural hematoma:\\nAn epidural hematoma is a bleeding that occurs between the dura and the skull.\\nIt is mostly seen in children who have a head injury with fracture of the temporal bone resulting in tearing of the middle meningeal artery. In theory an epidural hematoma can cross\\n the midline because it is located between the dura and the skull.\\nHowever since the dura is tightly adherent to the adjacent skull near suture lines, an epidural hematoma usually does not cross suture lines.

CT\\n findings A craniotomy was performed subsequently and  the torn middle meningeal artery was coagulated. Clinical outcome was good.\\nSubdural hematoma:\\nA subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the inner layer of the dura and the arachnoid.\\nIt cannot cross the midline, but can be located near dural folds like the falx or the tentorium. It usually results from rupture of the cortical bridging veins.\\nIt usually occurs in head trauma and especially in patients who are treated with antcoagulantia. It is most common in elderly and alcoholics with atrophy. \\nIn brain atrophy the venous subdural structures are less well “packed” against the skull, which give them more space to move and possibility to torn. This patient has an acute subdu\\nral hematoma.\\nThere is midline shift (left image). The patient was operated and the hematoma was evacuated (right image). The images show a subdural hematoma. Notice that the hematoma has both hy\\nperdense and isodense  areas. This can be seen in hyperacute bleeding, but can also be seen in rebleeding. There is displacement of midline structures with obstruction of CSF flow r\\nesulting in dilatation of the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle (arrow). An acute subdural hematoma is hyperdens (clotted blood), a subacute hematoma is isodens and a chr\\nonic subdural hematoma appears hypodens to brain parenchyma (isodens to CSF). Sign of active bleedingIn the acute setting, a subdural hematoma can appear heterogenous, because of th\\ne mixed components of the hemorrhage: fresh in flow of non clotted blood (hypodens) and clotted blood (hyperdens). Subacute isodense subdural hematoma(3-21 days). Isodense subdural \\nhematoma As a subdural hematoma ages, the density of the hematoma will decrease and may be the same as the density of the brain, which make it difficult to detect the hematoma. Here\\n a case of an isodense subdural hematoma which is very hard to detect (arrows). Notice that on a higher level there is a bilateral subdural hematoma. In rare cases an acute subdural\\n hematoma may be isodense to the brain. This is seen in patients with severe anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or if the hematoma is diluted with cerebrospinal fluid (\\nref). When a chronic subdural hematoma (> 21 days) becomes hypodens to parenchyma and isodens to CSF, it may mimick a hygroma. A hygroma is the result of a traumatic torn in the ara\\nchnoid layer which causes CSF to leak to the subdural space,. A subdural hematoma can spread along the falx and tentorium as seen in this case.\\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage:\\nThe images show hyperdense blood in the subarachnoid space of the Sylvian fissure (yellow arrow). Notice the subgaleal hemorrhage in the right occipital region (blue arrow). This is\\n a coupe contrecoupe type of injury. This is another coupe contrecoupe type of injury with contusional hemorrhages and a subdural hematoma in the left frontal lobe near the skull ba\\nse (red arrow).

FAP is an inherited condition in which numerous adenomatous po\\nlyps form.\\n* MEN-1 syndrome Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 or Wermer's syndrome is a syndrome in which endocrine tumors can develop including carcinoid.\\nAdenocarcinoma:\\nAdenocarcinoma represents 25-40% of all small bowel neoplasms. However coloncarcinoma is 50 times more common. 50% of small bowel adenocarcinomas occur in the duodenum and most of t\\nhese are found with endoscopy. The jejunum is the second most prevalent site. Risk factors: Study the coronal reconstructed CT-image. Then continue reading. The findings are: The ty\\npical imaging representation of a small bowel adenocarcinoma is a focal unilocular, circumferential mass with shouldering of the margins and obstruction. Less frequently adenocarcin\\nomas present as an intraluminal polypoid mass, which can lead to intussusception. Ulceration is a quite common feature. Extraluminal infiltration can present as fatstranding. Here a\\nnother example of a duodenal carcinoma presenting as irregular wall thickening in the distal duodenum (arrows). Adenocarcinomas often show moderate enhancement, while carcinoid tumo\\nrs show bright enhancement. Metastases to the liver and peritoneum occur frequently. The images show a circumferential mass with shouldering of the margins. Adenocarcinoma in the je\\njunum Large adenocarcinomas can mimic a lymphoma as in this case. The images show an irregular mass in the proximal jejunum. Although it is a large circumferential growing mass, the\\n lumen is not obstructed. There is a large conglomerate of hypodense lymph nodes in the adjacent mesentery, consistent with necrotic lumph node metastases (lower image). This proved\\n to be an adenocarcinoma, but these findings could very well represent a lymphoma. Here the endoscopic image of the tumor. Here a patient with extensive wall thickening of the proxi\\nmal jejunum with aneurysmatic dilatation. On top of our differential diagnostic list would be a lymphoma, but this proved to be an adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma in the jejunum Feat\\nures that favour adenocarcinoma are fat stranding due to mesenteric fat infiltration and lymph node metastases. In lymphoma fat stranding is uncommon, but lymph node metastases do o\\nccur and are usually more bulky. The images show a short obstructing circular mass in the jejunum (yellow arrow) with enlarged lymph node (red arrow). This proved to be an adenocarc\\ninoma. Adenocarcinoma in the jejunum Post-contrast T1W-image with fatsat (left) and T2W-image (right) show an obstructing mass in the jejunum with shouldering (arrow). There is pres\\ntenotic dilatation. Top images show a circular mass in the proximal jejunum with FDG uptake (yellow arrows). Lower MR-images show the same jejunal mass with shouldered borders and m\\nesenteric lymphadenopathy (red arrows), consistent with adenocarcinoma. First study the images. Then continue reading. The red arrow indicates the sigmoid, which is filled with fece\\ns. So this is not a small bowel feces sign. The findings are: One could consider the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. However this patient was not known with Crohn's disease and the te\\nrminal ileum (not shown) was normal, which would be uncommon. At surgery this proved to be an adenocarcinoma. Here an adenocarcinoma in the proximal jejunum. The mass is better depi\\ncted with MRI than with CT. Adenocarcinoma in Crohn's disease As mentioned before 50% of small bowel adenocarcinomas occur in the duodenum. These tumors are mostly found with endosc\\nopy. The jejunum is the second most prevalent site. Occurrence in the ileum is often related to Crohn's disease as in this case. There is a thickened wall of the ileum with adjacent\\n mesenteric infiltration with foci of extraluminal air indicating perforation. This proved to be an ulcerating adenocarcinoma in a patient with M. Crohn. The diagnosis is seldom mad\\ne pre-operatively due to lack of typical imaging features. The risk is related to the duration and anatomical extent of the disease and develops in the terminal ileum, in the region\\n of active Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease with stenosis but no carcinoma. Here a patient with active Crohn's disease, who has a stenotic segment in the terminal ileum. This patien\\nt does not have an adenocarcinoma. The findings are: Here another adenocarcinoma located in the jejunum. There are multiple lymph nodes (red arrow) and there is fat stranding (yello\\nw arrows). It should not be mistaken for mesenteric panniculitis as these large necrotic lymph nodes are pathologic.\\nLymphoma:\\nLymphoma in the terminal ileum Lymphomas make up about 20 % of all small bowel tumors. The distal ileum is the most common site, owing to the large amount of lymphoid tissue that is\\n present in the distal ileum. Risk factors include celiac disease, Crohn's disease, SLE, immunocompromised state and a history of chemotherapy or extra-intestinal lymphoma. The typi\\ncal presentation of a small bowel lymphoma is a thick walled infiltrating mass with aneurysmal dilatation without obstruction. Aneurysmal dilatation is based upon destruction of the\\n bowel wall and the myenteric nerve plexus. Here a typical presentation (figure). There is irregular wall thickening of the terminal ileum with aneurysmatic dilatation. Lymphoma in \\nthe proximal jejunum A less common presentation is as an intraluminal polypoid mass or a large excentric mass with extension into the surrounding soft tissues with possible ulcerati\\non and formation of fistulas. As mentioned before, large adenocarcinomas and lymphomas can have similar imaging appearances. Bulky mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and \\nsplenomegaly are findings that support the diagnosis of a lymphoma. Infiltration of the mesenteric fat favours the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma. Here a typical lymphoma presenting\\n as a large thick walled mass in the proximal jejunum with FDG uptake. Dilated lumen at the site of the mass and prestenotic dilatation of the duodenum (red arrow) First study the i\\nmages and take special notice of the first image. Then continue reading. The findings are: EATL Here another patient with celiac disease. There is an irregular mass in the jejunum w\\nith luminal dilatation. There is infiltration of the mesentery. Pathology showed a T-cell lymphoma in celiac disease. This is called enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma or EATL. \\nThis is a type of T-cell lymphoma that affects the small intestine in patients with celiac disease. EATL lymphoma in a patient with celiac disease. Here another example of a T-cell \\nlymphoma in celiac disease.\\nCarcinoid tumor:\\nSmall intraluminal mass in the ileum (yellow arrow). Associated spiculated mesenteric mass with adjacent desmoplastic reaction in small bowel carcinoid. Carcinoid tumors are rare ne\\nuroendocrine tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors of the small can be divided in well-differentiated - also known as carcinoid and poorly differentiated - small or large cell neuroendocrin\\ne carcinoma. Here we will discuss the carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors constitute 2% of all gastrointestinal tumors. The incidence of carcinoid tumors increased over the last deca\\ndes, exceeding that of adenocarcinoma, making it the most common small bowel malignancy. The most common location of a carcinoid is the appendix, usually as an incidental finding fo\\nllowing appendectomy. It is uncommon to diagnose a carcinoid of the appendix on imaging studies. These images are of a patient who presented with peritoneal metastases. The primary \\ntumor proved to be a carcinoid of the appendix. The second most common location is the distal ileum. The stomach, colon and rectum are rare locations. Small bowel carcinoids are mul\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 398}),\n",

Here a typical carcinoid presenting as a large mesenteric mass with desm\\noplastic reaction and retraction of adjacent small bowel loops with wall thickening (arrows). Carcinoid with calcification and desmoplastic reaction. Obstructive small bowel ileus b\\nased on intraluminal component of carcinoid. Note small liver metastasis (arrow). Carcinoid metastases The likelihood of metastases is related to the size of the tumor. For example,\\n the incidence of nodal and liver metastases is approximately 20-30% in patients with carcinoid tumors smaller than 1 cm but increases to almost 60-80% for nodal metastases and 20% \\nfor liver metastases when tumors are 1-2 cm. In patients with primary tumors greater than 2 cm, the incidence of nodal metastases is 80% and of liver metastases is 40-50%. Liver met\\nastases are usually hypervascular and can show central necrosis. Most of the lymph node metastases show calcifications, similar to the primary tumor. Multiple livermetastases of a c\\narcinoid tumor. Same patient. Four years after the initial CT multiple liver metastases are seen. Notice hypervascular enhancement pattern in the late arterial phase. Carcinoid synd\\nrome The carcinoid syndrome occurs in approximately 5% of carcinoid tumors and becomes manifest when vasoactive substances from the tumors enter the systemic circulation. It commonl\\ny occurs in patients who have liver metastases. Symptoms include flushing and diarrhea and less frequently bronchospasm and heart failure. The heart failure is the result of seroton\\nin-induced fibrosis of the cardiac valves, notably the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. The images show a carcinoid tumor presenting as a hypervascular mass (red arrow) with desmopla\\nstic reaction (yellow arrow). Carcinoid presenting as hyperenhancing lesion in the late arterial phase Carcinoid tumors are slowly growing tumors that may go unrecognized for many y\\nears. They start as small submucosal lesions (images). As the carcinoid grows, thickening of the bowel wall occurs, leading eventually to extension outside the bowel wall. Carcinoid\\n tumors can cause an intense desmoplastic reaction with retraction of bowel loops and fibrosis, sometimes leading to bowel ischemia. However, when the carcinoid is small the finding\\ns are non-specific. It can present as a small submucosal nodule with arterial enhancement (image) and sometimes they lead to intussusception.\\nGIST:\\nTypical GIST in the ileum presenting as an exophytic tumor. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are mesenchymal tumors and represent 9% of all small bowel tumors. These tumors most freq\\nuently occur in the stomach, followed by jejunum and ileum. Occurrence in colon, rectum, esophagus and appendix is rare. About 20-30 % of GIST's are malignant at presentation. In th\\ne small bowel they are more often malignant than in the stomach. Tumors smaller than 2 cm are usually benign, whereas masses larger than 5 cm are often malignant. Malignant GIST's p\\nredominantly grow extraluminally and can show necrosis, hemorrhage, calcification (post therapy) and fistula formation. Typically a GIST is a well defined and exophytic mass with he\\nterogeneous enhancement and a clear delineation from the mesentery. An intraluminal mass is far less common. Obstruction is rare because GISTs do not involve the circumferential bow\\nel wall, in contrast to adenocarcinoma. Unlike carcinoid tumors, the primary lesion in a GIST is large. Both GIST and lymphoma can show aneurysmal dilation of the bowel. Liver metas\\ntases are usually hypervascular and can be missed on a single portal venous phase CT. Lymph node metastases are generally not seen. If lymphadenopathy is seen, you should consider a\\nnother diagnosis. Mesenteric or omental metastases are more common in recurrent disease than at first presentation. This is thought to be due to spill of tumor during surgery. These\\n metastases can be easily missed, as they often have a low-density center. After chemotherapy (Imatinib or Gleevec), the liver and mesenteric metastases become hypovascular or even \\ncystic. Despite radical surgical resection, 40-90 % of patients have recurrence of disease in liver or mesentery. Gleevec can be given in case of metastatic disease. Disease recurre\\nnce in resected GIST showing hypodense livermetastases and a large heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis.\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\nThe differential diagnosis of small bowel tumors includes many infectious and inflammatory diseases, that all present with focal bowel wall thickening. The most common small bowel t\\numors are metastases, which are more common than primary malignancies. Multiple intraluminal metastases in a patient with a history of melanoma.\\nMetastases:\\nThe spread of metastases to the small bowel can be intraperitoneal, hematogenous, lymphatic or by direct extension. Most common (50%) is intraperitoneal seeding. This is mostly seen\\n in primary tumors originating from ovary, appendix and colon. Metastatic cells implant on the mesenteric border of the bowel. Hematogenous metastases usually occur in breast carcin\\noma, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. They can be polypoid and can cause intussusception. Here a patient with metastatic melanoma. Left image shows ileal-ileal intussusception due\\n to metastasis. Right image shows intussusception in coronal plane as well as an enlarged mesenteric lymph node (yellow arrow) and extensive liver metastases. Another patient with a\\n small bowel metastasis. This patient had a history of colon- and esophaguscarcinoma. This patient has multiple intraluminal small bowel masses (yellow arrows), which appeared to be\\n metastases from an unknown primary. Also note the intussusception (red arrow) en soft tissue metastasis in the left gluteus muscle (blue arrow). History of ileocecal resection. Foc\\nal ileal wall thickening with some enhancement in Crohn's disease.\\nCrohn's disease:\\nWall thickening in inflammatory or infectious small bowel disease should be differentiated from malignant wall thickening. Distinguishing features of inflammation (Crohn's disease) \\nare ulcerations, increased mesenteric vessels (comb sign), skip lesions and increased surrounding fat (creeping fat). An association between Crohn's disease and small bowel adenocar\\ncinoma is well-established. Differentiating these two is challenging pre-operatively when there are no typical imaging features. An indicator of malignancy is a small bowel obstruct\\nion that is refractory to medical therapy. Crohn's disease with multiple lesions (arrows). Active Crohn's disease. Long segment of ileal wall thickening with comb sign and transmura\\nl enhancement.\\nSclerosing or fibrosing mesenteritis:\\nSclerosing or fibrosing mesenteritis develops in the mesentery and can be mass-like and mimic a malignant tumor like a carcinoid. In these cases sclerosing mesenteritis can be diffe\\nrentiated by the 'fat ring sign',which means there is preservation of fat surrounding the mesenteric vessels.\\nDesmoid:\\nDesmoid is a rare, benign, locally aggressive mass composed of fibrous tissue. It is the most common primary tumor of the mesentery and can mimic a malignant bowel- or mesenteric ne\\noplasm. Most desmoids are sporadic tumors, but some occur in the setting of Gardner syndrome. There is often a history of previous abdominal surgery. Desmoid tumors do not metastasi\\nze, but do tend to recur. The high recurrence rate favors the use of nonsurgical therapy. Mesenteric desmoids usually show minimal enhancement. Small bowel or mesenteric vessels can\\n be displaced or encased. Because these tumors can be very hard, percutaneous biopsy can be challenging.\\nAdenomas:\\nAdenomas are pre-cancerous lesions that can present as polypoid pedunculated masses on a stalk, a sessile mass (no stalk) or a mural based nodule within the mucosa. Lesions show hom\\nogeneous enhancement and are usually nonobstructive. Extraserosal extension is suggestive of malignant degeneration. Here a patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome with multiple small b\\nowel polyps, mainly located in jejunum. Patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome with ileal polyp as leadpoint for intussusception.\\nPolyposis syndromes:\\nIntestinal polyposis syndromes can be divided into the broad categories of familial adenomatous polyposis (like Gardner syndrome), hamartomatous polyposis syndromes (like Peutz-Jegh\\ners syndrome) and other rare polyposis syndromes. Patients with these syndromes often have multiple small bowel polyps. Larger polyps can become malignant and can mimic primary smal\\nl bowel neoplasms. Here a patient with Peutz-Jeghers, who has multiple polyps in the jejunum. The largest polyp in this patient was removed endoscopically.

              " Document(page_content='Hemangioma:\\nMost intestinal hemangiomas are located in the jejunum. They can be sessile or pedunculated and they usually show nodular arterial enhancement and homogeneous enhancement in the del\\nayed phase.\\nLeiomyoma:\\nLeiomyomas are rare mesenchymal benign tumors. The origin may be intraluminal, submucosal or extraluminal. Benign imaging features include sharp margins, homogeneous aspect and homo\\ngeneous enhancement.\\nLipomas:\\nThese are well-circumscribed intraluminal masses with fat attenuation. Liposarcoma of the small bowel is extremely rare. CT shows a lesion with fat attenuation at duodenal-jejunal j\\nunction. Low signal intensity of the mass on MR T2 fatsat (right lower image). Endoscopic view of lipoma (right upper image).\\nMesenteric ischemia:\\nTarget sign due to ischemic small bowel segment. Note mesenteric edema and ascites. Target sign A target sign is a result of submucosal edema surrounded by enhancing mucosa and musc\\nularis. It is a benign sign and is usually due to inflammation, ischemia or radiation enteritis.\\nTyphlitis:\\nTarget sign in a patient with neutropenic sepsis, consistent with enterocolitis. Neutropenic enterocolitis is a life-threatening, necrotizing enterocolitis and occurs most commonly \\nin individuals with hematologic malignancies who are neutropenic and have breakdown of gut mucosal integrity as a result of cytotoxic chemotherapy (8). \"Typhlitis\" (from the Greek w\\nord \"typhlon,\" or cecum) describes neutropenic enterocolitis of the ileocecal region; we prefer the more inclusive term, \"neutropenic enterocolitis,\" since other parts of the smalla\\nnd/or large intestine are often involved (8).\\nTechnique:\\nSmall bowel tumors can be detected on standard abdominal CT in patients with non-specific symptoms However if the CT findings are unclear or if a small bowel tumor is suspected clin\\nically, CT-enterography or MRI-enterography or enteroclysis is performed. Both MRI and CT have good performance for the diagnosis of small bowel tumors. The choice mainly depends on\\n personal preferences. We prefer MRI enteroclysis as tumors are often well depicted in the dilated bowel loops without use of radiation. For MR enterography and enteroclysis fluid (\\nwater or methylcellulose) is the enteric contrast media with low signal on T1-weighted images and high signal on T2-weighted images. Here we see a coronal T2W-image and a coronal T1\\nW-image with fatsat. Notice that the small bowel is well distended. Luminal distension should be ≥ 2 cm. Bowel wall thickness > 3 mm is considered abnormal. Collapsed small bowel lo\\nops can be easily misinterpreted as wall thickening or abnormal enhancement. On the coronal T1W-image the jejunal loops are collapsed. As a result it looks as if there is bowel wall\\n thickening and prominant enhancement. On the T2W-image during the same examination there is normal distention. PET-CT is not first choice, but can be useful if findings on CT or MR\\n are equivocal or to look for metastatic disease. G.

Lesions larger than 3 cm are considered masse\\ns and are treated as malignancies until proven otherwise. The differential diagnosis of a solitary pulmonary nodule is broad and management depends on whether the lesion is benign o\\nr malignant. In this overview we will discuss some of the new features that can help to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules based upon CT and PET-CT findings.\\nCT: benign versus malignant:\\nBenign pattern of calcification\\nCalcification:\\nDiffuse, central, laminated or popcorn calcifications are benign patterns of calcification. These types of calcification are seen in granulomatous disease and hamartomas. All other \\npatterns of calcification should not be regarded as a sign of benignity. The exception to the rule above is when patients are known to have a primary tumor. For instance the diffuse\\n calcification pattern can be seen in patients with osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma. Similarly the central and popcorn pattern can be seen in patients with GI-tumors and patients who\\n previously had chemotherapy. Relationship between SPN-size and chance of malignancy in patients with high risk for lung cancer\\nSize:\\nA solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is defined as a single intraparenchymal lesion less than 3 cm in size and not associated with atelectasis or lymphadenopathy. A lesion greater than\\n 3 cm in diameter is called a mass. This distinction is made, because lesions greater than 3 cm are usually malignant, while smaller lesions can be either benign or malignant. Swens\\nen et al studied the relationship between the size of a SPN and the chance of malignancy in a cohort at high risk for lung cancer (1). Their findings are listed in the table on the \\nleft. They concluded that benign nodule detection rate is high, especially if lesions are small. Of the over 2000 nodules that were less than 4 mm in size, none was malignant.\\nGrowth:\\nComparison with prior imaging studies is often the most useful procedure to determine the importance of the finding of a SPN, since stability over 2 years is highly associated with \\nbenignity.

              " Document(page_content='Japanese screening studies showed that a polygonal shape and a three-dimensional ratio > 1.78 was a sign of benignity (2,3). A polygonal shape means that the lesion has multiple fac\\nets (multi-sided). A peripheral subpleural location was also a sign of benignity in this study. The three-dimensional ratio is measured by obtaining the maximal transverse dimension\\n and dividing it by the maximal vertical dimension. A large three-dimensional ratio indicates that the lesion is relatively flat, which is a benign sign. Corona radiata sign in a ma\\nlignant lesion with spiculation at the margin.\\nMargin:\\nAir bronchogram sign seen in\\nAir Bronchogram sign:\\nRecent studies have showed that an air bronchogram is more commonly seen in malignant pulmonary nodules. It is most commonly seen in BAC (bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma) and adenoca\\nrcinoma. The case on the left shows an airbronchogram seen as a linear lucency (broad arrow) and as a more cystic lucency (small arrow) due to the fact that the bronchus is seen en \\nface. On the left two solitary pulmonary nodules. Based upon the morphology, which lesion has the most malignant features? The lesion on the far left has a spicuated margin and has \\nlucencies within it. The lesion next to it is lobulated in contour and has some spicules radiating to the pleura. It is however homogeneous in attenuation. Based on these findings w\\ne should be most concerned that the lesion on the far left is malignant. It proved to be an adenocarninoma, while the other one was a fungal infection. The lucencies and frank air b\\nronchograms should not mislead you in thinking that it probably is infection. Partly solid nodule containing ground-glass component most likely to be malignant\\nSolid and Ground-glass components:\\nAnother result from screening studies is that nodules containing a ground-glass component are more likely to be malignant (5). LEFT: 1 in 5 malignantRIGHT: 2 in 3 malignant On the f\\nar left a lesion that only has a ground-glass appearance and next to it a lesion that has both ground-glass and solid components. The likelihood of malignancy is 1:5 for the lesion \\non the far left and 2:3 for the lesion with both ground-glass and solid components. Baseline scan and scans after contrast enhancement. Benign lesion with\\nContrast enhancement:\\nContrast enhancement less than 15 HU has a very high predictive value for benignity (99%). After a baseline scan, 4 consecutive scans at 1 minute interval are performed. This applie\\ns only for nodules with the following selection criteria:\\nPET-CT: benign versus malignant:\\nFalse negative PET in a patient with adenocarcinoma. Activity is not sufficient for the diagnosis malignancy. PET-CT plays an increasingly important role in the evaluation of solita\\nry nodules.

In this article we will discuss: Depiction of anat\\nomical variations of osseous outlet in patients with impingement symptoms. Anatomy\\nAnatomy:\\nAnterior view of the shoulder\\nRotator cuff:\\nThe rotator cuff is composed of the tendons of the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor, that attach to the proximal humerus.\\nThe main function of the rotator cuff is to stabilize and center the humeral head in the glenoid cavity during movements of the arm by compressing the humeral head against the gleno\\nid.\\nThe rotator cuff – as the name suggests – also plays a major role in the internal and external rotation of the arm. SubscapularisThe subscapularis is located anterior to the scapula\\n with insertion of the tendon on the lesser tuberosity.\\nThe subscapularis muscle is a powerful internal rotator which also supports the arm during abduction and adduction. Dislocation of the long head of the biceps will result in rupture\\n of part of the subscapularis tendon. SupraspinatusThe supraspinatus muscle is located in the suprascapular fossa with insertion of the tendon on the greater tuberosity. The suprasp\\ninatus muscle initiates the abduction of the arm, which is continued by the deltoid muscle, which is the great abductor and extensor of the arm. Long head of the biceps\\nThe long head of biceps tendon is anatomically and functionally related to the rotator cuff. The tendon arises from the supraglenoid tubercle and its proximal segment is intra-artic\\nular. It exits the gleno-humeral joint and passes through the rotator interval between the subscapularis and supraspinatus tendons into the bicipital groove of the proximal humerus \\nPosterior view of the shoulder InfraspinatusThe infraspinatus muscleis located posterior to the scapula, inferior to the scapular spine. The tendon of the Infraspinatus muscle attac\\nheson the posterior aspect of the greater tuberosity.\\nThe infraspinatus muscle is a strong external rotator and additionally assists in both abduction and adduction.

              " Document(page_content='The tendon attaches on the greater tuberosity.\\nThe teres minor muscle’s function consists primarily of external rotation and adduction of the arm. Other structures that stabilize the glenohumeral joint are the joint capsule, lab\\nrum and glenohumeral ligaments.\\nAcromion types:\\nFour types of acromial arch are described.\\nIn the Bigliami classification type 1-3 were described. later a fourth convex type was added. Type 2 with the curved shape is the most common type. Type 3 with a hooked shape is the\\n only type that is associated with an increased incidence of shoulder impingement.\\nOs Acromiale:\\nFailure of one of the acromial ossification centers to fuse will result in an os acromiale. \\nIt is present in 5% of the population. \\nUsually it is an incidental finding and regarded as a normal variant. An os acromiale may cause symptoms due to arthrosis in the acromio-acromion articulation or due to impingement \\nbecause if the os acromiale is unstable, it may be pulled inferiorly during abduction by the deltoid, which attaches here. On MR an os acromiale is best seen on superior axial image\\ns.\\nAn os acromiale must be mentioned in the report, because in patients who are considered for subacromial decompression, the removal of the acromion distal to the synchondrosis may fu\\nrther destabilize the synchondrosis and allow for even greater mobility of the os acromiale after surgery and worsening of the impingement (4). The axial MR-images show an os acromi\\nale with degenerative changes, i.e. subchondral cysts and osteophytes (arrow).\\nEtiology of rotator cuff tears:\\nThe etiology of rotator cuff tears can be traumatic, like in a direct trauma to the subscapular muscle and tendon or a more chronic tear of the supraspinatous tendon due to repetiti\\nve trauma in overhead sports-activity.\\nThis is usually seen in younger people. In older people the cause of rotator cuff tears is degenerative as seen in subacromial impingement or due to hypovascularity in specific part\\ns of the tendons.\\nPartial thickness tears:\\nPartial thickness tears are rotator cuff tears that do not have a full transmural extension from the articular side to the bursal side. Partial thickness tears can be divided into: \\nArticular-sided partial tears are more common than bursal-sided, because the eccentric forces are more intense on articular side and the fibers on the articular side are weaker and \\nhealing is reduced.

These labral tears make the shoulder unstable and susce\\nptible to repeated dislocations. In this article we will focus on: Bankart tears and variants Introduction\\nIntroduction:\\nClockwise approach. Click on image to enlarge\\nClockwise approach to labral pathology:\\nA Clockwise approach to the labrum is the easiest way to diagnose labral tears and to differentiate them from normal labral variants. There are two types of labral tears: SLAP tears\\n and Bankart lesions. SLAP is an acronym that stands for 'Superior Labral tear from Anterior to Posterior'. SLAP tears start at the 12 o'clock position where the biceps anchor is lo\\ncated, which tears the labrum off the glenoid. SLAP tears typically extend from the 10 to the 2 o'clock position, but can extend more posteriorly or anteriorly and even extend into \\nthe biceps tendon. Bankart lesions are typically located in the 3-6 o'clock position because that's where the humeral head dislocates. There are many labral variants that may simula\\nte a labral tear. They also have a typical location. They are not in the 3-6 o'clock position, which makes it easy to differentiate them from a Bankart tear. A Bankart tear can exte\\nnd to the 1-3 o'clock position, but then there should also be a tear in the 3-6 o'clock position. Labral variants however may mimick a SLAP tear. Labral variants\\nDislocation:\\nThe shoulder is a very mobile and therefore unstable joint. It is the most dislocated joint in the body. The humeral head is almost always displaced anteriorly and medially below th\\ne coracoid process.\\nAnterior dislocation:\\nThe shoulder almost always dislocates to anterior and inferior, because motion to superior is limited by the acromion, coracoid process and rotator cuff (figure). Motion in a poster\\nior direction is limited by the posterior rim of the glenoid which is in an anteverted position. An uncommon cause of anterior dislocation is inpatients with a dysplasia of the glen\\noid. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll The dislocation of the humeral head to antero-inferior causes damage to the antero-inferior rim of the glenoid in the 3 - 6 o'clock position (marked in red). Especial\\nly in younger patients this results in a Bankart fracture or a Bankart lesion which is a tear of the anteroinferior labrum. This results in instability and recurrent dislocations. D\\nue to these recurrent dislocations significant bone loss and erosion of the anterior glenoid rim may occur, which maintains the unstable situation. Scroll through images.

On the coronal-oblique and sagittal reconstruction the dis\\nplaced fragment of the glenoid rim is seen in the 3-6 o'clock position. On the coronal image a large Hill-Sachs defect is seen. This is a bone defect as result of the impaction of t\\nhe glenoid rim on the humeral head. 3D-reconstruction of a large bony Bankart in the 2 - 6 o'clock position. LEFT: Hill-Sachs at level of coracoid. RIGHT: Normal groove seen at leve\\nl below coracoid.\\nHill-Sachs:\\nOn MR a Hill-Sachs defect is seen at or above the level of the coracoid process. Hill-Sachs is a posterolateral depression of the humeral head. It is above or at the level of the co\\nracoid in the first 18 mm of the proximal humeral head. It is seen in 75-100% of patients with anterior instability. The physiologic groove in the humerus or cysts and erosions at t\\nhe attachment site of the infraspinatus tendon can simulate a Hill-Sachs, but usually this is not a diagnostic problem (figure). Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll\\nPosterior dislocation:\\nPosterior dislocations are uncommon and easily missed, because there is less displacement compared to the anterior dislocation. On the AP-view the head looks strange due to the inte\\nrnal rotation. On the transscapular-Y view the humeral head is displaced posteriorly. Sometimes the displacement is difficult to appreciate, especially when the transscapular-Y view\\n is slightly rotated. Sometimes an axillary view can be of help, but when in doubt go to CT.

Notice the distance between the humeral head and the glenoid on the AP-view, which is abnormally \\nwide. Posterior dislocations are uncommon and not as obvious on the X-rays as an anterior dislocation. Approximately half of the posterior shoulder dislocations go undiagnosed on in\\nitial presentation, because of a low level of clinical suspicion and insufficient imaging. Posterior dislocation-fracture Posterior dislocations account for 2-4% of all shoulder dis\\nlocations. Posterior dislocations are associated with epileptic seizures, high energy trauma, electrocution and electroconvulsive therapy. On the images a posterior dislocation is s\\neen with a fracture.

Many of these masses are renal cell carcinomas. The goal of imaging is to differentiate these renal cell carcin\\nomas from benign disease, although in many cases it may not be possible. There are certain imaging findings, however, which are in favor of benign disease or low grade malignancy. T\\nhese imaging findings may offer guidance to patients and referring physicians in making management decisions. Options include partial or radical nephrectomy, biopsy and tumor ablati\\non or follow up with watchful waiting. In this article we will discuss imaging features of benign and malignant renal tumors and tumor mimics.\\nDifferentiation of renal masses:\\nThe steps in the differentiation of a renal lesion are: Once you have followed these steps, there will be many cases in which a final diagnosis can not be made and renal cell carcin\\noma is still on top of your list of differential diagnoses. Use CT and MR to look for findings that are in favor of a benign or low-grade tumor versus a high-grade renal cell carcin\\noma.\\nCT:\\nHyperdensity on unenhanced CTA lesion with a density > 70 HU on an unenhanced CT scan is a hemorrhagic cyst. Hemorrhagic cysts may have densities lower than 70 HU, but in these case\\ns we also need to check the post-contrast series for any enhancement. Lack of enhancement confirms the cystic nature of these lesions. Macroscopic fat < -20 HU in a renal mass is a \\nreliable sign of an angiomyolipoma. Thin slices can be helpful to determine the density. Unfortunately 5% of AMLs do not contain macroscopic fat. These lipid-poor AMLs can not be di\\nstinguished from renal cell carcinoma. In rare cases, RCCs can also contain fat. The presence of calcifications and fat should raise the suspicion of a RCC. Equivocal enhancement of\\n 10-20 HU can be due to pseudo-enhancement in a cyst as a result of beam hardening. MRI can be helpful in differentiating these cases, since it better depicts enhancement. Equivocal\\n enhancement can also be seen in low-enhancing lesions like papillary renal cell carcinoma, which usually is a less aggressive subtype than the more common clear cell carcinoma. Hom\\nogeneous enhancement and a high attenuation value on unenhanced CT (> 40 HU) is in favor of the diagnosis of a lipid-poor AML, although RCC can not be reliably excluded. Strong enha\\nncement is seen in clear cell carcinoma, lipid-poor AML and oncocytoma. Since clear cell carcinoma is far more common than an oncocytoma or a lipid-poor AML, clear cell carcinoma is\\n the most likely diagnosis, especially in a large and heterogeneous mass. Mention the possibility of a lipid-poor AML or oncocytoma in your report, as surveillance or biopsy may be \\nan option in poor surgical candidates.\\nMRI:\\nHigh signal on T1-weighted images is typically seen in hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cysts and in angiomyolipomas that contain macroscopic extracellular fat. Intracellular fat howeve\\nr does not result in a high signal on T1-weighted images but it results in a signal drop on out of phase images.\\nThis can be seen in minimal fat AML or RCC. 82% of clear cell RCC have intracellular fat, which has a 90% specificity for the diagnosis of a clear cell renal cell carcinoma. MRI is \\nbetter than CT in the accurate diagnosis of a cystic lesion and it can better depict enhancement and differentiate CT-pseudo-enhancement from real enhancement. Low T2-signal is in f\\navor of papillary RCC or minimal fat angiomyolipoma. High T2 is typically seen in clear cell RCC but is not specific, since it can also be seen in oncocytomas. So again there is muc\\nh overlap between benign and malignant tumors.\\nBall or Bean:\\nAnother way to look at renal solid masses is to look at the shape. Solid lesions can be divided into ball-type and bean-type lesions. Ball-type lesions are the most common and prese\\nnt as expansile masses, deforming the renal contour. Renal cell carcinomas and oncocytomas are typical ball-type lesions. Bean-type lesions do not deform the renal contour and the b\\nean-shape of the kidney is preserved. Bean-type lesions are more difficult to detect and usually not visible on unenhanced CT images. Notice that there is much overlap in the differ\\nential diagnosis of ball-type and bean-type lesions.\\nBean-type lesions:\\nThe radiologic features of bean-type lesions are generally nonspecific. Notice the similar appearance of the lesions in the figure. The differential diagnosis can often be suggested\\n by integrating clinical and imaging data.\\nSize of a tumor:\\nThe size of a tumor is regarded as the most important predictor of malignancy and aggressive histologic grade (1). The risk of metastatic disease depends on the size of the tumor. I\\nf the size of a tumor is less than 3 cm the risk of metastatic disease is negligible. Most incidentally found renal masses are small, defined as < 4 cm. Many of these masses will be\\n either low grade RCC, indolent malignancies or benign lesions. In renal masses of 1-2 cm which were surgically removed, 56% had a benign histology. Only 13% of masses 6-7 cm had a \\nbenign histology. The growth rate of a small renal mass on serial imaging however has not been shown to provide reliable prediction of malignancy or benignity.\\nRenal cell carcinoma:\\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a typical ball-type lesion. 50% of RCCs are incidental findings on imaging studies performed for non-urinary tract symptoms. Peak incidence of RCC is b\\netween 60 and 70 years. RCC is associated with hereditary syndromes, such as von Hippel-Lindau, tuberous sclerosis and Birt-Hogg-Dubé. The most common subtype of RCC is clear cell c\\narcinoma, followed by papillary and chromophobe RCC. Multilocular cystic RCC is uncommon and discussed here. Renal medullary carcinoma is also very uncommon and occurs almost exclus\\nively in patients with sickle cell trait.\\nClearcell RCC:\\nThis is the most common subtype of RCC, accounting for 70% of all RCCs. These tumors arise from the renal cortex and are often expansive. It is a hypervascular lesion, frequently he\\nterogeneous due to necrosis, hemorrhage, cystic components or calcifications. In rare cases, RCCs can also contain extracellular fat. In a mass with both calcifications and fat, con\\nsider the possibility of a RCC. Clear cell carcinoma best seen in nefrogenic phase A typical feature of clear cell carcinoma is strong enhancement in the corticomedullary phase. Thi\\ns can be difficult to assess when the lesion is small and located in the renal cortex, which also enhances strongly. The nephrogenic phase is therefore the most sensitive phase for \\nthe detection of these lesions, as the renal parenchyma enhances homogeneously and more intensely than the tumor (figure). On MR clear cell RCC is usually iso- to hypointense on T1 \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 406}),\n",

However 80% of clear cell RCC \\nhave intracellular fat, which leads to a drop in signal intensity on T1 opposed-phase images compared to in-phase images. Do not confuse this finding for extracellular fat and do no\\nt make the mistake to conclude that you are dealing with an angiomyolipoma. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is associated with development of clear cell RCCs, often bilateral or multifoca\\nl.

While this is only a small portion of the RCCs, the overall prevalence of RCC makes it an important consideration for the differential diagnosis of an inf\\niltrative bean-type lesion. Infiltrative RCCs are aggressive and hypervascular. It alters the internal architecture of the kidney, preserving the renal contour. Collecting system ab\\nnormalities can be similar to those seen in transitional cell carcinomas.\\nPapillary RCC:\\nPapillary RCC accounts for 10-15% of all RCCs. These lesions are typically homogeneous and hypovascular and can therefore mimic cysts. In contrast to clear cell carcinoma, the enhan\\ncement of papillary renal cell carcinoma can be very subtle, up to only 10-20 HU difference between unenhanced and enhanced images. Larger papillary RCC can be more heterogeneous du\\ne to necrosis, hemorrhage or calcifications. On MR they are frequently iso- to hypointense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted imaged. In very rare cases macroscopic fat is encount\\nered in the lesion, often with calcifications. Bilateral and multifocal tumors are more frequently seen in papillary RCC than in other types of RCC. The 5-year survival is 80-90%. C\\nhromophobe RCC\\nChromophobe RCC:\\n5% of the RCCs are of the chromophobe type. It is a solid, sharply demarcated and sometimes slightly lobulated lesion. They can have a central scar or spoke-wheel pattern of contras\\nt enhancement, similar to oncocytomas. It is not possible to differentiate chromophobe RCC from an oncocytoma on imaging. Even the histology of these tumors share similar characteri\\nstics. The enhancement of a chromophobe RCC is often homogeneous and less intense than in clear cell RCC. The prognosis of a chromophobe RCC is similar to the prognosis of papillary\\n RCC with a 5-year survival of 80-90%. Chromophobe RCC and luncysts in a patient with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome Chromophobe RCC can be seen in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. B\\nirt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare disorder. These patients have small papular skin lesions called fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts with spontaneous pneumothorax and a high incidence of \\ndifferent kinds of renal cell carcinoma: most frequently chromphobe RCC, less commonly oncocytoma, and rarely clear cell carcinoma.\\nStaging RCC:\\nRCC can invade the perinephric fat beyond the renal fascia and can extend into the renal vein, inferior vena cava or the adjacent adrenal gland. For the surgeon it is important to k\\nnow whether there is tumor thrombus in the IVC and if it extends into the chest above the diaphragm (need for a thoracic surgeon during the operation). Approximately 25% of the pati\\nents have metastases at presentation.

A thoracic surgeon will be needed during surgery. Metastases of RCC in the pancreas. Metastases 25% of the patients with renal cell carcinoma have metastase\\ns at presentation. Common sites are the lung, liver, lymph nodes and bones. Less common sites are pancreas, adrenal gland, contralateral kidney, mesentery, abdominal wall and brain.\\n The image shows a patient with metastases in the pancreas.\\nAngiomyolipoma:\\nAngiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign solid renal mass. It is composed of angiomatous tissue, smooth muscle and fat. If a lesion contains macroscopic fat on CT, the diagnos\\nis of AML can be made. On CT an AML is usually a well-defined, heterogeneous tumor, located in the renal cortex and containing areas of fat density of -20 HU or less. Calcification \\nor necrosis within the tumor is rare. The presence of both fat and calcifications should raise the suspicion of a RCC. Enhancement is seen in the vascular and smooth muscle portions\\n of the lesion. Multiple Angiomyolipomas in a patient with tuberous sclerosis. Multiple Angiomyolipomas Sporadic AML is typically small, unilateral and asymptomatic, usually seen as\\n an incidental finding. In 10-20% of cases angiomyolipomas are multiple and bilateral. This is mainly seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Bleeding in Angiomyopiloma Due to the\\n abnormal vessels within an AML, it is prone to bleeding. Patients can present with acute flank pain due to spontaneous hemorrhage. The risk of hemorrhage increases with size. Embol\\nization was performed to stop the bleeding. Preventive embolization is recommended in tumors larger than 4 cm, even in asymptomatic patients. Notice the large vessels in the AML in \\nthe left kidney.\\nMinimal fat Angiomyolipoma:\\nIn 5% of AMLs there is no detectable fat on CT. The fat can be obscured by internal hemorrhage or it can be a so called minimal fat AML. On MR macroscopic fat in an AML gives low si\\ngnal on fat-suppressed images. Microscopic or intracellular fat, seen as a drop in signal intensity on T1 opposed-phase images compared to in-phase images, is not specific for AML, \\nbut can also be present in renal cell carcinoma. Since the fat is likely to be intracellular in RCC, it is unlikely to be visible on CT images.\\nOncocytoma:\\nOncocytoma in left kidney with central scar Oncocytoma is the second most common benign solid renal mass. 3-7% of all solid renal tumors are oncocytomas. They appear as sharply dema\\nrcated lesions with uniform enhancement at CT and often have a central scar. The central scar can not be distinguished from a central scar or central necrosis in a RCC, therefore on\\ncocytoma is the most commonly excised benign solid mass. Oncocytoma in right kidney with central scar Calcifications in an oncocytoma are rare. The tumor is usually solitary, 2-12 c\\nm in diameter, but can be multifocal and bilateral. In less than 10% of cases oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC occur simultaneously.\\nTransitional cell carcinoma:\\nTCC in left kidney preserving the bean shape of the kidney Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) also known as urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) arises from the epithelial cells lining th\\ne urinary tract. Most frequently the TCC arises in the renal pelvis, as a low-grade, superficial tumor, producing a focal intraluminal mass in the renal collecting system. Approxima\\ntely 15% of the TCCs are of a more aggressive type with infiltrative growth, altering the regional architecture of the adjacent renal sinus and renal parenchyma, without changing th\\ne renal contour. TCC is a typical bean-type lesion (see figure). Upper-tract TCC has a peak incidence in the 60- to 70-year age group and is twice as common in men as in women. Risk\\n factors are smoking, chemical carcinogens, cyclophosphamide therapy and analgesic abuse, particularly long-term use of phenacetin. TCC in right kidney preserving the bean shape of \\nthe kidney TCC is hard to detect on unenhanced CT images. The nephrogenic phase is the optimal phase to show the interface between TCC and normal enhancing renal parenchyma. Excreto\\nry phase images show collecting system abnormalities such as dilated calyces, calyces distended by tumor or unopacified calyces due to tumor infiltration. TCC can be locally aggress\\nive with invasion of the retroperitoneum. Regional lymphadenopathy and distant metastases to the lungs and bones may be encountered. TCC is commonly multifocal with a high incidence\\n of recurrence, therefore requiring thorough surveillance. TCC has a greater risk of seeding after percutaneous biopsy than RCC, therefore it is not recommended to perform biopsy wh\\nen there is suspicion of TCC.\\nLymphoma:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 407}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='B-cell lymphoma with renal and bone involvement (arrows) The kidney is a common extranodal site of lymphoma involvement, especially in Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Primary involvement of t\\nhe kidney is rare. Renal lymphoma usually presents as multiple poorly enhancing masses, but may also present as retroperitoneal tumors directly invading the kidneys or as perirenal \\nsoft-tissue masses. Diffuse infiltration of the renal interstitium results in nephromegaly and is more common in Burkitt lymphoma. The image shows bilateral involvement of the kidne\\ny and a bone lesion in a patient with B-cell lymphoma. Here another patient with lymphoma located in the mediastinum, pancreas (arrow) and in both kidneys. Diffuse enlargement of bo\\nth kidneys in a patient with lymphoma. Continue with the PET-CT. PET-CT shows diffuse renal involvement and also positive periaortic lymph nodes (arrows).\\nMetastases:\\nInfiltrative lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney, which has considerably grown six months later, with extensive lymphadenopathy. This turned out to be a metastasis of a lun\\ngcarcinoma. Primary malignancies that most commonly metastasize to the kidney are lung, breast, gastrointestinal tumors and melanoma. Renal metastases usually occur late in the cour\\nse of a known malignancy as part of widespread disease. In rare cases a renal metastasis may manifest as a solitary lesion and may be hard to differentiate from a renal cell carcino\\nma. A percutaneous biopsy can be performed to solve this problem. Multiple liver and renal metastases. Thrombus in the left renal vein (arrow). Renal metastases are typically small,\\n multifocal and bilateral, with an infiltrative growth pattern. They show mild enhancement, much less than that of the normal renal parenchyma. Metastases can also be hypervascular \\nhowever, as in melanoma, and sometimes breast cancer. The image shows a patient with multiple renal metastases. Notice the tumor thrombus in the left renal vein. Here a patient with\\n lung cancer. There is a metastasis in the left kidney and there are multiple lymph node metastases (arrows). If this was the only presentation, it would be difficult to differentia\\nte from a renal cell carcinoma with lymph node metastases.\\nInfection:\\nPyelonephritis and renal abscess can be tumor mimics, but in most cases the history and the clinical findings help you to make the right diagnosis. In this case there are hypodense \\nareas in both kidneys. Based on the imaging alone the main differential is multifocal pyelonephritis, lymphoma and metastases. This patient had a urinary tract infection and episode\\ns of flank pain and there was no history of a primary tumor or lymphoma. So the diagnosis is pyelonephritis. A CT scan 4 months later shows normal enhancement of both kidneys; the r\\nenal abnormalities on the first scan were therefore consistent with an episode of multifocal pyelonephritis. Renal abscess is usually a complication of acute pyelonephritis and pati\\nents present with urinary tract infection, flank pain and fever. On CT a renal abscess usually presents as a non-specific homogeneous low attenuation lesion or as a complex cystic l\\nesion. Cystic lesion with thick enhancing rim and infiltration of perirenal fat in a patient with a renal abscess The renal abscess may have a thick irregular enhancing wall with in\\nfiltration of the perirenal fat (figure). In patients with an atypical clinical presentation the complex cystic appearance and extension into the perirenal fat may simulate a renal \\ncell carcinoma. This patient had a typical presentation with right flank pain and laboratory findings consistent with a urinary tract infection. The ultrasound image shows a hypoech\\nogenic lesion with some echolucency, which indicates a fluid-containing component. This proved to be an abscess. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephriti\\ns an uncommon condition caused by a chronic granulomatous infection with accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages. Frequently there is an obstructing stone with dilatation of calyces\\n. It results in diffuse renal destruction, but can be segmental as well. Renal enlargement is present in all patients and in some cases macroscopic fat can be seen. Here another exa\\nmple of a xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. There is destruction of the right kidney, multiple calculi and surrounding fibrofatty proliferation. This appearance may resemble a lip\\nosarcoma.\\nInfarction:\\nRenal infarction Renal infarction usually results from thromboembolismin cardiovascular disease. The common clinical presentation is acute flank pain and hematuria. In the acute pha\\nse CT will show a wedge-shaped area of decreased attenuation followed in a later stage by atrophy. When the whole kidney is infarcted, the kidney will be enlarged and of low attenua\\ntion. Only the outer cortex may still enhance through collaterals resulting in a cortical rim sign. Here another case of renal infarction. Infarction in right kidney and spleen in a\\n patient with multiple systemic emboli.\\nPitfalls:\\nPseudo-enhancement in a renal cyst.\\nPseudo-enhancement:\\nPseudo-enhancement is a pitfall to be aware of in the evaluation of renal masses. As mentioned before a small difference in Hounsfield units (< 20 HU) can be measured in a renal cys\\nt on contrast-enhanced CT images due to beam-hardening. This case shows pseudo-enhancement in a lesion which proved to be a cyst at MRI. Dromedary hump\\nDromedary hump:\\nProminent columns of Bertin, bulging of the renal contour and focal renal hypertrophy can look like a renal mass on ultrasound, unenhanced images and CT in the nephrogenic phase. In\\n the corticomedullary phase the normal corticomedullary pattern in these pseudotumors can be appreciated, distinguishing them from real lesions. Suspected renal mass of the left kid\\nney on ultrasound. CT shows a bulging of the left renal contour, commonly referred to as a dromedary hump. Pseudotumor.

The etiology is controversial and is probably due to elevated upper esophageal\\npressure, cricopharyngeus dysfunction and reflux.

The relationship between hiatus hernia, reflux and reflux esophagitis is controversial and poorly understood. Most pa\\ntients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have hernias. Many patients with hiatus hernias do not have reflux. Many patients with reflux do not have hiatus hernias. Presence\\n of reflux correlates poorly with GERD.\\nA sliding hiatus hernia is of doubtful significance when an isolated finding in the absence of clinical or imaging findings of esophagitis. Diagnosis of GERD is based on imaging or \\nendoscopic findings of esophagitis, not presence of a hiatus hernia. Sliding hernia On the left initially, GE junction is below the esophageal hiatus. Later, stomach protrudes throu\\ngh hiatus. Neither the hernia or stricture (arrow) due to reflux esophagitis were visible early in the examination. Paraesophageal hernia Large hernias can cause symptoms, and with \\nprogressive hiatal widening, increasing protrusion and rotation of the stomach can lead to gastric volvulus that can be complicated by hemorrhage, obstruction, strangulation, perfor\\nation. On the left two examples. On the far left gas filled gastric fundus (asterisk) protrudes through hiatus but GE junction (arrow) is below diaphragm. Next to it a paraesophagea\\nl hernia with most of 'upside down' stomach in chest with greater curvature (arrows) flipped up. On the left a mixed hernia. Distal esophagus is adjacent to the herniated gastric fu\\nndus, but unlike a paraesophageal hernia, the gastroesophageal junction (arrow) is above rather than below the diaphragm.\\nInflammation and Infection:\\nGastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is the most common cause of esophagitis.

              " Document(page_content=\"Axial slices through the heart Cardiac CT with ECG triggering offers good image quality of the heart when compared to CT performed for other purposes. As in any other field of radio\\nlogy, analysis of the acquired images requires a systematic approach. First of all, it is important to understand that the orientation of the heart in the human body differs from th\\nat of other anatomic structures: the right ventricle, for example, does not lie completely on the right, but more anterior. The left ventricle does not lie on the left, but more pos\\nterior. Also, the heart does not always maintain the same position within the mediastinum - in young people it tends to have a vertical orientation, whereas in older people it tends\\n to rest on the diaphragm, a more horizontal orientation. Cardiologists analyze the heart using cardiac axes. These axes are also used in cardiac CT/MR and must be reconstructed in \\norder to assess the heart properly. Axial slices, such as those imaged on the left, are useful for a global assessment of the morphology of the heart and its relation to the pericar\\ndium. 4-chamber view. RA=right atrium, RV=right ventricle, LA=left atrium, LV=left ventricle\\n4-chamber view:\\nOn the left is a 4-chamber view, achieved by rotating upwards from the apex of the heart on the axial slices. In this axis, the right ventricle is projected next to the right atrium\\n, and the left ventricle next to the left atrium. The mitral valve comes into view and - depending on the contrast protocol - the tricuspid valve may also be visible. Another featur\\ne of this cardiac axis is that the apex of the heart is well demarcated.\\nNote that the apex is formed by the left ventricle. 3-chamber view. LA=left atrium, Ao=aorta, LV=left ventricle\\n3-chamber view:\\nWhen the border between the mitral and aortic valves is localized on the axial slices and the images are rotated from this point, a 3-chamber view like the image on the left can be \\nreconstructed. On this image, the left atrium, left ventricle, mitral-, aortic valve and proximal aorta ascendens are visible. 5-chamber view. RA=right atrium, RV=right ventricle, A\\no=aorta, LA=left atrium, LV=left ventricle\\n5-chamber view:\\nOn the left is an image of a 5-chamber view, which is similar to the 4-chamber view, but additionally displays the aortic valve and left ventricular outflow tract. This view is achi\\neved by rotating the 4-chamber view a little more cranially. 2-chamber view. LA=left atrium, LV=left ventricle\\n2-chamber view:\\nThe 2-chamber view in the image on the left is achieved by rotating the images perpendicularly to the mitral valve and parallel to the cardiac septum. This axis gives an overview of\\n the left atrium ventricle and mitral valve. It is a good view for analyzing ventricular function, especially that of the inferior and anterior walls. For attaining functional data,\\n consecutive short axes must be reconstructed making use of the 3- and 4-chamber views.\\nCardiac anatomy from right to left:\\nAxial (left) and coronal oblique (right) reconstructions of the heart, depicting the right atrium and its main contributing blood vessels: the coronary sinus (blue arrow) and superi\\nor and inferior vena cava. IVC=inferior vena cava, A=anterior, SVC=superior vena cava\\nRight atrium:\\nThe cardiac anatomy will be discussed in the order of normal blood flow: from the right to the left. In the normal situation, contrast will be injected intravenously - usually in th\\ne arm - reaching the right atrium via the superior vena cava. The right atrium has an anterolateral position in the heart, and lies inferior to the left atrium. The superior vena ca\\nva enters through the roof of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava enters the right atrium from below near the cardiac septum. Another structure that carries blood towards the r\\night atrium is the coronary sinus, (venous return of the coronaries) which enters anterior to, and just to the left of the inferior vena cava. Axial (left) and coronal (right) recon\\nstructions showing the crista terminalis (blue arrows) and its location in the right atrium\\nCrista terminalis:\\nIn the right atrium lies the crista terminalis, a muscular ridge that runs from the entrance of the superior- to that of the inferior vena cava. This structure separates the smooth \\npart of the right atrium - the sinus venosus - from the trabecularized right atrial appendage.\\nOn the images on the left it is visible as a smooth linear structure (blue arrows).

RA=right atrium, RV=right ventricle, LV=left ventricle\\nRight ventricle:\\nBlood leaves the right atrium and enters the right ventricle via the tricuspid valve. This valve has three leaflets and three papillary muscles, which partially insert on the septum\\n (in contrast to the papillary muscles of the mitral valve, which do not). The right ventricle is shaped differently to the left ventricle: the left ventricle is cylindrical in shap\\ne and the cavity of the right ventricle is effectively wrapped around it. The right ventricle also has a thinner wall which is more trabecularized, especially towards the apex. The \\nmoderator band is another distinguishing feature of the right ventricle.\\nIt runs from the septum to the lateral wall of the right ventricle, and plays a key role in the electrophysiological conduction of the right ventricle's free wall (blue arrows).

The blue arrow indicates the crista supraventricularis\\nPulmonary valve:\\nNext, blood runs towards the pulmonary valve - first entering the smooth, muscular infundibulum of the right ventricle. The pulmonary valve has three cusps, and is separated from th\\ne tricuspid valve by a thick muscle known as the crista supraventricularis (blue arrow in the image on the left). This differs from the left ventricular outflow tract, where the mit\\nral and aortic valves lie side by side.

For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com\\nIntroduction:\\nAccidental ingestion of sharp foreign bodies is a potentially life-threatening event.  \\nIf a sharp foreign body gets stuck in the pharynx or esophagus, the patient will usually notice its presence and will seek medical help immediately. If, however,  the sharp foreign \\nbody, unnoticed by the patient,  is able to reach the stomach, it may penetrate at some point, the wall of the stomach, small or large bowel, giving rise to atypical and treacherous\\n symptoms. \\nThis often leads to serious delay and may even be fatal. This table contains the key points in the history of the patient. \\nThe ingested foreign bodies are fish or poultry bones and wooden sticks as tooth picks and cocktail sticks.  \\nPatients virtually never remember swallowing, and even show disbelief when confronted with the diagnosis. The average age is 60 years and many patients wear denture plates. \\nPatients with perforation of small or large bowel often have a previous laparotomy in their history. Perforating foreign bodies in stomach and bowel are rarely clinically considered\\n and are increasingly recognized by the use of US and CT, so there is a key role for the radiologist, in primary detection and also in guiding minimal invasive treatment. This table\\n contains the key points in the clinical, US and CT findings. Pain is variable and atypical. \\nCRP usually rises quickly in the first 24 hours. Perforation of the stomach always occurs in the prepyloric region. \\nAbscesses may occur in the peritoneal cavity, abdominal wall,  iliopsoas muscle and liver. \\nThe foreign body itself may be rather inconspicuous and is easily missed. \\nThis requires awareness and active searching on CT scan This table contains the key points of the treatment. Whenever possible, endoscopical removal is the best option, followed by \\nminimal invasive surgery, guided by the US and CT findings. \\nAbscesses can be drained percutaneously, or evacuated surgically together with removal of the foreign body. In all instances, antibiotics are mandatory. \\nAntibiotics alone may be the definitive treatment, especially in case of small fish bones  and after successful abscess drainage. Rarely, the sharp foreign body may cause local perf\\noration and yet leave the bowel naturally.\\nThis is called pinprick-and-pass.\\nEpidemiology and pathophysiology:\\nHyperdense bones in three asymptomatic patients It is unknown how often sharp foreign bodies on their journey through the GI tract actually perforate stomach and bowel. \\nProbably many fishbones eventually pass with the stool without any problem. \\nWhen specifically looked for, it is not uncommon to find hyperdense bones (arrow) in the bowel lumen, as in these three asymptomatic patients. The most frequently encountered penetr\\nating sharp foreign bodies are fish bones, chicken bones and wooden sticks as toothpicks or cocktail sticks. The vast majority of patients do not recall having swallowed such an obj\\nect, and when confronted with the sharp object, often show remarkable disbelief. Many patients wear denture plates that might render their palatum less sensitive. It is not always p\\nossible to differentiate bones from wooden sticks on CT, but fishbones are generally rather hyperdense and curvilinear, while wooden sticks are less hyperdense and more straight. Ha\\nlf of the patients with small bowel perforation, have a history of a previous abdominal surgery. Adhesions cause local kinking of the bowel loops inhibiting the sharp foreign body t\\no “take the corner”. Once a sharp object penetrates the wall of stomach or bowel, omentum and mesentery will try to wall-off the ensuing perforation. Often, an abscess will develop:\\n  in the peritoneal cavity, in the liver, in the abdominal wall or  in the iliopsoas muscle. The foreign body may lie within the abscess, but also remain at its periphery. Sometimes\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 412}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=', significant migration of the object may occur. One third of the perforating sharp foreign bodies lies within reach of either gastroscopy or colonoscopy. This is obviously the best\\n option for the patient. A 59-year old woman with atypical upper epigastric pain for two days. US reveals remarkable wall thickening of the prepyloric antrum, harbouring a hyperecho\\nic, curvilinear structure (arrowheads), suspect for a fishbone. CT confirms the diagnosis. \\nNote how the fishbone (arrow) could easily be missed on the coronal CT alone.\\nUneventful  recovery after endoscopic removal. US and CT show a fishbone perforating the stomach wall just before the pylorus. At gastroscopy no fishbone was found, but only local m\\nucosal swelling with a central ulceration (arrow). Deep instrumentation with a  large forceps into this area eventually succeeded in grabbing the fishbone. A 74-year old woman prese\\nnts with deeply located, lower abdominal pain since 3 weeks. Lab: 15 leukocytes, CRP 150. She had multiple gynaecological operations in the past. CT was done and revealed a bony for\\neign body, which, at both ends, appeared to perforate the sigmoid. Endovaginal US confirmed that the foreign body traversed the sigmoid lumen, so colonoscopic removal was possible. \\nDuring the endoscopical procedure, the chicken bone had to be broken in two parts in order to be safely removed. Uneventful recovery with help of antibiotics. If the foreign body is\\n not reachable for the endoscope and is well accessible for the surgeon,  in principle surgical removal of the foreign body is indicated. This 33-year old man (with a previous bowel\\n resection at age four) presented with epigastric pain and a CRP of 155. US and CT confirmed a bony structure (arrows) perforating an adhesive small bowel. At mini-laparotomy a shar\\np 6 cm bone was removed. The patient ate Peking duck two days earlier. A vital 83-year old man presented with acute upper abdominal pain and a CRP of 90. CT found a bony structure s\\ntuck in the jejunum. After 24 hours of conservative therapy with antibiotics, the pain did not diminish and the CRP went up to 230. At surgery a sharp, perforating bone chip could e\\nasily be removed by means of a small jejunal incision, there was no need for bowel resection. The patient made a quick recovery and now, eleven years later, at 94, he  is still in p\\nerfect condition. He can still not imagine that he ever swallowed such a large bone chip In case of deeply located abscesses as liver abscesses, percutaneous drainage is indicated i\\nn combination with long-term antibiotics. In some patients  this may be the definitive treatment. This 61-year old lady presented with a large fishbone-related liver abscess. She wa\\ns obese and had several other contraindications for surgery. After multiple percutaneous drainage procedures and ten weeks of antibiotics, she eventually recovered, with the fishbon\\ne still in place, apparently encapsulated. Now, ten years later, she is still doing fine. At times, it may be very difficult to find the foreign body at laparoscopy or open surgery.\\n This patient presented with upper abdominal pain and a CRP of 245. US and CT revealed a slightly hyperdense, straight foreign body, probably a cocktail stick (arrowheads) . At surg\\nery two days later the liver abscess was evacuated, but the foreign body was not found. Afterwards  the patient did well on antibiotics. On day 15, CT showed resolution of the absce\\nss with the foreign body (arrowheads) still in situ. Eventually, the patient recovered with long-term antibiotic treatment. Wooden sticks incidentally may be isodense with the bowel\\n or liver tissue they traverse, and thus may be hardly or not visible on CT scan. In these cases, focused US can be of help. In patient A, CT findings of an air-bubble, fat strandin\\ng and local bowel wall thickening, suggested a local perforation, but no foreign body was seen. Immediate US of this area  unequivocally revealed a sharp foreign body (arrows) pierc\\ning through the bowel (b.) wall into the surrounding inflamed fat (*). In patient B, antral wall thickening and a nearby liver abscess, suggested a perforating foreign body, which h\\nowever could not be identified on CT. US, performed with knowledge of the CT findings, easily detected the, apparently isodense, foreign body. (st. = stomach) Often no abscess occur\\ns and the fishbone, after migration, becomes encapsulated. Antibiotics may be of help in the encapsulation process. This 48 year old woman was submitted with severe periumbilical pa\\nin since 12 hours (Lab: 15 leukocytes, CRP 7). \\nThe next day the pain subsided, but the CRP went up to 65. US of the periumbilical area, showed edematous wall thickening of small bowel (b.) with normal peristalsis. \\nThere was a tiny fluid collection (f.) and inflammation of the  hyperechoic and non-compressible mesentery (*). Subsequent CT confirmed small bowel wall thickening (b.) and fat stra\\nnding (*) in the mesentery. In the left paracolic gutter, a fishbone (arrow) was found. \\nApparently the fishbone, after perforating the jejunum, did migrate to that spot. \\nSubsequent laparoscopical exploration was unable to identify the fishbone. \\nShe made an uneventful recovery with antibiotics. CT scan, performed for other reasons 18 months later, showed slight migration of the fish bone, apparently well-encapsulated. \\nPatient is still doing well eight years later. In case of relatively mild symptoms in patients with small, perforating fishbones without an abscess, primary antibiotic treatment  ma\\ny be a good first option. These three different patients all made an uneventful recovery with antibiotics only. Sometimes nature is very mild. \\nThis 72 year old lady presented with acute epigastric pain and a CRP of 180, caused by a fishbone, perforating her stomach. Only proton pump inhibitors were given. \\nHer symptoms rapidly subsided and her CRP was normal again in three days. \\nShe  made a full recovery, and 11 years later is still doing fine. Two different patients with an encapsulated fishbone in the wall of the antrum as coincidental finding on CT, perf\\normed for other reasons. Both patients did not recall a period of upper epigastric pain and had unchanged CT images for many years. In case of an abdominal wall abscess, surgery can\\n be done in order  to drain the abscess and remove the foreign body. In this patient, only a small peri-umbilical incision allowed evacuation of pus and removal of the fishbone. Thi\\ns 58-year old patient presented with pain LLQ and a CRP of 105, suspect for diverticulitis. US found a ovoid mass of inflamed fat (arrowheads) lateral of the sigmoid, suggestive of \\nepiploic appendagitis. Subsequent CT revealed a straight, hyperdense foreign body (arrows)  surrounded by fat stranding.\\nThe patient was treated with antibiotics. One week later an abscess did develop, which was percutaneously drained. Eight weeks later a cocktail stick was removed as an elective proc\\nedure.\\nPerforating diseases of the GI tract:\\nCauses of perforation:\\nIf at US or CT bowel wall thickening is found in combination with fat stranding, free air configurations and/or abscess formation, it is not always clear what the underlying cause i\\ns. The mnemonic PSI-ABCD may be helpful: In the table, the star-classification indicate the frequency of these potentially perforating conditions.\\nIn 99,99 % of cases, one of these seven conditions is the cause of the perforation or walled-off perforation. In our hospital we have a relatively large number of sharp, perforating\\n foreign bodies of 3-4 cases per year. \\nThis is partially explained by a large immigrant population, eating exotic fish species. Especially Surinamese people who make up 30 % of our patients, are responsible for 70% of th\\ne fishbone perforations.\\nPinprick-and-pass:\\nA sharp foreign body may cause a perforation, but may yet pass normally with the stool  (”pinprick-and-pass”). This 85-year old man presented with severe localized pain, focal perit\\nonitis and a CRP of 200, clinically suspect for appendicitis.  \\nUS showed a small focal area of inflamed hyperechoic fat (arrowheads), harbouring  a little fluid (*) and an ill-understood reflection (white arrow). \\nThe presumed US diagnosis was epiploic appendagitis with a small central area of hemorrhage. CT confirmed local fat stranding and  detected an air bubble as well as slight wall thic\\nkening of a neighbouring small bowel loop.   \\nUsing the mnemonic PSI-ABCD, all conditions were excluded, except for a sharp foreign body. After specific searching a fishbone was detected in the cecum (green arrows on CT). Appar\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 413}),\n",

A 81-year old man with pr\\nogressive epigastric pain for 24 hours. \\nUS revealed an aortic aneurysm of 5.2 cm.

Initial US shows wall thickening of the sigmoid, inflamed fat (*) and a fecolith within a diverticulum (white arrowhead). \\nCloser inspection of the area where the most inflamed, non-compressible fat (green arrowheads and *) was seen, revealed a foreign body (arrows).

Endoscopic US confirmed the fishbone entirely within the liver abscess\\n (arrow), so endoscopic removal was impossible. At surgery, the abscess was drained and the fishbone removed. A 75 year old man with a clinically suspected iliopsoas abscess.

Preoperative MR can help to prevent recurrence. I\\nn this review we will address the anatomy, pathogenesis, classification and scanning protocol of perianal fistulas. by Susanne Tonino and Robin Smithuis\\nAnatomy:\\nThe anatomical anal canal extends from the perineal skin to the linea dentata. Surgically, the anal canal extends from the perineal skin to the anorectal ring. This is the circular \\nupper border of the puborectal muscle which is digitally palpable upon rectal examination. The anorectal ring lies approximately 1-1,5 cm above the linea dentata. The total length o\\nf the surgical anal canal is about 4-5 cm. The anal sphincter is comprised of three layers: Puborectal muscle forming a 'sling' The puborectal muscle has its origin on both sides of\\n the pubic symphysis, forming a 'sling' around the anorectum. The puborectal muscle is contracted at rest and accounts for the 80? angulation of the anorectal junction. It relaxes d\\nuring defecation. Coronal T2W-image On axial and coronal MR-images the different layers of the anal sphincter and the surrounding structures can be displayed perfectly.\\nPerianal fistula:\\nA perianal fistula is an abnormal connection between the epithilialised surface of the anal canal and the skin. The causes of perianal fistulas:\\nClassification:\\nThe most widely used classification is the Parks Classification which distinguishes four kinds of fistula: intersphincteric, transsphincteric, suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric.\\n The most common fistulas are the intersphincteric and the transsphincteric. The extrasphincteric fistula is uncommon and only seen in patients who had multiple operations. In these\\n cases the connection with the original fistula tract to the bowel is lost. A superficial fistula is a fistula that has no relation to the sphincter or the perianal glands and is no\\nt part of the Parks classification. These are more often due to Crohns disease or anorectal procedures such as haemorrhoidectomy or sphincterotomy.\\nMR Protocol and Reporting:\\nProtocol A localizer in three directions is needed in order to align the T2 sequences axial and coronal to the anal canal. Any localizer that properly displays the anal canal can be\\n used. We use a TRUE FISP, which is the name that Siemens uses for a steady-state precession gradient-echo sequence (GE: FIESTA, Philips: balanced FFE). Perianal fistula: axial T2WI\\n without fatsat (left) and with fatsat (right) T2W images without fatsat better display the anatomy, while the fatsat images better depict the fistulas. Reporting When you describe \\na fistula, it is important to mention the following characteristics: The drawing on the left illustrates the anal clock, which is the surgeon's view of the perianal region when the \\npatient is in the supine lithotomy position (2). This scheme corresponds to the orientation of axial MR images of the perianal region.\\nExamples of Perirectal Fistulas:\\nIntersphincteric fistula:\\nOn the left axial T2W images with and without fat saturation. An intersphincteric fistula is located at 6 o'clock. Continue with coronal images. On the coronal image the fistula run\\ns caudally towards the skin. There is no connection with the external sphincter. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Use the arrows to scroll through the images.

The defect through the internal and external sphincter at 6 o'clock is clearly visible and more apparent o\\nn the fat sat images. Transsphincteric fistula with sphincter defect at 11 o'clock On the left axial T2W-fatsat images of a transsphincteric fistula with the mucosal opening at 11 o\\n'clock. On the left an example of a suprasphincteric fistula. There are two tracts in the ischioanal region. The right sided tract runs over the puborectal muscle (asterisk) and the\\n mucosal opening lies at the\\nlevel of the linea dentata (black arrow).\\nExtrasphincteric fistula:\\nOn the left coronal T2W-images of a small abscess in the left ischioanal fossa, the fistula runs through the levator ani. It is therefore above the sphincter complex and extrasphinc\\nteric. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Use the arrows to scroll through the images. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Use the arrows to scroll through the images.\\nComplex fistula:\\nOn the left an example of a complex fistula. Two tracts in the left buttock form a single tract (no. 1-2). This fistula breaks through the external sphincter (no. 4). In the intersp\\nhincteric space it divides again into two tracts (no. 5). One ends blindly in the intersphincteric space (no. 6).

Seton fistulotomy is a technique where a rubber ligature or vessel loop\\n is pulled through the\\nfistula, it then is tightened every 2 weeks or so in order to obtain pressure necrosis so that\\nthe Seton is slowly pulled through the muscle. This has the advantage that the muscle is slowly cut and fibroses at the same time in order\\nto cause as little damage as possible to the sphincter complex.

Siegel and Valerie Niehe\\nMallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, St. Louis, MO and the Medical Centre Haaglanden in the Hague, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2011-07-10 This review is based on a presentation by Marilyn Siegel and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Valerie Niehe. Marilyn Siegel is specialized in pe\\ndiatric and chest radiology. In this review we will discuss the most common non-vascular mediastinal masses in the chest. In Pediatric Chest CT part II we will discuss the most comm\\non vascular anomalies of the aorta, pulmonary vessels and systemic veins in the chest.\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\nThe differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass is based on identifying its location in anterior, middle or posterior mediastinum and attenuation: soft tissue, fat, fluid and enhan\\ncement.\\nNormal anatomy:\\nThymus:\\nIn infants and young children (\\nIn older children, the thymus gradually assumes a triangular or arrowhead configuration with straight or concave margins. By 15 years of age it is triangular in nearly all individua\\nls. Marked lobularity of the thymus is always abnormal. In prepubertal children, the thymus is homogeneous. The attenuation value is equal to that of skeletal muscle. In adolescents\\n it may be heterogeneous, containing areas of fat. Anatomic variations include extension into the posterior mediastinum or upper neck. Clues to the diagnosis are: The figure shows a\\n thymus that extends cranially to the brachiocephalic vessels. It is contiguous with the normal thymus and extend between the superior vena cava and the trachea. There is no mass ef\\nfect.\\nNormal Lymph nodes:\\nThere are no well-established data concerning size of normal lymph nodes in infants and young children. Mediastinal lymph nodes are generally not seen on CT prior to puberty. The no\\ndes should then not exceed 1 cm in the widest dimension. The azygoesophageal recess is dextroconvex in children younger than 6 years of age, straight in children between 5 and 12 ye\\nars of age, and concave in adolescents and adults. Recognizing the normal dextroconvex appearance is important so that it is not mistaken for lymphadenopathy.\\nAnterior Mediastinal Masses:\\nAnterior mediastinal masses are usually of thymic origin.\\nHodgkin lymphoma:\\nLymphoma is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children, with Hodgkin lymphoma occurring three to four times more frequently than non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Calcifications or c\\nystic areas, due to ischemic necrosis consequent to rapid tumor growth, can be seen. Lymphadenopathy from lymphoma has varied appearances, ranging from mildly enlarged nodes in a si\\nngle area to large conglomerate soft tissue masses in multiple regions. Thymic enlargement and lymphadenopathy show minimal if any enhancement after intravenous contrast. Additional\\n findings include airway narrowing and compression of vascular structures. PET-CT of Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma in children is more common in the second decade of life. The l\\nymphomatous mass is most common located in the anterior mediastinum and reflects lymphadenopathy or infiltration and enlargement of the thymus. The enlarged thymus has a quadrilater\\nal shape with convex, lobular lateral borders. Hodgkin lymphoma The chest film shows the typical features of Hodgkin lymphoma, e.g., an anterior mediastinal mass. Hodgkin lymphoma T\\nhe CT-images of the same patient show a large soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinum, which arises in the thymus. There is associated paratracheal adenopathy (arrow). Hodgkin \\nlymphoma Two more cases of Hodgkin lymphoma. Again these cases show an anterior mediastinal mass and paratracheal adenopathy. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma\\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma:\\nNon-Hodgkin disease in children occurs in the first and second decade of life. The disease usually involves the nodes in the chest (paratracheal, subcarinal and hilar). The extensio\\nn of the disease is not contiguous, it can skip a location. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma Non-Hodgkin disease, in contrast to Hodgkin disease, often spares the thymus. In this case, enlarged\\n lymph nodes are seen in the right paratracheal , hilar and subcarinal areas. Thymic hyperplasia\\nThymic hyperplasia:\\nThymic hyperplasia is another cause of thymic enlargement.\\nIn childhood, thymic hyperplasia is most often 'rebound' hyperplasia associated with chemotherapy, particularly therapy with corticosteroids. Rebound hyperplasia may be observed dur\\ning the course of chemotherapy or after therapy completion and occurs 3 to 10 months after the start of chemotherapy. The mechanism of hyperplasia is believed to be initial depletio\\nn of lymphocytes from the cortical portion of the gland due to high serum levels of glucocorticoids, followed by repopulation of the cortical lymphocytes when the cortisone levels r\\neturn to normal. On CT, hyperplasia appears as diffuse enlargement of the thymus, with preservation of the normal triangular shape. The definition of thymic hyperplasia is a > 50 % \\nincrease in volume of the thymus.\\nCT, MRI of PET cannot differentiate rebound hyperplasia from infiltration of the thymus by tumor. The absence of other active disease and a gradual decrease in thymus size on serial\\n CT's supports the diagnosis of rebound hyperplasia. The thymus usually returns to its normal size in 3 to 6 months. LEFT: Thymoma. RIGHT: Thymic carcinoma.\\nThymoma:\\nThymomas are common and account for 20% of mediastinal neoplasms. Thymic carcinomas are extremely rare and acount for less than 1% of all thymic tumors. The images show a thymoma on\\n the left and a carcinoma on the right. The thymic carcinoma has invaded the superior vena cava (arrow). Benign mature teratoma\\nGerm-cell tumors:\\nGerm-cell tumors are the most common cause of a fat containing lesions in the anterior mediastinum and the second most common cause of an anterior mediastinal mass in children. Appr\\noximately 90 % are benign germ-cell tumors. Most arise in the thymus. On CT, a benign teratoma is a well-defined, thick-wall cystic mass containing a variable mixture of water, calc\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 416}),\n",

Benign mature teratoma Mature teratomas can be very large and still be benign. Malignant teratoma Malignant teratomas make up 10 % of all ter\\natomas.\\nThey tend to have irregular or nodular walls and a predominance of soft tissue components. They also may show pulmonary or liver metastases and chest wall invasion. The most common \\nnonteratomatous germ-cell tumors in the pediatric population are choriocarcinoma, embryonal cell cancer and yolk-sac cancer.\\nThymolipoma:\\nThymolipoma is an infrequent fat-containing thymic tumor.\\nAt CT, it appears as a heterogeneous mass containing fat and soft tissue elements. Calcifications are absent. Thymolipoma does not have a capsule and does not have any mass effect.\\nLymphangioma or Cystic hygroma:\\nLymphangiomas are developmental tumors of the lymphatic system. In the mediastinum they are almost always an inferior extension of a cervical lymphangioma. Isolated mediastinal invo\\nlvement is rare. Lymphangioma is a benign, but aggressive tumor that shows mass effect and may encase vessels and other structures. It typically affects infants younger than 6 month\\ns of age. At CT it appears as nonenhancing, thin-walled, multiloculated mass with near water attenuation. T2 with fatsupression, transversal and coronal MRI may sometimes be used to\\n better delineate the extension of the lesion. The MRI in this patient shows a cystic mass in the neck extending into the right axilla and mediastinum. The tumor encases vessels. Th\\ne presence of contrast enhancement of the wall or internal septations suggests superimposed infection or a hemangiomatous component.\\nThymic cysts:\\nThymic cysts are usually congenital lesions resulting from persistence of the thymopharyngeal duct. They can also occur after thoracotomy. Typically, they are thinwalled, homogeneou\\ns masses of near water attenuation on CT. The attenuation value may be higher than that of simple cysts when the contents are proteinaceous or hemorrhagic rather than serous. In chi\\nldren thymoma, thymic carcinoma and goiter are so uncommon, that you should put them very low in your differential diagnosis.\\nMiddle Mediastinal masses:\\nIn the middle mediastinum we will find foregut duplication cysts or lymph nodes. Foregut cysts in the middle mediastinum are classified as bronchogenic or enteric. Bronchogenic cyst\\ns are lined by respiratory epithelium and most are located in the subcarinal or right paratracheal area in close proximity to the trachea or bronchus. Enteric cysts are lined by gas\\ntrointestinal mucosa and are located in a paraspinal position in the middle to posterior mediastinum near the esophagus. Bronchogenic Cyst\\nBronchogenic Cysts:\\nThe images show a well defined lesion of water attenuation in close proximity to the trachea or bronchus, which is typical for a bronchogenic foregut cyst. Bronchogenic Cysts The im\\nages show more examples of bronchogenic cysts and their close proximity to the airway. Enteric cyst\\nEnteric foregut cyst:\\nThe images show a well defined lesion of water attenuation in the lower mediastinum in close proximity to the esophagus, which is typical for an enteric foregut cyst.\\nMediastinal lymphadenopathy:\\nMediastinal lymphadenopathy is usually caused by lymphoma or granulomatous disease. Metastatic disease from rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma or a Wilms tumor, is also a possibility. O\\nn CT, adenopathy can appear as discrete, round, soft tissue masses or as a single soft tissue mass with poorly defined margins. Calcification within lymph nodes suggests old healed \\ngranulomatous disease, fungal infection or metastatic disease from osteosarcoma. Areas of low attenuation suggest tuberculosis or fungal infection.\\nPosterior Mediastinal masses:\\nPosterior mediastinal masses are of neural origin in approximately 95 % of cases and may arise from sympathetic ganglion cells (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma or ganglioneuroma\\n) or from nerve sheaths (neurofibroma or schwannoma). In the first decade of life they are usually malignant, most commonly neuroblastoma. In the second decade or life they are usua\\nlly benign (ganglioneuroma, neurofibroma, rarely schwanoma). Neuroblastoma presenting as a mass in the posterior mediastinum\\nNeuroblastoma:\\nNeuroblastoma typically is fusiform in shape, of soft tissue density; 50% of thoracic tumors have calcifications. Neuroblastoma Neuroblastoma grows over several interspaces and freq\\nuently invades the vertebral canal. The CT-images show a calcified mass in the posterior mediastinum extending over several vertebrae, which grows into the vertebral canal. Neurobla\\nstoma On the MR-images the invasion of the vetebral canal is better seen (arrows). LEFT: Ganglioneuroma, RIGHT: Neurofibroma.\\nOther Neurogenic Tumors:\\nIn the 2nd decade other neurogenic tumors are seen like\\nganglioneuroma, neurofibroma and rarely schwanoma. They are round or oval in shape, smaller in size than ganglion cell tumors and usually extend over only one or two vertebrae. Both\\n types of tumor may cause pressure erosion of a rib and invade the spinal canal.\\nNeurenteric Cyst:\\nNeurogenic cysts contain neural and gastrointestinal element. They are commonly associated with vertebral anomalies and scoliosis. The cyst does not communicate with CSF. The cyst i\\ns well demarcated and has a near water attenuation value on CT and water signal intensity on MRI, as shown in the case on the left. Extramedullary hematopoiesis masses in the parasp\\ninal area and adjacent to the sternum.\\nExtramedullary hematopoiesis:\\nExtramedullary hematopoiesis accounts for less than 0.1 % of the lesions in the posterior mediastinum. It is characterized by formation of blood elements outside of the bone marrow.\\n It occurs with severe anemia. On CT it is seen as a paravertebral mass and occurs with coarse bone trabeculation in the adjacent vertebra.\\nPediatric Chest CT part II:\\nVascular Anomalies of Aorta, Pulmonary and Systemic vessels:\\nVascular Anomalies of Aorta, Pulmonary and Systemic vessels\\nCT contrast injection and protocols:\\nRobin Smithuis\\nRadiology department of the Rijnland Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:\\nPublicationdate 2014-06-01 Optimal contrast enhancement is important for a succesful diagnostic CT-scan.

Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the phases of enhancement. You can enlarge the images by clicking on it.\\nPhases of enhancement:\\nThe purpose of contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is to find pathology by enhancing the contrast between a lesion and the normal surrounding structures. Sometimes a lesion will be hypovasc\\nular compared to the normal tissue and in some cases a lesion will be hypervascular to the surrounding tissue in a certain phase of enhancement. So it is important to know in which \\nphase a CT should be performed depending on the pathology that you are looking for. Scroll through the images to see the enhancement in the different phases. This is the phase when \\nthe contrast is still in the arteries and has not enhanced the organs and other soft tissues.\\n* Late arterial phase - 35-40 sec p.i. or 15-20 sec after bolustracking. Sometimes also called \"arterial phase\" or \"early venous portal phase\", because some enhancement of the porta\\nl vein can be seen. All structures that get their bloodsupply from the arteries will show optimal enhancement.\\n* Hepatic or late portal phase - 70-80 sec p.i. or 50-60 sec after bolustracking. Although hepatic phase is the most accurate term, most people use the term \"late portal phase\". In \\nthis phase the liver parenchyma enhances through bloodsupply by the portal vein and you should see already some enhancement of the hepatic veins.\\n* Nephrogenic phase - 100 sec p.i. or 80 sec after bolustracking. This is when all of the renal parenchyma including the medulla enhances. Only in this phase you will be able to det\\nect small renal cell carcinomas.\\n* Delayed phase - 6-10 minutes p.i. or 6-10 minutes after bolustracking. Sometimes called \"wash out phase\" or \"equilibrium phase\". There is wash out of contrast in all abdominal str\\nuctures except for fibrotic tissue, because fibrotic tissue has a poor late wash out and will become relatively dense compared to normal tissue. This is comparable to late enhanceme\\nnt of infarcted scar tissue in cardiac MRI. Hypervascular lesion is best seen in late arterial phase.\\nTiming of CECT:\\nTiming of CT-series is important in order to grab the right moment of maximal contrast differences between a lesion and the normal parenchyma. The CT-images show an early arterial p\\nhase in comparison to a late arterial phase. The CT-images are of a patient who underwent two phases of arterial imaging at 18 and 35 seconds. In the early arterial phase we nicely \\nsee the arteries, but we only see some irregular enhancement within the liver. In the late arterial phase we can clearly identify multiple tumor masses. You have to adapt your proto\\ncol to the type of scanner, the speed of contrast injection and to the kind of patient that you are examining. If you have a single slice scanner, it will take about 20 seconds to s\\ncan the liver. For late arterial phase imaging 35 sec is the optimal time, so you start at about 25 seconds and end at about 45 seconds. However if you have a 64-slice scanner, you \\nwill be able to examine the whole liver in 4 seconds. So you start scanning at about 33 seconds, which is much later. In aterial phase imaging the time window is narrow, since you h\\nave only limited time before the surrounding liver will start to enhance and obscure a hypervascular lesion. For Late portal venous phase imaging it is different. Here you don\\'t wan\\nt to be too early, because you want to load the liver with contrast and it takes time for contrast to get from the portal vein into the liver parenchyma. Besides you have more time,\\n because the delayed or equilibrium phase starts at about 3-4 minutes. So you start at 75 seconds with whatever scanner you have.\\nTotal amount of contrast:\\nIn many protocols a standard dose is given related to the weight of the patient: In some protocols we always want to give the maximum dose of 150cc, like when you are looking for a \\npancreatic carcinoma or liver metastases. Patient with liver cirrhosis and multifocal HCC injected at 2.5ml/sec (left) and at 5ml/sec (right)\\nInjection rate:\\n5cc/sec through a 18 gauge i.v. catheter 3-4cc/sec through a 20 gauge pink venflon The upper images are of a patient with liver cirrhosis and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma exa\\nmined after contrast injection at 2.5ml/sec. Because of poor enhancement the examination was repeated at 5ml/sec. There is far better contrast enhancement and better tumor detection\\n.\\nOral contrast:\\nSome prefer to give positive oral contrast to mark the bowel. This however has some disadvantages: We use fat containing milk as negative oral contrast or if the patient doesn\\'t dri\\nnk milk we simply use water. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is also used, and Volumen®, which is a low density barium suspension. PEG and Volumen® have the advantage that there is better\\n bowel distension. The CT-image shows nice enhancement of the normal bowel wall (yellow arrows) and no enhancement of the infarcted bowel (red arrows). This would not be visible if \\npositive oral contrast was given.\\nRectal contrast:\\nRectal contrast is given in cases of suspected bowel perforation or anastomosis leakage. We use positive contrast: 750 cc water with 50 cc non-ionic water soluable contrast. More in\\nformation is given in the protocol anastomosis leakage.\\nLiver:\\nHypervascular tumor (left) enhances in late arterial phase. Hypovascular tumor (right) enhances poorly and is best seen in the hepatic phase\\nDual blood supply:\\nThe conspicuity of a liver lesion depends on the attenuation difference between the lesion and the normal liver. On a non enhanced CT-scan (NECT) liver tumors are not visible, becau\\nse the inherent contrast between tumor tissue and the surrounding liver parenchyma is too low. When we give i.v. contrast, it is important to understand, that there is a dual blood \\nsupply to the liver. Normal parenchyma is supplied for 80% by the portal vein and only for 20% by the hepatic artery, so the normal parenchyma will enhance maximally in the hepatic \\nphase at 70-80 sec p.i. and only a little bit in the late arterial phase at 35-40 sec p.i.. All liver tumors however get 100% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery. So a hyp\\nervascular tumor will be best seen in the late arterial phase. A hypovascular liver tumor however will enhance poorly in the late arterial phase, because it is hypovascular and the \\nsurrounding liver does also enhance poorly in that phase. This tumor is best seen when the surrounding tissue enhances, i.e. in the late portal (or hepatic) phase at 75-80 sec p.i. \\nThis figure is to summarize the enhancement patterns. In the late arterial phase at 35 sec hypervascular lesions like HCC, FNH, adenoma and hemangioma wil enhance optimally, while t\\nhe normal parenchyma shows only minimal enhancement. Hypovascular lesions like metastases, cysts and abscesses will not enhance and are best seen in the hepatic phase at 70 sec p.i.\\n Fibrotic lesions like cholangiocarcinoma and fibrotic metastases hold the contrast much longer than normal parenchyma. They are best seen in the delayed phase at 600 sec p.i. This \\nlate enhancement is comparable to what is seen in cardiac infarcts in MRI of the heart. If you want to characterize a liver lesion, you need maximum contrast at a maximum flow rate,\\n i.e. 150cc contrast at 5cc/sec. through a 18 gauge green venflon. In most cases you also want to scan the whole abdomen. You can do this either at 35 sec or 70 sec p.i. We do not r\\noutinely perform a NECT in order keep the radiation dose as low as possible. When you know in advance, that you are dealing with hypovascular metastases, a hepathic phase at 70 sec \\np.i. is sufficient.\\nPancreas:\\nPancreatic carcinoma is best imaged at 35 sec p.i. Liver metastases are best imaged at 70 sec p.i.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 418}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Pancreatic carcinoma:\\nPancreatic carcinoma is a hypovascular tumor and is best detected in the late arterial phase at 35-40 sec p.i. when the normal glandular tissue enhances optimally and the hypovascul\\nar tumor does not. Metastases in the liver are best detected at 70-80 sec p.i., when the liver parenchyma enhances optimally. In some cases it can be difficult to differentiate a pa\\nncreatic carcinoma from a focal chronic pancreatitis. A NECT can be included in the protocol to detect calcifications in the pancreas, but we do not use that in our standard protoco\\nl. Some radiologists use a longer delay for scanning of the pancreas at 50 sec p.i.\\nAcute pancreatitis:\\nImaging in acute pancreatitis is best done after 72 hours of presentation. read more... Ct performed in the first two days can underestimate the severity of the disease. Necrosis ca\\nn be best detected in the late arterial phase at 35 sec p.i. CT examination of the pancreas should always be done with maximum amount of contrast at a maximum flow rate, because bot\\nh small pancreatic carcinomas aswell as pancreatic necrosis in pancreatitis are difficult to detect. It is a matter of personal flavor to do the whole abdomen at 35 sec p.i. or at 7\\n0 sec p.i. Some perform one single CT somewhere inbetween 35 and 70 sec, but that is not what we prefer.\\nIleus:\\nEspecially in small bowel obstruction (SBO) you need to answer the most important question: is there strangulation? To answer that question, you need a contrast enhanced CT for the \\nfollowing reasons: Do not use positive oral contrast, because this will obscure bowel wall enhancement. The coronal reconstruction nicely shows bowel wall enhancement in a patient w\\nith ileus due to a small bowel obstruction. Notice the cluster of thick walled loops with poor enhancement and edema of the mesentery (red circle). This is a closed loop obstruction\\n with strangulation. This patient needs immediate surgery. If this patient would have been given positive oral contrast, you probably would not have notice the ischemic bowel. Read \\nmore about closed loop obstruction.\\nAnastomosis leakage:\\nLeakage after bowel surgery is a great clinical problem. Patients, who are suspected of leakage, need the best CT-protocol they can get and you as a radiologist need the best images\\n to convince the clinician. You do not want to tell the surgeon that there is probably leakage, but you are not sure. A NECT without any oral or rectal contrast is needed to compare\\n with the CECT with rectal contrast, because you don't want to end up in a discussion whether some hyperdense stuff outside the bowel is leakage or some post-operative material, den\\nse bowel content or contrast from an earlier examination.

Compare the NECT without oral or rectal contrast on the left with the images on the right after rectal contrast. There is no doubt, that contrast in \\nthe fluid collection in the right lower abdomen is the result of leakage from the bowel (arrow).\\nPulmonary emboli:\\nGood quality CT scanning is the most important factor for the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli. On a poor quality scan it is impossible to rule out emboli. We prefer to scan from botto\\nm to top, because if a patient can't hold his breath, then you will have less breathing artefacts in the lower lobes, where most of the emboli are located. In the upper lobes breath\\ning does not cause that much movement as in the lower parts of the lung. We ask the patient to breath in normally and hold his breath to avoid the transient interruption of contrast\\n, which will be explained in a moment. For good timing bolus tracking is needed. A ROI is placed in the pulmonary trunk. When the treshhold of 150 HU is reached, the patient is aske\\nd to breath in and scanning is started immediately. Transient Interruption of Contrast: Deep inspiration results in dilution of contrast in the right atrium by unopacified blood fro\\nm the inferior vena cava.\\nTransient interruption of contrast:\\nTIC is a flow artefact, that consists of relatively poor contrast enhancement in the pulmonary arteries, while there is good enhancement in the SVC and also in the aorta, which seem\\ns not logic at all. This vascular phenomenon occurs when the patient performs a deep inspiration just before the scan starts, resulting in increased venous return of unopacified blo\\nod from the inferior vena cava (IVC). More unopacified blood from the IVC than opacified blood from the SVC enters the right atrium resulting in poor enhancement of the pulmonary ar\\nteries. This phenomanon is especially seen in younger patients, who are capable of deep inspiration. 1. Optimal 2. Too late. 3. Transient interruption of contrast The quality of CT \\ndepends on good contrast delivery and perfect timing.

Many of these are discovered with prenatal ultrasound. Others are detected when a child has abdominal \\ncomplaints and imaging is performed. The cyst is either the cause of the complaints or an incidental finding. In this pictorial essay we will show the most common abdominal cystic m\\nasses in children. Ultrasound is often all that is needed for a diagnosis and will help the pediatrician or pediatric surgeon to make a treatment plan. In difficult cases MRI and so\\nmetimes CT can be useful.\\nSystematic Approach:\\nDifferentiate cystic from solid:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 419}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Origin of lesion Claw sign This refers to the acute angles between lesion and parenchyma that indicates that this lesion has arisen from the parenchyma. Check organsCheck liver, spl\\neen, ductus choledochus, ovaries and pancreas. Normal ovaries excludes ovarian cysts. Specific features Small cyst in the wall of a lesion suggests ovarian origin. Multilayered wall\\n suggests origin from the digestive tract, e.g. duplication cyst or Meckels diverticulum\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\nThe most common cystic lesions in the pediatric abdomen are listed in the table. Rare cysts that we will not discuss are: Large cystsIn large cysts it is often difficult to locate t\\nhe origin. A \"claw sign\", an organ draped over a cyst, can help to pinpoint its origin. Look for the abdominal organs and try to establish if they are normal. In doing so, you can e\\nasily exclude cysts of the liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas and choledochal duct. Neonatal girlsIn neonatal girls you are very likely dealing with an ovarian cyst. Ovaries in young \\ngirls are very mobile and an ovary with a cyst can even be located at the liver hilum, so do not rely on its typical pelvic location. Look at the wall of the cyst, search for small \\nfollicle cysts. Only the depiction of two normal ovaries excludes an ovarian cyst, unless the cyst is clearly arising from some other organ. BoysIn boys, large cystic lesions of und\\netermined origin are probably lymphangiomas. These can be so large that they can be confused with ascites. Look for sharp edged fluid in locations as Morrisons pouch or anterior to \\nthe liver to diagnose the fluid collection as ascites. The content of a lymphangioma is often cloudy and looks like a \"snow storm\" when the cyst is compressed, while in ascites the \\ncontent usually remains clear.\\nOvarian cysts:\\nNewborns and infantsWith the introduction of prenatal ultrasound, ovarian cysts are often detected antenatally. Ovarian cysts are divided in small (<4cm) or large cysts (>4 cm), and\\n into simple, anechoic, thin-walled cysts or complicated cysts. Complicated cysts are thick-walled, and can have debris and septa. Most thick-walled cysts are twisted ovaries. Some \\nreports state that these will regress, but most are resected. Postpubertal The majority of ovarian cysts in postpuberal girls are functional cysts. There are no strict guidelines fo\\nr the management of ovarian cysts in infants. Generally cysts >4 cm and complicated cysts are operated. Cysts 2.5 - 4 cm are followed-up with US. Cysts < 2,5 cm generally regress sp\\nontaneously over time and follow-up is not necessary.\\nOvarian torsion:\\nSuggestive features for ovarian torsion are: Here an antenatally detected cyst, confirmed after birth in a newborn girl. A cyst with a fluid-fluid level is seen. At operation a tors\\nion of the left ovary was found.\\nFollicular cyst:\\nThe majority of ovarian cysts in postpuberal girls are functional cysts. Normally several oocytes mature into follicles in a menstrual cycle. One of these becomes the dominant folli\\ncle, which ruptures and releases the oocyte. After release of the oocyte, the dominant follicle collapses, and the granulosa cells in the inner lining proliferate and swell to form \\nthe corpus luteum of menstruation. Over the course of 14 days the corpus luteum degenerates, leaving the small scarred corpus albicans.\\nRead more... So if one is thinking of a possible ovarian tumor process, do a follow-up ultrasound 2 weeks after the last menstruation day. The lesion should be involuted in case of \\na corpus luteum cyst\\nCorpus luteum cyst:\\nA corpus luteum may seal and fill with fluid or blood, forming a corpus luteum cyst. The transvaginal ultrasound images show a small complex ovarian cyst with wall vascularity on po\\nwer Doppler analysis. The characteristic circular Doppler appearance is called the \\'ring of fire\\'. Note, there is good through-transmission and no internal vascularity, consistent w\\nith a, partially involuted, corpus luteum cyst. Follow-up after one month demonstrated resorption of the mass and a normal left ovary.\\nHemorrhagic ovarian cyst:\\nWhen a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. On ultrasound an hemorrhagic ovarian cyst presents as an unilocular thin-wall\\ned cyst with fibrin-strands or low-level echoes and good through transmission. On MRI hemorrhagic cysts are bright on pre-contrast T1-FatSat, and dark on T2. There should be no inte\\nrnal vascularity on Doppler ultrasound or post-contrast internal enhancement on CT or MRI. Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts have variable wall thickness, and often some circumferential vas\\ncularity can be seen. Clinically the classic presentation is with acute pain. However HOC can also be an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient.\\nOvarian teratoma:\\nOvarian teratomas are composed of ecto-, meso-, and endoderm. They can become apparent as a large painless mass, but they can also twist, especially when the diameter is > 5 cm and \\ncause an acute abdomen. Some are incidental findings. On US a cystic mass can be seen with calcifications. Sometimes a fluid-fluid level is seen, by the separation of watery fluids \\nand fat. If the tumor contains lots of bone, hair, or calcifications, it is echogenic and sonographic diagnosis is challenging. A Rokitansky nodule refers to a solid mass attached t\\no the wall of a cyst, containing hair, bone, teeth or fat. A plain abdominal film can sometimes show teeth or bone. CT and especially MRI can provide a clear answer to the nature of\\n the lesion. On MRI some solid parts display high signal on T1, with low signal on fat suppressed sequences due to the fat content in the tumor. Most of the solid parts enhance afte\\nr Gadolineum. Pathology demonstrated a immature teratoma. The US- image shows a cystic lesion in the lower abdomen in a 3-year-old girl with colicky abdominal pain. At operation a t\\norsion of the right adnex was seen. On pathology a teratoma was demonstrated. Malignant teratoma\\nOvarian malignancy:\\nOvarian malignancies are rare. The chance of malignancy is greater in younger girls (1-8 y) than in girls (15-19 y). Here a CT-image of a 13-year-old girl presented with a lower abd\\nominal mass. It is a partly cystic, partly solid tumor with some calcifications. The solid parts are inhomogeneous. The tumor was resected and pathology showed a teratoma with malig\\nnant parts, with lymph node metastasis. A mirror artefact of the bladder can mimick a cystic ovariumtumor. When in doubt a repeat examination after emptying of the bladder will solv\\ne this problem.\\nIntestinal duplication cyst:\\nIntestinal duplication cysts are duplications of the bowel. The majority do not communicate with the bowel. They can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. The majority is\\n in the jejunum and ileum. Most are on the mesenteric side and, if resected, a bowel resection is necessary. Intestinal duplication cysts present with bleeding, intussusception, obs\\ntruction, abdominal pain. They can be found at prenatal ultrasound. In typical cases a multilayered lining is seen, identical to a bowel wall and peristalsis may be visible. If the \\ncyst was infected the layers can be sloughed off. Ultrasound is usually sufficient to make the diagnosis. Here an antenatally detected cyst in a girl. Ultrasound showed a multilayer\\ned cyst and two normal ovaries. At operation a duplication of the ileum was resected. A six-month-old girl presented with vomiting. Ultrasound demonstrated a multilayered cystic str\\nucture at the inner side of the duodenum. The cyst was partially resected, the common wall with the duodenum was left in situ. Pathologic examination showed a duplication cyst. Here\\n an unusual appearance of a duplication cyst. Ultrasound demonstrated an echogenic lesion in the left upper abdomen without a clear relationship to neighboring organs. At operation \\na tumor of the mesentery was resected. On macroscopic examination a tumor filled with a putty-like substance was seen. On microscopic examination a duplication cyst of the jejunum w\\nas found.\\nLymphangioma:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 420}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Large lymphangiomas can resemble ascites. Look for fluid anterior to the liver or in Morrisons pouch to exlude a lymphangioma. An abdominal lymphangioma consists of dilated lymphati\\nc channels, comparable to the cystic lesions in the neck. Sometimes the term omental cyst or mesenteric cyst is used. On ultrasound cystic masses are seen, which can be clear or clo\\nudy, unilocular or septated and small to very large. In very large lesions with only a few septa the differentiation from ascites is difficult. Lymphangiomas do not creep into small\\n spaces like ascites does, but they can be very soft with a plicated wall. CT will demonstrate masses with water density. Septa are less well seen than on ultrasound. After hemorrha\\nge they can even appear solid. The MRI characteristics depend on the absence or presence of bleeding or infection. Uncomplicated cysts are low on T1 and high on T2, but these signal\\ns are variable after bleeding. A one-year-old boy presented with a swollen abdomen. A huge cystic lesion was seen with ultrasound, extending from the liver into the pelvis. Some deb\\nris was visible. A T2-weigthed coronal MR better shows the extension of the lesion. At operation it was attached to the ascending colon, which was resected together with the lymphan\\ngioma. Here a two-year-old boy with bilious vomiting. Ultrasound showed a large thin-walled multicystic tumor, which appeared rather weak. At operation a lymphangioma of the mesente\\nry was resected.\\nRenal cystic masses:\\nRenal cysts:\\nContrary to adults, simple renal cysts are rare in children. Especially in young children think of a syndrome if you see renal cysts. Cysts occur in tuberous sclerosis, von Hippel-L\\nindau syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, among others. In children on dialysis the native kidneys will demonstrate cystic changes. Autosomal dominant polycystic disease and autosomal rec\\nessive infantile polycystic disease are outside the scope of this article. A very tortuous, debris filled ureter with peristalsis can be confused with bowel loops.\\nHydronephrosis:\\nA simple hydronephrosis of the kidney is easy to recognize. It can be due to a ureteropelvic junction stenosis, ureteric stenosis or vesicoureteral reflux If the hydronephrosis is h\\nuge it can be difficult to recognize as such, especially if debris is present. It can mimic a dilated bowel loop, especially if it is accompanied by a tortuous dilated ureter full o\\nf debris with peristalsis. A high frequency probe can show a thin layer of renal tissue surrounding the cystic structure. Even a hugely dilated pelvicocalyceal system can turn out t\\no be part of a well-functioning kidney. Radionuclear examination or MRU, after nephrostomy, can provide information on the remaining renal function. Here an ultrasound image of a fi\\nve-month-old boy with an antenatally detected dilated pyelocalyceal system and no visible ureter, in accordance with a ureteropelvic junction stenosis. On a sagittal image the dilat\\ned pyelocalyceal system is well seen. One-year-old boy was referred with a diagnosis of a cystic nephroblastoma. Ultrasound detected a huge cyst in the middle of the abdomen. When e\\nxamined from the left flank with a high frequency linear array probe some parenchymal tissue was visible surrounding very dilated calyces. This is compatible with an extreme hydrone\\nphrosis. At first it was thought that there were some solid parts in the cyst. But when pressure was applied with the probe this proved to be debris. MRI depicts the hydronephrosis \\nwith more overview. The cause was a pyeloureteric stenosis. The left kidney had 33% split renal function on renography. A pyelum reconstruction was successfully performed.\\nMulticystic kidney disease:\\nA kidney, which is mainly composed of cysts of different sizes, is most likely a multicystic dysplastic kidney. In multicystic dysplastic kidney there is no normal parenchyma and no\\n ureter. In approximately 25% of children with MCKD the contralateral kidney is affected by anomalies like reflux, ureteropelvic junction stenosis and positional abnormalities. The \\nmajority of MCKD will regress in size over time. Patients are followed with ultrasound to monitor the growth or involution of the MCKD and possible anomalies of the contralateral ki\\ndney. The image is of a one-month-old boy with a MCKD on prenatal ultrasound. Some tissue and several large cysts are seen. On Tc-99-DMSA scintigraphy no uptake was seen on the left\\n side. This is compatible with a MCKD. Antenatally a duplex system of the left kidney was diagnosed with hydronephrosis. A postnatal ultrasound demonstrates a large cyst in the uppe\\nr pole of the left kidney and some smaller cysts (not shown). No normal parenchyma was visible. On MCUG reflux in the lower pole system is seen, which is displaced caudally and rota\\nted due to the upper pole mass. This is probably a MCKD confined to the upper pole. MCKD can affect one pole of a duplicated pelvicocalyceal system.\\nCystic nephroma:\\nCystic nephroma consist of multiple cysts and septa and occur predominantly in young boys and older women. These children present with an abdominal mass, or the tumor is found as an\\n incidental finding during imaging. A cystic nephroma can also be merely composed of cysts and look like a lymphangioma. Especially in large tumors it can be difficult to visualize \\nthe remnants of the kidney from which the tumor stems. A seven-year-old boy was examined after passing a kidney stone. During ultrasound a multicystic tumor was detected. An excisio\\nn biopsy failed to remove the lesion. During five years follow-up it was stable. On MRI the lesion has a fuzzy demarcation and has water signal intensity on all pulse sequences. The\\n appearance is consistent with a cystic nephroma.\\nNephroblastoma:\\nhere an one and a half year old girl with a palpable tumor in the left abdomen. Ultrasound showed a large tumor composed of innumerable cysts, originating from the left kidney. On a\\n T2 weighted coronal image the cysts are well displayed. The remainder of the left kidney is at the caudal side of the tumor. On pathology a cystic partially differentiated nephrobl\\nastoma was diagnosed.\\nAbdominal abscess:\\nAbdominal abscesses can be seen after inflammation of abdominal organs, often appendicitis, and postoperatively. They are often of mixed echogenicity but can be largely cystic. The \\nimaging strategy in children relies more on ultrasound then in adults, and during drainage procedures general anesthesia is often needed.\\nMeckels diverticulum:\\nAn inflamed Meckels diverticulum is easily mistaken for an intussusception or appendicitis. A Meckels diverticulum is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, situated in the distal\\n ileum. It can contain heterotopic remnants of gastric or pancreatic tissue. It is often asymptomatic and detected incidentally during operation. Symptoms do occur, mostly in childr\\nen below the age of two. It can present with intestinal bleeding, intussusception, or volvulus with obstruction. It can even mimic appendicitis. Diagnosis can be made with technetiu\\nm 99-m pertechnetate scintigraphy, depicting the ectopic gastric mucosa. An inflamed Meckels diverticulum can be detected on ultrasound, but is easily misdiagnosed as an intussuscep\\ntion or appendiceal mass because it presents with a thickened bowel wall. Nine-year-old boy with rectal bleeding. At ultrasound a cystic structure was seen between the umbilicus and\\n the bladder, with a multilayered wall. This was diagnosed as eiither a Meckels diverticlum or a duplication cyst. At operation a Meckels diverticlum was resected. Nine-year-old boy\\n with abdominal pain. US and CT show a cystic structure with surrounding inflammation above the bladder. US demonstrated a multilayered wall. The preoperative diagnosis was a Meckel\\ns diverticulum or duplication cyst. At operation a Meckels diverticulum was resected. Six-year-old girl presenting with acute intestinal obstruction. Clinically an intussusception w\\nas suspected. Ultrasound showed a cystic lesion with a whirlpool sign, either a duplication cyst or a Meckels diverticulum. At operation a Meckels diverticulum with adhesions and a \\nvolvulus was found.\\nExtrapulmonary sequestration:\\nExtralobar pulmonary sequestrations can occur in the retroperitoneum, mostly on the left in a suprarenal position. They are usually detected on prenatal ultrasound as an echogenic m\\nass. Cystic parts are commonly present. This lesion should be in the differential diagnosis of an adrenal hemorrhage or neuroblastoma. Antenatally detected \"shrunken third kidney\". \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 421}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Postnatally a partly cystic, partly solid mass was seen in the left upper abdomen, separate from the spleen, kidney and adrenal gland. A presumptive diagnosis of a retroperitoneal s\\nequestration was made. This was confirmed on pathology.\\nCholedochal cyst:\\nThe therapy of choledochal cyst is resection, because it is a precancerous disease. Choledochal cyst is a rare anomaly. It classically presents with jaundice, a right upper abdomina\\nl mass, and abdominal pain. This triad is present in less than half of the patients. A long common channel of the choledochal and pancreatic duct is thought to predispose to a chole\\ndochal cyst. Pancreatic juices are believed to reflux into the choledochal duct, causing an erosion of its wall. The Todani classification is often used. (see diagram) Type 1 is the\\n most common, followed by type 4. Ultrasound can demonstrate these lesions. MRCP can support the diagnosis. Choledochal cyst can be complicated by stone formation. If the stone is i\\nmpacted it can cause bile duct dilatation and give the erroneous impression that type 4 is present instead of type 1. Therapy is resection, because it is a precancerous disease. Ant\\nenatally dectected cyst of the choledochal duct, confirmed on postnatal ultrasound as a Todani type 1 cyst. This was resected a few days after birth with a choledochojejunostomy and\\n a Roux en Y loop\\nHydrometrocolpos:\\nIf a vaginal septum persists the proximal vagina (colpos) and / or uterus (metros) can be dilated with fluid or blood, causing a hydrometrocolpos. It occurs in two age groups: in ne\\nonatal girls in who it is often detected prenatally, and in pubertal girls in whom menstrual blood accumulates in the vagina. It is caused by an imperforated hymen, or by a vaginal \\natresia of transverse vaginal septum. It can be associated with renal agenesis. The kidneys should always be imaged in girls with genital anomalies. Ultrasound can provide the right\\n diagnosis. Anomalies of the uterus are better seen with MRI. The differential diagnosis includes: Douglas abscess, rectal duplication, ovarian teratoma. The video shows a large clo\\nudy cyst in the lower abdomen, with a small uterus on top in a neonatal girl, consistent with a hydrocolpos.\\nAdrenal hemorrhage:\\nIn a patient with left adrenal hemorrhage the patency of the left renal vein should be determined. Adrenal hemorrhage mostly occurs at birth. It presents at first as an echogenic ma\\nss, which slowly liquefies in the course of several weeks. Pediatricians can become restless if the liquefaction is late to occur, for fear of missing a neuroblastoma. Absence of fl\\now and of calcifications favors a hemorrhage. Also decrease in size over time speaks for a hemorrhage. If an adrenal hemorrhage has occurred antenatally the baby can be born with a \\ncystic lesion, which can incidentally be detected. Sometimes a part of the adrenal gland is still visible with its characteristic multilayered texture. It can be confused with an ob\\nstructed upper pole moiety of a duplex kidney. A left sided adrenal hemorrhage is associated with left renal vein thrombosis. The left adrenal vein connects to the left renal vein, \\ncontrary to the right adrenal vein, which connects to the inferior caval vein. Like all hemorrhages an adrenal hemorrhage can be infected with formation of an abscess. Two-day-old b\\noy with delayed passage of meconium. On US an incidental finding of an cystic transformed adrenal hemorrhage, probably antenatally. Two months later the lesion is resolving. A newbo\\nrn boy presented with hematuria. Ultrasound showed a left renal vein thrombosis with a swollen kidney and absent venous flow. The left adrenal gland is enlarged and partly cystic, r\\nepresenting a left adrenal hemorrhage. One-month-old girl with fever and an adrenal haemorrhage on the left. Infection of the haemorrhage was suspected. Aspiration yielded pus and a\\n percutaneous drain was placed. The lesion resolved slowly.\\nSplenic cyst:\\nSplenic cysts can be congenital or acquired, mostly posttraumatic. Congenital cysts are also named epithelial or epidermoid cysts. Thick wall cyst can be considered as acquired, aft\\ner trauma or after infection. They can be anechoic or contain debris. In smaller cysts the diagnosis is straightforward. In large cysts it can be difficult to determine the organ of\\n origin. Multiple cysts can be seen in lymphangiomatosis. A 16-year-old girl underwent imaging for an ovarian tumor. As an incidental finding a splenic cyst with a lot of debris was\\n seen. It is stable over the last four years.\\nHematoma:\\nDuodenal hematoma can cause complete obstruction of the duodenum. Hematomas in the abdomen are generally echogenic at first presentation but in the resorption phase are often hypoec\\nhoic or anechoic and can present as a cystic mass. An adequate history will lead to the correct diagnosis.\\nDuodenal hematoma:\\nA seven-year-old boy started vomiting a few hours after a duodenoscopy with biopsy. Ultrasound demonstrated a echogenic mass in the third part of the duodenum compatible with a hema\\ntoma. After 6 weeks an anechoic lesion with some septa is seen Fifteen-year-old girl with anorexia nervosa and signs and symptoms of a mild pancreatitis. Ultrasound demonstrated an \\nechogenic cystic lesion below the pancreas against the duodenal wall. It looked like a hematoma. At further history taking it turned out that the patient inflicted self-injury.\\nTeratoma:\\nDo not mistake a mirror artefact of the bladder for a cystic teratoma!!\\nSacrococcygeal teratoma:\\nA sacrococcygeal teratoma is composed of solid tissue, cysts and calcifications. They are often detected at prenatal ultrasound and can be huge. There is a classification: Class 4 t\\numours can escape detection at birth and present later with constipation. The alpha-fetoprotein level will be elevated. Diagnosis is generally made on physical examination and will \\nbe confirmed on ultrasound. An MRI is often made to document the exact extension of the tumor, especially to depict intraspinal extension, although ultrasound can demonstrate this a\\ns well in newborns and infants. Two-year-old girl with a sacral mass. On ultrasound a cystic lesion anterior to the sacrum is seen, compatible with a class 4 sacrococcygeal teratoma\\n. It was completely resected. The intraspinal extension was visible on ultrasound, but MRI provides a better overview and a document for future comparison. A parasagittal MRI shows \\na presacral cystic mass. Newborn girl with a sacrococcygeal teratoma with external and internal solid and cystic parts, and a large intraspinal extension.\\nTeratoma of the gastric wall:\\nTeratomas can be present in other locations than the ovary or the sacrococcyx. They will consist of cystic, solid and/or calcified parts. Their sonographic appearance is often confu\\nsing, as is their organ of origin. MRI is important here. For-month-old boy with a large mass in the abdomen. Ultrasound shows a mixture of solid and cystic parts. It was separate f\\nrom the solid abdominal organs. MRI demonstrates the party cystic and partly solid mass. At operation a benign teratoma of the gastric wall was resected.\\nPancreatic pseudocyst:\\nA pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid collection with a fibrous wall. It can occur after trauma to the pancreas or after pancreatitis, which is mostly seen after asparaginase therapy, \\nespecially used in leukemia treatment. In older girls cystic tumors of the pancreas can occur. The most common is a solid pseuopapillary tumor. Sixteen-year-old girl with a cystic l\\nesion of the pancreatic tail. After excision pathologic examination showed a solid pseudopapillary tumor.\\nUrachal cyst:\\nThe urachus is a connection between the primitive bladder and the umbilical cord. If it does not obliterate several remnants are possible. The urachus can stay open, allowing urine \\nto escape through the umbilicus. The most common remnant is a diverticulum on top of the bladder. It is also possible that a part of the urachus persists as a cyst in the course of \\nthe urachus. Nine-year-old boy with right lower abdominal pain since 3 days.

In this review we will discuss: Common locations of stress fractures. Stress fractures\\nLocation:\\nA stress fracture is an overuse injury. Bone is constantly attempting to remodel and repair itself, especially when extraordinary stress is applied. When enough stress is placed on \\nthe bone, it causes an imbalance between osteoclastic and osteblastic activity and a stress fracture may appear. Muscle fatigue can also play a role in the occurrence of stress frac\\ntures. For every mile a runner runs, more than 110 tons of force must be absorbed by the legs. Bones are not made to withstand so much energy on their own and the muscles act as sho\\nck absorbers. As muscles become tired and stop absorbing, all forces are transferred to the bones. Stress fractures usually occur after a recent change in training regimen has\\ntaken place. Especially professional or recreational athletes and militairy\\nrecruits are subject to change in training intensity (increased), type of\\ntraining or training circumstances (new shoes, other training surface etc.)\\nand thus at increased risk of developing a stress fracture. However,\\nsedentary people may also develop stress fractures if suddenly an active\\nlifestyle is adopted. Insidious onset of pain and swelling over the affected region is the most important complaint, initially during the activity. With ongoing exposure, pain will \\nlast after the training, eventually causing the athlete to stop exercising. Finally pain is experienced at rest. Stress fractures are most common in the weight-bearing bones of the \\nlower extremity, especially the lower leg and the foot (Figure). Typical stress fracture of the distal shaft of the second metatarsal not seen on initial radiograph (left). Callus f\\normation is seen at 4 weeks follow up.\\nRadiography:\\nRadiographs have a sensitivity of 15-35% for detecting stress fractures on initial examinations, increasing to 30-70% at follow up due to more overt bone reaction. Therefore, radiol\\nogists should not be comforted by negative radiographs and should initiate further state of the art imaging. Radiographs are however mandatory in order to show\\novert fractures and to rule out other diseases,\\nlike infections or tumours. On the left a 42-year old female who walks long\\ndistances and has been experiencing forefoot pain for a month. On the initial radiograph no fracture is seen. After 4 weeks, a follow up radiograph clearly marks callus formation at\\n the site of the stress fracture. Stress fracture: Normal radiograph, while STIR image already shows a high signal intensity of the bone marrow On the left a 28-year old female with\\n recent onset of pain over a region of the 2nd metatarsal bone. At presentation, the radiograph was negative for fracture of the second metatarsal bone. An MRI STIR (Short TI Invers\\nion Recovery)sequence showed a high signal intensity of\\nbone marrow and the surrounding soft tissue,\\nindicating bone marrow edema as a result of a\\nstress fracture. Stress fractures radiographically show the following signs:\\nMRI:\\nMRI has surpassed bone scintigraphy as the imaging tool for stress fractures, showing equal sensitivity (100%) but a higher specificity (85%), probably by giving better anatomical d\\netail and more precisely depicting the tissues involved. Radiograph, STIR and T1WI of grade 3 stress fracture of 3rd metatarsal. STIR (short tau inversion recovery), T1-weighted (T1\\nWI) and T2-weighted images (T2WI) are used for characterization and grading. Grading is based on signs seen at MRI: On the left a 22-year old female, a professional athlete with a r\\necent onset of forefoot pain, persisting after training. At presentation MRI showed a high signal on the STIR- and a\\nlow signal on T1WI (i.e. grade 3 stress\\nfracture). Grade 4 stress fracture of the navicular bone. T1WI and CT (axial image and coronal reconstruction) On the left a 27-year old soccer player in the\\nhighest league of amateur football. He suffered from midfoot pain with a recent increase in\\ncomplaints. T1WI shows a definite fracture line in the navicular bone, indicating a grade 4 stress fracture. Corresponding CT shows a fracture line and sclerosis on the axial images\\n and coronal reconstructions.\\nFemoral neck fractures:\\nStress fracture of the femoral neck located on the compression side. There are two types of stress fractures of the femoral neck: They have a high risk of complicated healing\\ndue to tension exerted on the fracture\\nelements.\\nThese fractures are at risk for complete fracture and avascular necrosis. If conservative therapy fails, open reduction and internal fixation is recommended. On the left we see a co\\nmpression fracture of the femoral neck. The radiograph is normal, but MR depicts the fracture and bone marrow edema (i.e.grade 4). Follow-up radiographs at 1, 3 and 13 months A radi\\nograph made one month later shows evolvement to\\ncomplete fracture. Although this is a low-risk fracture, the follow-up radiographs at 3 and 13 months did show poor healing tendency.\\nFractures of Tibia and Fibula:\\nStress fracture on the medial side of the proximal tibia in a 42-year old runner.

The pain had started gradually during a 10-mile \\nrunning competition. The initial x-ray was reported as normal, but a T2-weigthed gradient echo of the knee shows bone marrow edema in the proximal tibia indicating the presence of a\\n stress fracture. In retrospect, the sclerotic line on the x-ray also indicates the stress-fracture. X-ray and CT-scan showing a fissure at the insertion of the flexor digitorum lon\\ngus muscle. Courtesy Dr Wuisman (3) On the left a 24-year old runner with pain in his lower leg since four months. Initially the pain was only present during running, but finally it\\n was present even in rest. The x-ray was initially reported as normal. A bone-scan (not shown) showed a focal increase of activity. A CT-scan was performed for further differentiati\\non and revealed a vertically oriented fissure at the insertion of the flexor digitorum longus muscle.

We will discuss: Overview\\nof current FIGO staging Introduction\\nIntroduction:\\nCervical cancer represents the fifth most common cancer type\\nin women and - together with endometrium cancer - accounts for 0,7% of all\\ncancer related deaths in the world (1,2).\\nPersistent human papilloma virus infection is the key risk\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 424}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='factor responsible for nearly all cervical cancers. \\nHIV infection is a second\\nknown risk factor, which increases the risk for cervical cancer by\\napproximately six-fold. \\nMost common types of cervical cancer are squamous cell\\ncarcinoma followed by adenocarcinoma and some rare other types such as\\nneuroendocrine tumors. Cervical cancer can be effectively prevented by vaccination\\nagainst HPV. Secondary prevention includes HPV DNA testing to screen for\\nactive infection and prompt treatment of cervical pre-cancer. \\nThe primary\\ntreatment for advanced cervical cancer (stage ≥ IB) is chemoradiotherapy (CRT)\\nfollowed by brachytherapy. \\nIn the vast majority of cases, this results in a complete\\nlocal tumor response and no further surgical intervention is needed. \\nIn the\\nminority of cases with persistent tumor after completion of CRT, addition surgical\\nresection is required. Early cases are treated with conservative surgery. The key risk factors in cervical cancer to assess on imaging are\\ntumor size, invasion into parametrium, pelvic side wall, vagina, bladder or\\nrectum,  and lymph node involvement. Like the uterus, the cervix shows distinct layers on T2W MRI. The cervical mucosa has a high signal intensity. \\nThe normal cervical stroma\\nhas a low signal with an intact outer border. \\nThe external cervical os is\\nthe opening between the cervix and vagina.\\nThe internal cervical os is the opening\\nbetween the cervix and the uterine cavity. The zonal MRI anatomy of the uterus and cervix varies with age.\\nDuring the reproductive age the different layers of the uterus and cervix are well recognizable and the muscular part of the uterine wall can be highly vascularized like in this 30-\\nyear-old woman (left image).\\nThere is an IUD in the uterine cavity, which can be recognized as a hypointense linear structure. In postmenopausal women the zonal anatomy becomes less\\nvisible and the cervical stroma, junctional zone and myometrium appear more\\nhomogeneously hypointense on T2W-images, like in this 70-year-old woman (right\\nimage). With age, the female reproductive organs gradually become\\nsmaller with a more pronounced loss in volume for the uterus compared to the\\ncervix.\\nStaging Cervical Cancer:\\nMR reporting checklist:\\nThe MRI report in cervical cancer should address the key risk\\nfactors used to stage the patient as listed in the table in order to determine\\nthe most appropriate treatment strategy. Additional factors to report, that are mainly used for\\nsurgical treatment planning: This schematic overview shows how the key risk factors that should be assessed on MRI impact the clinical tumor stage and corresponding treatment planni\\nng.\\nTumor type and size:\\nThe tumor size should be measured in the longest possible\\ndimension, which is often best visualized in the sagittal and sometimes in the\\ncoronal plane. Cervical tumors can show either an exophytic (typically in\\nyounger women), diffuse infiltrative or endocervical (typically in older women\\nand/or adenocarcinomas) growth pattern. \\nNote that in the right image where\\nthere is an endocervical mass, this mass causes obstruction of the cervical\\ncanal with widening of the uterine cavity which is filled with high signal\\nfluid  and intermediate signal blood resulting in a blood-fluid line.\\nVaginal invasion:\\nInvasion of the vaginal wall can be recognized on T2-weighted\\nMRI as the extension of relatively hyperintense soft tissue extending into the\\nvaginal wall. In case of vaginal invasion you need to establish whether\\nthis concerns the upper 2/3 (stage IIA) or lower 1/3 (stage III) of the vagina, as this impact patient management.\\nStage IIA1/IIA2 may be eligible for upfront surgery.\\nIn contrast lower vaginal involvement preclude surgery and patients are referred for chemoradiation.\\nParametrial invasion:\\nWhen the hypointense stromal ring of the cervix is intact\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 425}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='(left image), MRI can predict the absence of parametrial invasion with a high\\nnegative predictive value of more than 90%. Interruption of the hypointense stromal ring of the cervix (right\\nimage) and tumoral signal intensity or soft tissue mass extending into the\\nparametrium are signs indicative of parametrial invasion (FIGO stage IIB). Pitfall\\n- Expansion versus invasion This example shows a large tumor that expands the cervix. Note that there is no actual invasion of the parametia as the\\nhypointense stromal ring of the cervix is completely intact as indicated by the\\narrowheads.\\nPelvic sidewall invasion:\\nPelvic sidewall\\ninvasion is defined as invasion or tumor abutment within < 3 mm of the\\ninternal obturator, levator ani or piriformis muscles, or the iliac vessels,\\neither with or without obstruction of the ureter resulting in hydronephrosis (stage IIIB).\\nSacrouterine ligament invasion:\\nThis sagittal MRI shows a locally advanced cervical cancer (circle) with extensive invasion along\\nthe sacrouterine ligaments (arrows).\\nBladder and rectal invasion:\\nThe case on the\\nleft shows a cervical tumor with clear invasion of the dorsal bladder wall\\nextending into the bladder lumen. \\nThis represents stage IV disease. Pitfall\\n- Invasion versus bullous edema The image shows a cervical tumor invading the upper 1/3 of\\nthe vagina. There is a hyperintense layered appearance of the bladder\\nwall (arrows) consistent with bullous edema. There is no intermediate T2-weighted signal intensity or\\nnodularity within the bladder,  suggesting that there is no actual tumor\\ninvasion into the bladder.\\nLymph node staging:\\nThe regional lymph nodes in staging cervical cancer include all lymph nodes in the pelvis and para-aortic nodes up to the level of the renal veins.\\nIt is important to detect para-aortic lymph node metastases, as presence of these nodes requires adaptation of the radiotherapy field. Inguinal lymph nodes and para-aortic nodes abo\\nve the level of the renal veins are considered distant metastases. MRI has a\\nlimited diagnostic performance for pelvic lymph node staging. \\nIt mainly\\nrelies on nodal size as a criterion; size cut-offs vary in literature but a\\ncommonly used threshold is 1 cm. \\nReported sensitivities (±40-90%) and\\nspecificities (±80-100%) for MRI vary widely. \\nPET/CT is more accurate than MRI\\nand is used for pelvic lymph node staging, as well as for the assessment of\\npara-aortic lymph nodes and distant lymph node metastases  above the level\\nof the renal veins (3). Images\\nThere is a locally\\nadvanced cervical cancer with right-sided parametrial and pelvic sidewall\\ninvolvement.\\nThere is a 7 mm node dorsal to the right external iliac\\nvein (white arrow) which is indeterminate on MRI. \\nBased on its size it is not\\nclearly pathologic.  \\nOn corresponding\\nPET/CT the primary tumor is clearly FDG-avid, as is the small para-iliac lymph\\nnode (black arrow), thereby diagnosing it as N+.\\nMR protocol:\\nThe recommended MRI protocol is summarized in the table. Addional\\nrecommendations are as follows: Patient\\npreparation: Note that contrast-enhanced images are not required for\\ncervical cancer staging. \\nScheduling the examination according to the menstrual\\ncycle is not required.\\nSequence planning:\\nThe MR sequences are planned relative to\\nthe long axis of the cervical canal.\\nThe axial plane is perpendicular to the long axis of the cervical canal. The coronal plane is parallel to the long axis of the cervical canal.\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 426}),\n",

The distance from the tumor to the internal os measured at\\nthe stalk of the lesion is > 1cm.

We will discuss: Common types of \\npathology. MRI technique\\nMRI technique:\\nScan planes:\\nJust like in the shoulder you need to be sure to get the imaging planes correctly in a standardized way. Use the axis of the epicondyles on a axial localizer to plan the coronal sca\\nn. The sagittal images are scaned perpendicular to the coronal scan. In this way you get very persistent images and you will get used to the normal anatomy.\\nImaging sequences:\\nT1In every joint that is studied you should have at least one T1-sequence not only to look at the anatomy, but also as a back up for looking at the marrow. Ofcourse the T2-fatsat im\\nages will show marrow abnormalities, but T1 can be helpful in telling us what is really going on. T1 is certainly used in MR-arthrography. T2-fatsatT2 will show us most of the patho\\nlogy, whether it is in the bone marrow, ligaments or muscle because of the high water content. It can also be used to image cartilage. Gradient echoWith gradient echo we can use 3-D\\n thin sections to image the cartilage and the ligaments. In the MR-protocol we do T1 and T2-fatsat in all three imaging planes. Sometimes STIR is used.\\nMR-arthrography:\\nTypically the radiocapitellar joint is punctured from lateral with the patient prone and the arm flexed 90 degrees overhead (red arrow). This however can sometimes cause problems if\\n you are interested in the lateral ligaments and you inject lidocaine or contrast into these ligaments. So more recently we started to use the posterior approach into the olecranon \\nfossa (blue arrow). Diluted gadolinium is injected, i.e. 0,05cc + 10cc saline (an \"off-label\" use in the US). Indications for MR-arthrography are:\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 427}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Anatomy and Pitfalls:\\nWhen you study the anatomy of the elbow, it is good to use the inside-out approach. First study the bones and then continue with the ligaments and the tendons and then the surroundi\\nng structures.\\nTendon attachments:\\nCommon flexor tendon Attaches at the medial epicondyle Ulnar collateral ligament or UCL Starts at the undersurface of the medial epicondyle and runs down to the sublime tubercle, wh\\nich is the medial side of the coronoid process. Common extensor tendon Originates at the lateral epicondyle. Lateral collateral ligament Originates just underneath the attachment of\\n the common extensor tendon. Lateral ulnar collateral ligament This is a somewhat confusing term for a tendon that also originates just underneath the common extensor tendon. It swi\\nngs down behind the radial head and attaches at the area of the ulna that is called the supinator crest - see lateral view. Biceps tendon Attaches on the radial tuberosity. Brachial\\nis tendon Attaches on the coronoid process. Annular ligament Attaches on the volar side of the sigmoid notch of the ulna and runs around the radial head and attaches on the dorsal s\\nide of the sigmoid notch.\\nPseudodefect of the capitellum:\\nThis is a finding that you frequently see on coronal images. It looks like an osteochondral lesion, but if you look at the sagittal image you will notice that the coronal image runs\\n through the posterior non-articular portion of the capitellum. So when the elbow is fully extended, a portion of the radial head is actually behind the carticular surface of the ca\\npitellum. On a coronal view we will be looking at the radial head which is covered with cartilage and opposite to it the non-cartilage covered part of the capitellum, which frequent\\nly is somewhat irregular.\\nPseudo-loose body:\\nAnother common finding is a small piece of fat that you\\'ll see on the sagittal image, that looks like a small loose body or a cartilage defect. This can be explained if we look at t\\nhe articular surface of the olecranon. Typically the olecranon has two pieces of cartilage with a small area inbetween, that fills with fat.\\nPlica:\\nThis structure on the lateral side of the joint is sometimes seen and is a plica. It can be prominent and almost look like a meniscus. It is a normal structure, but sometimes it is \\nthickened or irregular and it may be a cause of symptoms.\\nElbow Mechanics:\\nThe elbow serves as a hinge joint when we look at the humeroulnar and radiocapitellar joint. The other joint is the proximal radioulnar joint with rotation allowing pronation and su\\npination. Many acute and chronic injuries occur as a result of throwing. During the throwing motion in the phase of late cocking to acceleration, there are tremendous valgus forces \\nthat are pulling the elbow. The valgus overload results in enormous tension on the medial side trying to pull things apart (yellow arrows), while the lateral side will be under comp\\nression (blue arrows). On the posterior side it causes shear forces along the head of the olecranon (black arrow).\\nValgus overload syndrome:\\nAll these forces make up what is called the \"valgus overload syndrome\" with very characteristic injuries to the elbow over time. Arthrosis in valgus overload syndrome Due to the val\\ngus overload there are shear forces on the posteromedial part of the humeroulnar joint. Notice the subchondral sclerosis seen on the T1W-image (red arrow). On the T2W-image there is\\n subchondral bone marrow edema and cartilage loss (yellow arrow).

On the coronal images there is a beautiful anterior bundle of the UCL, but notice that \\nthere is osteophyte formation on the medial part of the joint (red arrow). As we go further posteriorly there is a small area of low signal intensity (yellow arrow), which is an avu\\nlsion of part of the UCL. This is better appreciated on the radiograph. Continue with the axial scan. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll As we look on the axial scan, we can appreciate the huge osteophyte formation. Notice that the ulnar nerve (blue arrow) is next to these osteophytes and these patient\\ns may present with ulnar neuropathy.\\nPosterolateral Rotatory instability:\\nThere are different stages of instability of the elbow joint and the final stage is dislocation. In stage 1 there is subluxation of the ulna and there is tearing of the lateral ulna\\nr collateral ligament. In stage 2 there is more injury, where the coronoid perches the trochlea and there is more ligamentous injury. In stage 3 finally the coronoid ends up behind \\nthe humerus in a true dislocation and you may tear the ulnar collateral ligament, which results in a very unstable - floating - elbow.\\nElbow dislocation:\\nHere a lateral view of the elbow of a patient who fell on the outstretched arm. The radiograph shows joint effusion (red arrows) and a coronoid fracture (yellow arrow). Continue wit\\nh the MR-images. Now here is the MR. Study the images and then continue reading...

On physical exam there was decreased range of motion of the elbow and tenderness along the lateral aspect. First study the images, then con\\ntinue reading... What is the structure on the axial image behind the radial head? Sagittal view: The structure behind the radial head is the annular ligament. It is irregular and th\\nickened as a result of the posterior dislocation.\\nOsteochondral lesions:\\nOC lesion of capitellum:\\nOsteochondral lesion is the new name for osteochondritis dissecans or OCD. The chronic valgus overload can cause an osteochondral lesion on the lateral side of the elbow. It is the \\nresult of repetitive impaction and shear forces. The radiograph is of a 15 year old baseball player with 4 year history of elbow pain and a recent episode of locking. There is a foc\\nal lucency in the capitellum and some fragmntation. This is typical for a osteochondral lesion of the capitellum and the locking is probably the result of loose bodies. Continue wit\\nh the MR... The MR-arthrogram confirms the osteochondral lesion. There is gadolinium in between the humerus and the osteochondral lesion which indicates that it is unstable. If you \\ndon\\'t have gadolinium, look for joint fluid undercutting the fragment. There is a loose body in the posterior recess of the radiocapittelar joint. Notice also the fragmentation as s\\neen on the axial image. The osteochondral lesion of the capitellum is typically seen in throwers and gymnasts (11-15 yrs), who get a lot of wrist and elbow problems due to weight be\\naring. Here another case in a 20 year old gymnast. Again there is lucency on the radiograph. The MR-arthrogram shows some bone marrow edema on the coronal view. The sagittal T1W-ima\\nge shows subchondral bone abnormality, but not much of a fragment. There is some cartilage thinning, but not a defect. This is obviously a stable fragment and there were no loose bo\\ndies. These images are of a young baseball player, who presented with elbow pain at age 14. The T2W-fatsat image shows marrow edema and maybe there is a subchondral fracture. Obviou\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 428}),\n",

The T1W-image shows fragmentation (yellow arrow) with a loose body (red arrow). The T2W-image demonstrates that the fragment is unstable because there is high signal betw\\neen the fragment and the humerus. At arthroscopy there is depression and irregularity of the cartilage of the capitellum. First the loose bodies were taken out. Then frequently an O\\nATS-procedure is performed, which we will discuss now.\\nOATS procedure:\\nOATS stands for osteochondral autologous transfer. Pieces of cartilage and bone are taken out of some other non-weight bearing bone and tranferrred to the capitellum. In this patien\\nt the cartilage is taken from the non-weight bearing part of the knee. Then holes are drilled in the capitellum and the defects are filled with the autologous bone and cartilage. He\\nre the hole in the capitellum is filled with four pieces of bone and cartilage. The radial head is seen opposite the capitellum.\\nOC lesion of trochlea:\\nThese images are of a patient with anterior elbow pain. There was no recent injury. The clinical diagnosis was a biceps tendinitis or a bicipital bursitis. The findings on the coron\\nal MR-images are quite uncommon. If you would see this in the capitellum you would call it an osteochondral lesion of the capitellum. So this is called an osteochondral lesion of th\\ne trochlea. Notice the small cystic changes (white arrow). There is also a small cartilage defect. An osteochondral lesion of the trochlea is usually seen in younger patients, who h\\nave an immature skeleton. It is seen in the lateral trochlea like in this case due to repetitive hyperextension in an area with tenuous blood supply. It is also seen in the medial t\\nrochlea due to laxity and posteromedial abutment. Here a different patient. Notice that it is a young patient, because the physis is still open. There is a large osteochondral lesio\\nn in the lateral trochlea (yellow arrows). Notice the edema in the subchondral bone (red arrow). The cartilage is still intact.\\nUlnar Collateral Ligament:\\nThe ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is situated on the medial side and it has three components. The anterior bundle is the strongest component and is the primary restraint against v\\nalgus forces. On MR this is the most important structure. The posterior bundle attaches distally in a fan-shape on the olecranon. It forms the floor of the cubital tunnel. The trans\\nverse bundle runs from the olecranon to the olecranon, so it doesn't do much. The UCL (in yellow) originates on the undersurface of the medial epicondyle just beneath the origin of \\nthe common flexor tendon. It attaches on a small process on the medial side of the coronoid, which is called the sublime tubercle. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Always use the axial images when you study the ligaments, especially the UCL. Scroll through the images. text Here we see two consecutive coronal images of the UCL. I\\nt is normal to see some high signal in the proximal part (arrow). Notice how it firmly attaches to the sublime tubercle and compare this to the next images. text\\nUCL tear:\\nRemember that the UCL should attach very tightly on the sublime tubercle. In this case it doesn't, so even on these two images you can tell that there is a complete tear. Notice tha\\nt there is some marrow edema in the sublime tubercle. The mechanism of injury to the UCL is usually chronic tensile forces, which create microtears. This is seen in pitchers and oth\\ner overhead throwing-athletes. A tear can also occur in a fall on the outstretched hand. Most commonly there is a complete tear, but sometimes there is a partial tear which can be v\\nery hard to see. That is why in these athletes MR-arthrogram is usually performed. Study the images and then continue reading... This is a 18 year old baseball pitcher with medial e\\nlbow pain. A partial tear is seen creating a 'T-sign'. First study the coronal T2-fatsat images and then continue reading... Notice that the anterior bundle is intact and firmly att\\naches to the sublime tubercle (yellow arrow). On the next two images there is some soft tissue edema and more abnormal signal posteriorly (red arrow). So we suspect pathology of the\\n posterior bundle. Now you remember that the axial images can be helpful. So continue with the axial image. On the axial image we nicely see the anterior bundle is o.k. (red arrow).\\n There is only some edema next to it. However the posterior bundle is not o.k. This is partial tearing. We see this occasionally in throwing athletes, where the anterior bundle is i\\nntact and their elbow is not unstable. They somehow have torn their posterior bundle, which causes pain. They do not need surgery, but it still may keep them out of the game for qui\\nte a while. Now here is the last case. This is a 38 year old male who has been weight-lifting for 20 years. He complains of intermittent elbow pain and popping. Notice that the UCL \\nis abnormal with some areas of very high signal indicating a partial tear. On the lateral side there is subchondral edema and cartilage loss. This is arthrosis secondary to chronic \\ninstability due to the chronic partial tearing.\\nUCL repair:\\nUCL repair is done by placing tunnels in the medial epicondyle. They run done to the sublime tubercle and a graft is placed in between them. This radiograph is of a 26 year old prof\\nessional baseball player who had a UCL reconstruction. Notice the tunnels (arrow). This operation usually works very well. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll If you scroll through the MR-images you can see the tunnel in the medial epicondyle. Just like in an ACL-graft we can see the low signal of the graft going all the wa\\ny down. On the coronal images despite the spiky artifacts it almost looks like a normal UCL. Here we see images of a patient after repair who did not do so well. There is fragmentat\\nion of the bone and disruption of the graft. On the CT-scan it is better appreciated that there is a fracture through the tunnel.\\nLateral Collateral Ligament:\\nHere an illustration of the lateral collateral ligament complex. It consists of the radial collateral, the lateral ulnar collateral and the annular ligament. When you look for the r\\nadial collateral ligament, first try to identify the common extensor tendon, because right underneath it you will find the radial collateral ligament (yellow arrow). As you go more \\nposteriorly you will see the LUCL - the lateral ulnar collateral ligament, which sweeps behind the radial head (white arrows). The annular ligament is usually difficult to different\\niate from the RCL, but sometimes it can be identified on a sagittal MR-artrogram. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through these images. You can also enlarge them.\\nCommon Extensor Tendon:\\nThe common extensor tendon originates at the lateral epicondyle. On a T1W-images the tendon should have a low signal intensity (yellow arrow).\\nLateral Epicondylitis:\\nLateral epicondylitis is also known as the tennis elbow, although in 95% of cases it is seen in non-tennis players. It is due of chronic stress to the common extensor tendon, which \\nresults in partial tearing and tendinosis. Typically, the extensor carpi radialis brevis is the component that is involved. In more severe cases there is tearing of the LCL, which g\\nives a poor response to conservative treatment. Here a typical case. There is thickening and abnormal intrinsic signal on both T1- and T2W-images.\\nCommon Flexor Tendon:\\nThe common flexor tendon originates at the medial epicondyle. On a T1W-images the tendon should have a low signal intensity (red arrow).\\nMedial Epicondylitis:\\nThis is the counterpart of the lateral epicondylitis and also known as the golfer's elbow.

The findings are very subtle. The medial epicondyle of the affected arm is somewhat more o\\nsteopenic. In these cases we usually ask for a comparison view, because it can be very subtle. The diagnosis is a Little leaguer's elbow which results from chronic stress injury. Th\\ne lucency on the radiograph, which looks like a widened physis, is due to cartilage ingrowth in the metaphysis. Continue with the MR... On the MR the abnormality is very obvious. Th\\nere is marrow edema in the medial epicondyle and also in the adjacent bone (yellow arrow). Little Leaguer's elbow is also known as medial apophysitis and some call it epiphysiolysis\\n. By the way this could also be called a Salter-Harris type I fracture, if it was an acute traumatic event. Notice the normal ulnar collateral ligament (red arrow). In children the \\nweak link in valgus stress is not the ulnar collateral ligament but the physis. Here another case. This patient is a little bit older. The left epicondyle is already fused, but on t\\nhe right the physis is still a little bit open. Continue with the MR... On the MR there is marrow edema. Notice that there is also some edema where the ulnar collateral ligament att\\naches, so there is also some tearing of the UCL. Here some more views of a different patient.\\nBiceps tendon:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the axial images of the biceps tendon from the musculotendinous junction to the attachment on the radial tuberositas. The pathology of the distal bicep\\ns tendon is much like pathology in the achilles tendon. There can be tendinosis, partial tear and complete tear with or without retraction. Here are the ultrasound images of a 73 ye\\nar old male who experienced a sudden pain and a tearing sensation when lifting a box. There was pain with pronation and supination and tenderness anteriorly proximal to the elbow jo\\nint. No ecchymosis or palpable mass. On the sagittal image the tendon is thickened, but distally the tendon is lost. MRI examination was performed. Now look at the MR-images and try\\n to figure out if the tendon is retracted and whether there is a partial or complete tear... Well on the sagittal image it looks as if the tendon is completely thorn, but continue w\\nith the next images.\\nTear of distal biceps tendon:\\nThere is a complete tear, because if we follow the tendon all the way to the radial tuberosity, we can see that the tendon does not attach there (green arrow). There is only fluid. \\nThe reason why the tendon is not retracted is because the broad bicipital aponeurosis - also known as lacertus fibrosus - is still intact (red arrow). The distal biceps tendon not o\\nnly inserts to the radial tuberosity, but also via the lacertus fibrosus into the fascia of the flexor pronator mass on the medial side of the forearm. The distal tendon of the bice\\nps is encircled on the upper left image. When the aponeurosis is also thorn, then the tendon retracts and you get an obvious swelling in the arm caused by the contracted biceps musc\\nle. A distal biceps tendon tear is an uncommon injury. It is seen in about 5% of biceps injuries. It is the result of a sudden extension force to the arm when the elbow is flexed. A\\n proximal biceps tendon tear is more common. Usually it is the long head of the biceps that is completely torn. Here another example. On the T1W-image there is some thickening and s\\nome intermediate signal. This could be tendinosis, but always look at the T2W-images to look for a tear. In this case there is a partial tear. Here another case. On the sagittal ima\\nges we were not sure about a possible tear. Maybe there only was some tendinosis or tendinitis. The axial images demonstrate a high grade partial tear (red arrow). Always make sure \\nthat your axial scan goes all the way to the tuberosity, because is you stop too early, like in this case, then you will only see a thickened tendon and some fluid, but you are not \\nsure about a possible tear. Here an easy case, because the tendon is retracted as can be best seen on the sagittal image. So the lacertus must also have been torn.\\nRadiobicipital bursitis:\\nHere are sagittal and axial images of a patient who was referred to an orthopedic oncology surgeon for a mass near the elbow. There is a partial tear (arrow) of the biceps tendon, b\\nut the question is, what is the structure that we are looking at and what is within it. The structure is the radiobicipital bursa, so this is a bursitis. Remember that the biceps te\\nndon does not have a tendon sheaht, so tenosynovitis is not a possibility. The differential diagnosis for the low intensity structures within the bursa is: synovial chondromatosis, \\nPVNS and rice bodies. It turned out to be rice bodies. In any synovial lined joint or bursa these rice bodies can be formed as a result of chronic inflammation with synovial hypertr\\nophy. The villi will outgrow their blood supply, become necrotic and fall into the joint or bursa. They are called rice bodies because when you open up the joint, they just look lik\\ne rice. Here another case. The white arrow in the left sided image is pointing to the bursa. Notice that the biceps is intact. Next to the radiobicipital bursa (yellow arrow), also \\nan interosseous bursa (red arrow) was described by Abdalla Skaf in Radiology in the article entitled: Bicipitoradial Bursitis: MR Imaging Findings. Sometimes these masses mimic a tu\\nmor or they can cause impingement on the radial nerve when they become very large.\\nBrachialis tendon:\\nThe brachialis originates from the lower half of the front of the humerus, near the insertion of the deltoid muscle. It lies deeper than the biceps brachii, and is a synergist that \\nassists the biceps in flexing the elbow. The thick tendon inserts on the anterior surface of the coronoid process of the ulna. On a sagittal view, when you compare the brachialis te\\nndon (yellow arrows) with the biceps tendon (red arrows), notice that the brachialis is almost all muscle. It only has a very short tendon distally.\\nChronic avulsion:\\nThis image is of a 68 year old woman who injured her arm approximately 10 years previously and now presents with increasing pain in that arm. First study the radiograph and then con\\ntinue with the MR... First study these axial T1W-images and then continue reading... Radiograph The cortex of the ulna is irregular and in a 68 year old woman there was concern of u\\nnderlying bone abnormality like for instance a bone tumor. MRI The biceps tendon is indicated by the red arrow and demonstrates tendinosis and partial tearing. However when we look \\nat the insertion of the brachialis tendon on the coronoid process, there is tearing of the tendon with a lot of bone marrow edema as seen on the fat suppressed T2W-image. In fact th\\nis was a chronic type of avulsion injury with partial tearing of the tendon. The bone reaction can mimic an aggressive bone lesion. Here another chronic avulson, which was sent to t\\nhe oncologic surgeon, because there was concern about a possible juxta-cortical osteosarcoma. The MR however revealed the following: Chronic avulsive injuries are common in adolesce\\nnts, but may also be seen in older patients. The problem is that they may mimic infection or tumor.\\nNerves:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images.\\nUlnar nerve:\\nHere we see the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel. The posterior band of the ulnar collateral band forms the floor of the tunnel, while the retinaculum forms the roof. First stu\\ndy the images. This patient had ulnar nerve neuropathy. What is the cause? Cubital tunnel syndrome is a common peripheral neuropathy. It arises from compression of the ulnar nerve w\\nithin the cubital tunnel, where the nerve passes beneath the cubital tunnel retinaculum. Possible causes of cubital tunnel syndrome: Read more on neuropathy in the 2006 Radiographic\\ns article by Gustav Andreisek et al entitled: Peripheral neuropathies of the median, radial and ulnar nerves: MR imaging features.

              " Document(page_content=\"able cause... The ulnar nerve is not where it is supposed to be. Now the nerve could be dislocated, but in this case the nerve was surgically transposed. Ulnar nerve transposition i\\ns performed in patients in whom the ulnar nerve is compressed against the medial epicondyle. So the question is, when they take the ulnar nerve out of the tunnel, where do they put \\nit. This can be subcutaneous, submuscular or intramuscular. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll So when we go back to the image, you will notice that it can be difficult to find the nerve. Any of these subcutaneous structures could be the transposed nerve. A way\\n to do it, is to follow the structures distally until you find the ulnar nerve distally in its normal position in the proximal forearm surrounded by fat. Then when you follow it pro\\nximally, you will notice that this was a subcutaneous transposition. In this case, there is neuritis. There is enlargement of the nerve. On the T2W-image there is high signal. Anoth\\ner sign is non-uniform enlargement of the fascicles, which is seen on the sagittal image (arrow).\\nRadial nerve:\\nThe radial nerve can be best identified at the level of the radial head, where you can see superficial and deep branches in the radial tunnel (arrows). This is a very consistent pla\\nce to find the radial nerve. The deep radial branches form the posterior interosseus nerve which penetrates the supinator muscle at the arcade of Frohse (arrow). Study these images \\nand then continue reading. What are the findings? The findings are: So the atrophy is a result of compression of the posterior interosseous nerve, which is a branch of the radial ne\\nrve.\\nMedian nerve:\\nThe median nerve goes down behind the Lacertus fibrosis, which is the aponeurosis of the biceps and penetrates the pronator muscle.\\nDenervation:\\nNerve pathology can present as thickening of the nerve when there is neuritis or as a result of compression of the nerve. A secondary sign of nerve pathology is denervationwith edem\\na and/or atrophy of the muscle. In this case there is chronic atrophy with high sinal on T1, which is irreversible. In early or subacute denervation the prominent sign is edema with\\n high signal on T2W-images and that is reversible. This is a 48 year old male with Marfan's syndrome, who had a sudden onset of right hand weakness. This is a nice example of subacu\\nte denervation. Notice on the T1W-image that there is no atrophy. Only edema on the T2W-image. This was due to proximal radial neuropathy.\\nSoft Tissue Masses:\\nAround the elbow all kind of soft tissue masses can occur, which are also seen in other places. If you cannot make a specific diagnosis, just call the mass indeterminate an do a bio\\npsy, because in many cases you cannot tell the diagnosis. The image shows an oval lesion, which just looks like a schwannoma, because it is elongated and it looks as if it follows t\\nhe nerve, but it turned out to be a synovial sarcoma in an 11 year old boy. Only make a diagnosis when you are sure of a specific diagnosis like bursitis, AVM, lipoma, PVNS or a cys\\nt or hematoma. Cat scratch disease Here a 37 year old male who presented to the emergency department with pain, swelling and a mass at the left elbow that had been increasing over t\\nhe last 3 weeks. On MR a mass was seen just above the medial epicondyle, where the epitrochlear lymph nodes live. The mass is very heterogeneous as is the enhancement. Based on the \\nMR-findings you still have to call this mass indeterminate. The final diagnosis was cat scratch disease based on high Bartonella henselae titers. Here images of a 26 year old female\\n who also came with a mass in the peritrochlear region. It looks quite homogeneous and cystic. Continue with the post-Gd image. Notice the inhomogeneous enhancement on the MRI and p\\nrominent internal vascularity on the sagittal ultrasound image. So this was not a cystic mass. Again this was diagnosed as indeterminate. The final diagnosis at biopsy was Lymphoma.\\n Here some additional images of the nerve-sheath tumor look-a-like, which turned out to be a synovial sarcoma.\\nNeonatal Chest X-Ray:\\nJoost van Schuppen, Laura Kox, Wes Onland, Robin Smithuis and Rick van Rijn\\nRadiology, Nuclear medicine and Neonatology department of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre:\\nIn this review we will discuss a systematic approach to the neonatal chest radiograph. \\nClose collaboration between neonatologists and radiologists is the key in achieving the correct diagnosis, since the radiographic features of many lung disorders overlap and the fin\\ndings on the chest film can be rather subtle.\\nClinical information like age of the neonate, gestational age and therapy with ventilation or surfactant is vital for the interpretation of the radiological findings. We will first \\ndiscuss a diagnostic approach based on radiographic and clinical findings and subsequently we will discuss the specific pulmonary diseases and complications. Interpretations of tube\\n positions, lines and catheter positions are discussed in Tubes and lines in neonates.\\nIntroduction:\\nPreterm infants show different types of pathology compared to\\nterm infants. \\nFor example, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is almost\\nexclusively seen in preterm infants.\\nMeconium aspiration (MA) on the other\\nhand, is seen in full term or late term neonates in combination with\\nmeconium-stained amniotic fluid during labor.\\nInfants born between 34 and 37 weeks of gestation can have\\ndiseases occurring in both preterm and full-term infants. Invasive mechanical ventilation and surfactant therapy will\\nhave a huge impact on the radiographic findings and are essential clinical information\\nfor the radiologist. Here is a list of common pulmonary disorders in neonates\\nbased on acute and chronic disease, complications of ventilation and congenital\\nanomalies (Table). * CPAM was previously referred to as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) and presents as a mass of abnormal non-functional lung tissue * TAPVR is to\\ntal anomalous pulmonary venous return. The pulmonary veins do not connect to the left atrium, but enter the systemic venous circulation. The approach to the neonatal chest film star\\nts by looking at the technique of the radiograph.\\nThen the position of lines and tubes is analyzed.\\nSee Lines and tubes in Neonates.\\nAfter these steps, the chest film can be interpreted for pathology. This is done in a stepwise manner: The postnatal age of the neonate in days or hours is important as some disorde\\nrs are acute conditions and some disorders at a present later stage. In addition, the course of illness and therapy so far should be taken into account.\\nPattern Approach:\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 431}),\n",

Congenital diaphragmatic herniaThis is a birth defect of the diaphragm and can be a life threatening disease.\\nThe herniation of abdominal organs into the chest results in underdevelopment of the lung.\\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS):\\nRDS is also known as hyaline membrane disease (HMD), idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and surfactant deficiency disorder (SDD).\\nIt is a result of deficiency of surfactant due to\\nimmaturity of the lungs in preterm infants. Surfactant production starts between 24 to 28 week of gestational age. The incidence of RDS is inversely related to the gestational age a\\nt birth. It ranges from 50% in newborns at 26-28 weeks gestation and decreases to 25% in newborns at 30-31 weeks. As a result of the surfactant deficiency, the alveoli will not cont\\nain air and cause diffuse bilateral micro-atelectasis, in combination with fibrin and cellular debris due to alveolar damage, which leads to poor compliance of the lungs and prevent\\ns the newborn to expand the lungs properly. Endogenous production of surfactant will begin at approximately 36 - 72 hours regardless of the gestational age of the patient. Therefore\\n, the diagnosis of RDS is restricted to the first week of life. Imaging Imaging findings are often most\\nsevere at birth, but may peak at 12- 24 hours after birth.\\nIn many preterm neonates improvements\\nin treatment, including antenatal glucocorticoid administration, surfactant\\nreplacement therapy and better ventilatory strategies have decreased the\\nprevalence of RDS.\\nWhen prolonged\\nmechanical ventilation is necessary, this increases the risk of lung injury and air\\nleak and can evolve into chronic lung disease. 33 weeks + 5 weeks gestational age, day one.\\nFirst look at the image.\\nWhat are the findings?

Before the advent o\\nf surfactant replacement therapy, chest\\nradiographs of infants with classic BPD demonstrated coarse reticular lung\\nopacities, cystic lucencies, and markedly disordered lung aeration that\\nreflected alternating regions of alveolar septal fibrosis and hyperinflated\\nnormal lung. Nowadays after the introduction of prenatal steroids and\\npostnatal surfactant and more sophisticated ventilatory support, BPD is\\ninfrequently seen in infants with a birth weight of more than 1200 grams and\\nover 32 weeks of gestational age. However, despite these advances in neonatal care, the\\nprevalence of BPD has changed little over the last decades due to the treatment\\nand improved survival rate of even more very preterm infants. As a result of these changes, the international criteria for\\nthe diagnosis BPD were changed from 28 days postnatal age to 36 weeks postmenstrual\\nage.

The introduction of surfactant treatment and improved\\nventilatory support has significantly decreased the incidence. Rupture of terminal airways results from high pressure\\ninsufflation of collapsed lung tissue. This causes air leakage into the\\npulmonary interstitium, lymphatic system or pleural space. A specific finding on neonatal chest films is air leak\\ntracking along the bronchi termed pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE). Air within the interstitium can cause stiff and incompliant\\nlungs and diminished blood flow, leading to a reduced blood oxygenation.

The antrum is a large aircell superior and posterior to the tympanic cavity and connected to the tympanic cavity via t\\nhe aditus ad antrum. The epitympanum or attic is the upper portion of the tympanic cavity above the tympanic membrane, and contains the head of the malleus and the body of the incus\\n. The tympanic membrane, the malleus, incus and stapes transfer soundwaves to the stapes footplate, which is attached to the base of the cochlea in the oval window.\\nAxial anatomy:\\nEnable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the axial anatomy. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the axial anatomy.\\nScroll through the axial anatomy from inferior to superior:\\nAxial anatomy from inferior to superior:\\nAt the most inferior level we see the facial nerve passing inferiorly to finally reach the stylomastoid foramen (not shown in this image). The carotid artery is shown within the car\\notid canal. Also at this level is the top of the jugular bulb.\\nTympanic membrane:\\nThe manubrium of the malleus (yellow arrow) is connected to the tympanic membrane. Malleus (yellow arow). Round window (blue arrow) At this level we can see the manubrium of the mal\\nleus (yellow arow) anterior to the long process of the incus. The round window is indicated by the blue arrow. The round window dissipates the pressure generated by the fluid vibrat\\nions within the cochlea and thus serves as a release valve. Stapes (green arrow) is seen connecting to the oval window.\\nStapes:\\nThe base of the stapes rocks in and out against the oval window. The vibrations are transmitted via the endolymph to the hair cells of the organ of Corti of the cochlea.\\nCochlea:\\nWithin the cochlea the movement of the hair cells convert the sound-vibrations into nerve impulses, that travel over the cochlear nerve to the auditory cortex of the brain, which in\\nterprets the impulses as sound. . The head of the malleus is seen anterior to the head of the incus (yellow arrow).\\nTympanic segment of the facial nerve:\\nIn this image at the level of the internal auditory canal, the tympanic segment of the facial nerve is seen just medial and parallel to the wall of the epitympanum. The head of the \\nmalleus (yellow arrow) is seen anterior to the head and the short process of the incus.\\nGeniculate ganglion of the facial nerve:\\nAt this level the aditus ad antrum is seen. This is the connection between the tympanic cavity and the antrum. The labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve coming from the internal \\nauditory canal angles sharply forward, nearly at right angles to the long axis of the petrous bone, to reach the geniculate ganglion. At the ganglion the facial nerve makes a U-turn\\n (first genu of the facial nerve) to run posteriorly as the tympanic segment along the medial wall of the epitympanum.\\nAntrum:\\nThe antrum is a large aircell superior and posterior to the tympanic cavity and connected to the tympanic cavity via the aditus ad antrum. It is surrounded by smaller mastoid aircel\\nls. On this last posterior coronal image the facial nerve assumes a vertical position to exit the petrous bone through the stylomastoid foramen.

As a result most structures will be sectioned obliquely on coronal images. The followin\\ng coronal images go from anterior to posterior. First we will see the tympanic membrane with the ossicles, followed by the cochlea, antrum and semicircular canalls. Finally the most\\n posterior image will show the point where the facial nerve exits the temporal bone at the stylomastoid foramen. Scutum (yellow arrow). Head of malleus (orange arrow) is seen medial\\n to the incus (green arrow)\\nScutum:\\nThe scutum (yellow arrow) is a sharp bony spur formed by the lateral wall of the tympanic cavity and the superior wall of the external auditory canal. It is usually the first bony s\\ntructure to erode as a result of a cholesteatoma, that is formed by medial retraction of the pars flaccida of the tympanic membrane into the epitympanum. If the retraction continues\\n it will result in ossicular destruction. If the cholesteatoma passes posteriorly through the aditus ad antrum into the mastoid itself, erosion of the tegmen mastoideum, with exposu\\nre of the dura and erosion of the lateral semicircular canal with deafness and vertigo, may result. On the left the most anterior point of the facial nerve is seen (white arrow). At\\n this point the nerve makes a U-turn. It is named the genu or geniculum and represents the geniculate ganglion. The malleus is seen connected to the tympanic membrane and to the inc\\nus. Coronal reconstruction clearly demonstates that the incus (I) is positioned posterolateral to the malleolar head (H).On the axial image the short crus of the incus is seen point\\ning posterolaterally. In many illustrations you will see the incus connecting medially to the malleus, but this is not correct. On the coronal reconstruction on the left it is clear\\nly demonstated that the incus is positioned posterolaterally to the malleolar head. The long crus of the incus subsequently runs inferomedially to the stapes. Head of malleus (orang\\ne arrow) is seen medial to the Incus (green arrow) A coronal image slightly more posteriorly will show the facial nerve twice. The medial portion is the part that exits the internal\\n auditory canal and runs towards the geniculate ganglion (medial white arrow). The lateral portion is the part that courses in a posterior direction, coming from the U-turn of the f\\nirst genu.

CE-MRA detects more patent arteries than IA-DSA in patients with chronic critical ischemia and can modify the choice of therapeutic strategy in these patients \\n(2). It is important to distinguish between patients with intermittend claudication and patients with chronic critical ischemia because they need a different imaging approach. In th\\nis overview guidelines are given how to tailor the MRA-examination by optimizing the use of surface coils, k-space filling, spatial resolution and contrast delivery. *by Tim Leiner \\nDepartment of Radiology, Maastricht University Hospital, the Netherlands*\\nPeriferal Arterial Occlusive Disease:\\nPatient with intermittend claudication on the left and an isolated stenosis in the left iliac artery.\\nIntermittend claudication:\\nIntermittend claudication is a benign form of periferal arterial occlusive disease.\\nTypically these patients have 'single level' disease usually an isolated stenosis in the iliac or femoral artery. Mostly these patients are treated with risk factor management and e\\nxercise training. There is only a relative indication for invasive therapy in order to relief the symptoms ( usually PTA, sometimes surgery). Only a limited number of these patients\\n will progress to more severe disease i.e. critical ischemia. When MRA is performed in these patients perfect imaging of lower leg and feet is not the issue since no surgeon will pe\\nrform a infragenual procedure in patients with these complaints. A one-step examination from aorta to the lower leg will usually be sufficient and venous filling is usually no issue\\n. Patient with chronic critical ischemia and 'multi level' disease.\\nChronic critical ischemia:\\nIn patients with chronic critical ischemia\\nhowever, there is rest pain and/or tissue loss.\\nThey typically have 'multi level' disease with bilateral, severe stenoses or occlusions in multiple arteries and segments. In critical ischemia there is an absolute indication for i\\nnvasive therapy.\\nThe goal is wound healing and limb saving. In these patients it is the job of MRA to find patent arteries in the lower leg or feet for bypass surgery with or without PTA. The utmost\\n attempt must be made to find vessels in the lower legs and feet because if no arteries are found amputation will be unavoidable in most cases. A two-step examination is necessary. \\nFirst you have to focus on the lower leg and feet with the best spatial resolution possible. Secondly the iliac and femoral level can be imaged. Venous enhancement from the first se\\nrie will usually not be a problem at these levels.\\nHow to optimize the Imaging Protocol:\\nEquipment requirements:\\nCentric k-spacing provides the capability to acquire the optimal part of the central k-space during the arterial-phase of contrast enhancement in a short time-period. The remaining \\ntime is used for increasing spatial resolution. Venous enhancement will not be of much of a problem because if the outer k-space is filled with data this does not add much to the co\\nntrast in the image. The arterio-venous (AV) window will be enlarged allowing longer scan time. If centric k-space filling is not available use linear k-space filling (see tips and \\ntricks). Surface coils Although some advocate the use of the bodycoil for imaging all three station, surface coils will dramatically improve image quality. Especially t in the lower\\n leg and feet a surface coil is mandatory. a 3-station coil is optimal for MRA from the aorta to the feet. If not available use as many surface coils as possible. Synergy body and s\\nynergy spine coils are very helpfull,\\nSpatial resolution:\\nAs a rule of thumb you need at least 3 pixels per vessel-diameter in order to reliably differentiate between 50% stenosis. So at different stations a different spatial resolution is\\n needed (figure). Sagittal MIP of TOF-series from aorta to the level of the feet. Variation in width and angulation will result in a better coverage at the different levels.\\nPlanning the series:\\nThe CE-MRA series can be planned on a rough TOF-serie that gives you a good idea where the vessels of interest are located. Do not use the same box for every station, but adapt the \\nsize and the angulation of the boxes at iliac, femoral and crural level. Especially at the femoral level a small box usually is sufficient. This will save time and allows you to spe\\ned up going to the lower leg. Large lower box to cover the pedal arch At the crural level especially if the pedal arch has to be included a large box will be needed. The spatial res\\nolution at this level has to be high. This results in more thin slices and a longer scan time. How to beat venous enhancement in the lower leg when there is a longer scantime is exp\\nlained later. Three station CE-MRA in patient with intermittent claudication. Fast scanning was possible with SENSE.\\nContrast bolus-timing:\\nInjection protocol:\\nIn patients with intermittent claudication a one-step examination with imaging of 3 sequential stations is optimal. In patients with critical ischemia first the lower legs with the \\npedal arch included are examined. Secondly a separate contrast injection is necessary for the examination of the Aorto-Iliac and Femoral station. Depending on the speed of the MR-sy\\nstem contrast can be delivered at a higher rate.\\nTips and Tricks in MRA:\\nDedicated imaging of crural arteries and pedal arch in patient with critical ischemia.\\nHow to beat venous enhancement in lower legs:\\nProlong the arterio-venous (AV) window by venous compression. Use a midfemoral compression with a pressure cuff at 50-60 mmHg. A normal blood pressure cuff without the metal parts u\\nsually works fine. Use centric k-space filling if available. If ontrast appears in the veins, this will not add much to the contrast in the image as at that moment the periferal lin\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 439}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='es of k-space are scanned, which mostly add to he resolution in the image. In patients with critical ischemia do a biphasic examination to concentrate first on lower leg and feet.\\nCentric k-spacing not available:\\nAt the iliac level centric k-spacing is not necessary. Linear filling of k-space works good at this level and provides the advance that the sequence can be started in front of the a\\nrrival of the contrast-bolus. If centric k-spacing is not available at your MR-machine, use linear filling of k-space at all levels. At the level of the lower leg and feet the arter\\nial contrast in the images will be less optimal and the risk of venous enhancement will be greater. A 3-station coil.\\n3-station coil not available:\\nA 3-station coil is optimal for MRA from the aorta to the feet. If not available use as many surface coils as possible. Synergy body and synergy spine coils are very helpfull, Use t\\nhe best surface coil that you have for imaging the lower leg and feet and consider to do a biphasic examination.\\nProblems with breath-hold:\\nThe most important issue in MRA of the aorta and iliac arteries is that the patient manages to hold his breath. A lower resolution breath-hold scan is superior to a higher resolutio\\nn scan with breathing artifacts. Before the actual series start you need to practise the breath-hold with the patient. If adequate breath-hold is not possible than you have shorten \\nscantime by lowering the matrix-size and increasing the slice thickness at the expense of in-plane resolution.

Gilula and Ileana Chesaru\\nMallinckrodt Institute of Radiology Washington University St. Louis, Missouri, USA and the Westeinde hospital the Hague the Netherlands.:\\nPublicationdate 2005-08-23 This article is based on a presentation given by Louis Gilula and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Ileana Chesaru. First a systematic analysis of th\\ne wrist is presented to look for carpal instability and fracture dislocation. Secondly cases are presented as examples in the chapter systematic review and diagnosis.\\nWrist analysis:\\nWhen you analyse the wrist to look for possible carpal instability and fracture dislocation, you should ask yourself the following questions: Is there good positioning of the patien\\nt. This is essential to be able to make statements about improper alignment or abnormal axes of carpal bones. Is there normal alignment between the carpal bones. The carpals should \\nbe parallel when profiled. Any overlap indicates abnormal tilting, dislocation or fracture. Is there any disruption of the three carpal archs. Disruption indicates ligament tear or \\na fracture. What is the shape and axis of the carpal bones. Give special attention to lunate, scaphoid and capitate. An abnormal shape indicates abnormal tilt with or without disloc\\nation. Answering these questions will help you find clues to carpal instability, dislocation and fractures.\\nRadiography:\\nPositioning\\nPA view should be taken with the wrist and elbow at shoulder height. Only in this position, the radius and the ulna are parallel. Moving the arm down makes the radius cross the ulna\\n and become relatively shorter. So it will be impossible to make any statements on the length of the ulna (plus or minus variant)\\nLateral view is taken with the elbow adducted to the side. Shoulder, elbow and wrist are again in one plane. This positioning will make the lateral view exactly perpendicular to the\\n PA view. Extensor carpi ulnaris groove (yellow arrow) seen radial to the midportion of the ulnar styloid. PA view A correctly positioned PA view will show the extensor carpi ulnari\\ns groove radial to the midportion of the ulnar styloid. The PA and lateral view are equally important and thus should both be studied carefully. The PA view usually shows what is wr\\nong and the lateral view shows in what direction the bones move. \\nSometimes an oblique view will also be obtained, especially if you want to look at the trapezium-trapezoid joint in profile. Lateral view Only on a good positioned lateral view one \\ncan see the volar edges of respectively scaphoid, pisiform and capitate separately and lined up as shown on the left. Lunate is the semilunar bone that fits in the distal radius. Lo\\noking through that, one can see the convexity of the scaphoid. Distally from the scaphoid is the trapezium. The angular shaped bone visible dorsally is the triquetrum. The square bo\\nne that bridges the proximal and distal half of the wrist is the pisiform. Capitate is the rounded bone fitting inside the distal lunate. Distally between the metacarpals, one can m\\nake out the hook of the hamate. Same projection of ulna and ulnar styloid on PA and lateral view due to malpositioning in a patient with a perilunate fracture dislocation. Improper \\npositioning may result in the same view of the ulna on both the PA and lateral view as shown in the case on the left. Nowhere in the body you would accept two views giving you the s\\name image of a bone. Normal oblique radiograph of the wrist and schematic representation Oblique view An oblique view is not routinely performed. It is however the only view showing\\n the trapezio-trapezoidal joint.\\nJoint spaces: parallelism and symmetry:\\nThe joint spaces of the wrist have a width of 2 mm or less. Only the radiocarpal joint is slightly wider. The carpometacarpal joints are slightly narrower than the midcarpal joints.\\n The capitolunate joint is considered the baseline joint width to which other joint spaces can be compared. One should make sure to look at all of them: the radiocarpal, the proxima\\nl intercarpal, the midcarpal, the distal intercarpal and the carpometacarpal joint spaces. Study the carpal bones as pieces of a jigsaw puzzleLEFT: Schematic representation of the w\\nrist with the outlines tracing the outer margins of the bonesRIGHT: Schematic representation of the wrist with the lines tracing the carpal bones as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle Carpal\\n joints should be symmetrical. Furthermore, when viewed in profile (tangentially), the cortical margins of the bones constituting that joint should be parallel. Bone edges that are \\nnot viewed in profile do not display this parallelism, e.g. the distal portion of the scaphoid that articulates with the capitate. Studying this parallelism is easier when regarding\\n the carpal bones as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that all fit together, as opposed to tracing carpal bones by their outer cortical margins producing the outlines (figure). When one bo\\nne is not paralleling the others, that is out of place. If the rest of the bones still parallel each other, they have stayed together. PA radiograph and schematic representation of \\nthe wrist, with dislocation of the lunate The picture on the left shows abnormal overlapping of the lunate with the capitate, hamate and triquetrum. We also see the medial profile s\\nurface of the scaphoid, but nothing paralleling it. There is also abnormal widening of the radiolunate space. The other joints are nicely parallel and symmetric. This leads to the c\\nonclusion that the lunate is displaced while the other bones have stayed together.\\nCarpal arcs:\\nPA radiograph of the wrist. The three normal carpal arcs The next step is looking at the three carpal arcs: smooth curves joining the surfaces of the carpal bones as shown on the le\\nft. The first arc is a smooth curve outlining the proximal convexities of the scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum. The second arc traces the distal concave surfaces of the same bones, a\\nnd the third arc follows the main proximal curvatures of the capitate and hamate. PA radiograph of the wrist and schematic representation showing disruption of the first carpal arc \\nDistruption of carpal arcs An arc is disrupted if it cannot be traced smoothly. A break in one of the arcs indicates a fracture or the disruption of a ligament leading to a subluxat\\nion or dislocation. On the left one can note the disruption of arc I at the lunotriquetral joint. Disruption of the second carpal arc A disruption of the second carpal arc at the sc\\napholunate joint and the lunotriquetral joint is seen on the left. Although there is a gap in the first arc, it can still be traced by a smooth curve so arc I is considered intact. \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/text1.pdf', 'page': 440}),\n",

There is an abnormal step off at the capitoham\\nate joint.\\nShape of carpal bones:\\nSchematic representation of the lunate shape in different positions\\nLunate shape:\\nThe lunate has a trapezoidal shape, as the sides converge from the proximal surface to the distal surface, which are grossly parallel. If the lunate is tilted, it becomes triangular\\n in shape. Awareness of this fact prevents thinking the lunate might be dislocated based only on its appearance, that in fact changes with its position. So it may be dislocated with\\n tilting or just be tilted. LEFT: Lunate dislocation: capitate is centered over the radius and lunate is tilted out.RIGHT: Perilunate dislocation: lunate is centered over the radius\\n and capitate is tilted out dorsally.\\nLunate vs. perilunate dislocation:\\nCommon dislocations of the wrist are the lunate and perilunate dislocations. The key to differentiation between both is what is centered over the radius. If the capitate is centered\\n over the radius and the lunate is tilted out, it is a lunate dislocation. If however the lunate centers over the distal radius and the capitate is dorsal, we are dealing with a per\\nilunate dislocation (figure). LEFT: Lateral radiograph of the wrist in extention showing scaphoid elongationRIGHT: PA radiograph of the wrist in ulnar deviation showing elongation o\\nf the scaphoid\\nScaphoid shape:\\nThe scaphoid shape changes with movement of the wrist. In ulnar deviation or extension the scaphoid elongates to fill the space between the radial styloid and the base of the thumb \\n(the trapezium). LEFT: PA radiograph of the wrist in radial deviation showing foreshortening of the scaphoid: signet ring signRIGHT: Schematic representation of the wrist in flexion\\n showing tilting of the scaphoid towards the palm Both with radial deviation aswell as flexion of the wrist the space between the radial styloid and trapezium is reduced. As scaphoi\\nd fills this space it will foreshorten and tilt towards the palm. This will give scaphoid a signet ring appearance (figure).\\nAxis of the carpal bones:\\nDrawing the longitudinal axes of some of the carpal bones on a lateral radiograph and measuring the angles between them is a good method of determining the wrist bones? spatial rela\\ntionship. The three most important axes are those through the scaphoid, the lunate and the capitate, drawn on the lateral radiograph.\\nScaphoid axis:\\nThe true axis of the scaphoid is the line through the midpoints of its proximal and distal poles. Since the midpoint of the proximal pole is often difficult to appreciate, an almost\\n parallel line can be used that is traced along the most ventral points of the proximal and distal poles of the bone (figure). LEFT: Lunate axis drawn perpendicular to a line joinin\\ng the distal palmar and dorsal bordersRIGHT: Radiograph with lunate and scaphoid axis drawn.\\nLunate axis:\\nThe axis of the lunate runs through the midpoints of the convex proximal and concave distal joint surfaces and can best be drawn by finding the perpendicular to a line joining the d\\nistal palmar and dorsal borders of the bone as demonstrated on the left. **Scapholunate angle Normal: 30 - 60? Questionably abnormal: 60 - 80? Abnormal: > 80?** This indicates insta\\nbility of the wrist. LEFT: Capitate axisRIGHT: Radiograph with lunate and capitate axis drawn.\\nCapitate axis:\\nThe capitate axis joins the midportion of the proximal convexity of the third metacarpal and that of the proximal surface of the capitate. **Capitolunate angle Normal:\\nAbnormal: > 30?.**This indicates instability of the wrist. LEFT: Dorsal tilting of the lunate in DISIRIGHT: Scapholunate angle is > 80?\\nDISI or dorsiflexion instability:\\nDISI is short for dorsal intercalated segmental instability. The intercalated segment is the proximal carpal row identified by the lunate. The term 'intercalated segment' refers to \\nit being the part in between the proximal segment of the wrist consisting of the radius and the ulna and the distal segment, represented by the distal carpal row and the metacarpals\\n. So all this means is that in DISI or dorsiflexion instability the lunate is angulated dorsally. If you think lunate is tilted, measure the scapholunate angle ( 30-60?is normal, 60\\n-80?is questionably abnormal, >80? is abnormal) and the capitolunate angle ( In the figure on the left the scapholunate angle is measured: it is 105 degrees.

While most DISI is abnormal, in many cases VISI is a normal va\\nriant, especially if the wrist is very lax.\\nSystematic review and diagnosis:\\nIn the next cases we advise you to first look at the images on the left and give a full description of the radiographs. Look for symmetry, parallelism, and the shape and axis of the\\n carpal bones. Find out if there are any fractures and then try to make the diagnosis Then read the text on the right to see if you're right. PA and lateral view of the wrist Case 1\\n Systematic interpretation of the case on the left shows us the following: On the PA-view all the carpal bones parallel each other except for the lunate. The carpal arcs I and II ar\\ne disrupted at the LT and SL joints. Triangular shaped lunate So by just looking at the PA view we can make the diagnosis of lunate dislocation. Case 2 Analysis: No parallelism at t\\nhe TL joint since there is overlapping of the triquetrum and the lunate. Also overlapping of the hamate and the lunate. There is parallelism between radius, lunate, proximal pole of\\n scaphoid and proximal pole of capitate. So these bones form a unit. Also parallelism between triquetrum, hamate, distal pole of capitate, trapezium and distal pole of scaphoid. Fra\\ncture of capitate and scaphoid So these findings indicate that this is a transscaphoid, transcapitate perilunate fracture-dislocation. On the left you see the same case with a line \\nindicating the fracture-dislocation line. Same case with additional oblique and lateral view showing the dorsal dislocation. Case 3 Analysis: Fracture of scaphoid and ulnar styloid \\nprocess. Broken arcs I and II at LT joint. Some parallelism between lunate and proximal pole of scaphoid with the radius. Scaphoid is foreshortened so it is tilted and has moved tow\\nards the palm. All the other carpals show parallelism exept for lunate, the proximal pole of scaphoid and the radius. Although this probably is a perilunate dislocation, based on th\\ne PA-view alone it is very difficult to say if this is a lunate or perilunate dislocation. The triangular shape of the lunate could be the result of just tilting or dislocation with\\n tilting. Perilunate dislocation with fracture of scaphoid and ulnar styloid processThe volar tip of lunate is also broken (see circle). Same case with the lateral view also shown. \\nNow we see that there definitely is a perilunate dislocation. So the triangular shape of the lunate is the result of just tilting. On the lateral view a fracture of the volar tip of\\n lunate is seen. So this patient is at risk for recurrent dislocation. Case 4 Analysis: The case on the left shows severe arthrosis at the STT joint and CMC1 joint with subluxation.\\n Carpal arcs are normal and there is normal paralelism.The scaphoid is elongated which means it is dorsally tilted. On the lateral view we can see that the lunate is also tilted dor\\nsally. The proximal carpal row has moved as a unit, so there is no dissociation. Final diagnosis: non-dissociated DISI with arthrosis and subluxation of STT joints. Case 5\\nAnalysis: Loss of parallelism at LT joint resulting in broken arc I and II.

Attempting\\nto master this topic by simply memorizing different variants is a suboptimal\\napproach: Müllerian duct anomalies (MDAs) are not a discreet set, but a\\ncontinuous spectrum of aberrations. With a little knowledge of the underlying\\nembryology, clinical classifications of MDAs are easier to understand, and the\\nreader is better equipped to deal with the inevitable overlap in appearance\\nencountered in clinical practice. This\\narticle begins with a very brief summary of embryological Müllerian duct\\ndevelopment and then takes you through the spectrum of MDAs on the basis of the\\nEuropean (ESHRE/ESGE) consensus classification, providing more in-depth developmental\\ndetails along the way. Imaging\\nprotocols are also briefly addressed, and we provide a checklist to help with\\nreporting of MDAs.\\nEmbryology:\\nThe female reproductive tract develops from a pair of Müllerian ducts that form the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and the upper two-thirds of the vagina.\\nThe ovaries and lower third of the vagina have a different embryological origin (genital ridge and urogenital sinus, respectively). First there is formation of the paired Müllerian \\nducts, followed by fusion of the two ducts into a single uterus, cervix and upper vagina. Finally resorption of the septum will lead to a normal\\ncavum.\\nFailure of formation of the Müllerian ducts can result in an aplastic or\\nhemi-uterus.\\nFailure or incomplete fusion of the ducts can result\\nin a bicorporeal uterus. Non or incomplete septal resorption results in a\\nseptate uterus.\\nAssociated anomalies:\\nThere is a close relation between the paramesonephric ducts of Müller and the mesonephric ducts of Wolff. The latter play an important role in development of the urinary tract and t\\nhe kidneys. \\nTherefore abnormalities of the urinary tract often coexist with MDAs, in 30-50% of cases. \\nUsually urinary tract anomalies are unilateral and ipsilateral to the malformed Müllerian duct derivative. The incidence of vertebral anomalies is higher in patients with an MDA and\\n reported in up to 29% of cases.\\nClassification of Müllerian duct anomalies:\\nEuropean classification system ESHRE/ESGE. Click for larger view. The table shows the European classification system ESHRE/ESGE from 2013. Class U0 is a normal uterus Class U1 is a \\ndysmorphic shaped uterus either as a T-shaped cavum due to abnormally thick uterine walls or as a T-shaped cavum due to an abnormal outer contour (infantilis). Class U2 is the resul\\nt of failure of resorption of the septum. There is an internal indentation. The outer contour of the uterus is normal and this differentiates the septate uterus from the bicorporeal\\n uterus. Class U3 is a bicorporeal uterus with a left and right corpus as a result of failure of fusion. The outer contour is abnormal with an external cleft of the fundus. A bicorp\\noreal septate uterus has both an external cleft and a septum. Class U4 is a hemi-uterus as a result of unilateral failure of formation of the Müllerian duct. Class U5 is an aplastic\\n uterus as a result of bilateral failure of formation of the Müllerian ducts. Class U6 are unclassified cases\\nImaging:\\nHSG showing abnormal uterine cavity. Differentiation between septate and bicorporeal uterus is not possible\\nHysterosalpingography:\\nMüllerian duct anomalies are often first detected on hysterosalpingography (HSG) during the work-up of infertility. HSG has a limited role in the diagnosis of MDA's as it only gives\\n information about the uterine cavity and not about the external contour of the uterus.\\nThe next step in the diagnosis is often ultrasound or MRI. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\\nUltrasound:\\nTransabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound are often the first imaging modalities used to evaluate the internal sex organs. \\nWhen indeterminate or complex, MR imaging is used.

Management decisions are based on the interpretation of the AP and lateral X-rays. In this article we will\\n focus on detection of fractures, that may not be so obvious at first sight. Before you read this article, you need to understand the classification of ankle fractures and exorotati\\non injuries that were highlighted in Ankle - Fractures 1 and 2.\\nPosterior malleolus fractures:\\nAlmost all fractures of the posterior malleolus are part of a rotational injury resulting in a Weber B or Weber C fracture. The tertius fracture is stage 3 in Weber B and stage 4 in\\n Weber C (figure). In some cases the tertius fractures are easily seen on the x-rays, but frequently they can be difficult to detect. It is important to find these fractures, since \\na tertius fracture can be the only clue to an unstable ankle injury. Ankle - Fractures 2 - Fracture mechanism and Radiography Linear lucency indicating a fracture of the posterior m\\nalleolus When we study the radiographs of a patient with an ankle injury, we have to study the region of the posterior malleolus very carefully. In many cases there is only a small \\ngap between the fracture parts and detection depends on optimal radiography and a high level of suspicion. The images show an obvious Weber B fracture. On the AP-view the linear luc\\nency is the clue to a tertius fracture (red arrow). It results from subtle malalignment of the fracture fragment. Likewise in some cases malalignment can result in a linear density.\\n Trimalleolar Weber B fracture In this case there is a Weber B fracture with avulsion of the medial malleolus. The bright line on the AP-view indicates a large tertius fracture frag\\nment. This tertius fracture can also be seen on the lateral view, but in many cases we need all the information of both the lateral and AP-view to diagnose a tertius fracture. Here \\nmore examples of the bright line that indicates a tertius fracture. In some cases a fracture of the posterior malleolus is barely or not visible on the radiographs and can only be s\\neen on CT. First study the radiographs and then continue with the CT. By the way....there are two fractures. You can enlarge the images by clicking on them. The CT shows an avulsion\\n of the tertius at the insertion of the posterior syndesmosis (red arrows). The alignment is so perfect, that you do not see the fracture on the radiographs. Maybe the fracture is s\\neen on the AP-view as indicated by the red arrows, but this is questionable. Notice that there is also an avulsion at the tibial insertion of the anterior syndesmosis, i.e. Tillaux \\nfracture. This combination of findings implicate that the ankle is unstable. A syndesmotic screw has to be inserted. . Here we have images of an extremely difficult case. This woman\\n had a distortion of the ankle and had pain on both medial and lateral side. She was referred to the radiology department by her general practitioner. The technician made the standa\\nrd AP-, Mortise- and lateral view and showed them to the radiologist, who was a little bit puzzled. First study the images and then continue reading. The findings are: The radiologi\\nst decided first to order a CT to find out if there really was a tertius fracture. Continue with the CT and be amazed. Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Scroll through the images. It is amazing, that such a large tertius fragment is so difficult to see on the radiographs. Also notice the soft tissue swelling on the me\\ndial side indicating rupture of the medial collateral ligaments (arrow). Do you have an idea what kind of injury this is? Medial soft tissue swelling and a tertius fracture are both\\n indications of a Weber C or Pronation Exorotation injury. Since there is no fibula fracture seen on the x-rays of the ankle, there must be a high fibular fracture. At physical exam\\n there was some swelling on the medial side and although the patient did not complain of any pain higher in the lower leg, there was some tenderness when the fibula was palpated. Th\\nis spot was marked and a fracture was found. This case illustrates the importance of medial soft tissue swelling aswell as the finding of a tertius fracture. According to Lauge Hans\\nen we can conclude that this patient first had a rupture of the medial collateral ligaments (stage 1), followed by a rupture of the anterior syndesmosis (stage 2) and a high fibula \\nfracture (stage 3) and finally an avulsion of the posterior malleolus, i.e. PE stage 4. At surgery the ankle was found to be unstable and syndesmosis screws were inserted. There was\\n an indication for fixing the posterior malleolar fracture, since the fragment involved more than 25% of the articular surface of the distal tibia. This patient had a twisted ankle \\nand the only abnormality is seen on the lateral view. This was thought to be an avulsion of the posterior malleolus. Knowing that this can be the only clue to a high Weber C, additi\\nonal radiographs were taken. Continue with the images of the lower leg. A subtle high fibula fracture is seen (arrow). Final diagnosis is a Weber C fracture or according to Lauge Ha\\nnsen: Pronation Exorotation injury stage 4.\\nIsolated Tertius fracture:\\nA fracture of the posterior malleolus as an isolated finding is very uncommon. It is seen when someone's foot hits the ground and a fragment of the posterior malleolus is pushed off\\n by the talus. The size of this fragment depends on the direction of the force (figure).\\nSalter-Harris fractures:\\nThe Salter-Harris classification describes fractures that involve the epiphyseal plate or growth plate. The most common is type II, which accounts for 75%. These Salter-Harris fract\\nures can be easily missed. In many cases there is only minimal or no displacement. The fracture through the growth plate is usually obscure and difficult to differentiate from norma\\nl variations of the growth plate.\\nAnd finally we tend not to look carefully at the epiphysis.\\nType I:\\nType I Salter-Harris fractures tend to occur in younger children (5). It is a transverse fracture through the cartilage of the growth plate or physis. Often, x-rays of a child with \\na type I growth plate fracture will appear normal. Most type I growth plate injuries are treated with a cast. Healing of type I fractures tends to be rapid and complications are rar\\ne.\\nType II:\\nA type II growth plate fracture starts across the growth plate, but the fracture then continues up through the metaphysis. This is the most common type of growth plate fracture, and\\n tends to occur in older children. Often type II growth plate fractures must be repositioned under anesthesia, but healing is usually quick and complications are uncommon.

A type III fracture also starts through the growth plate, but turns and exits through the end o\\nf the bone, and into the adjacent joint.\\nThese injuries can be concerning because the joint cartilage is disrupted by the fracture. Proper positioning is essential after a type II growth plate fracture. These injuries also\\n tend to affect older children in whom the growth plate is partially closed. Study the images and then scroll to the next images. The fracture through the epiphysis can be easily mi\\nssed (blue arrow). The fracture through the growth plate is only seen on CT.

Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Enable Scroll\\nDisable Scroll Study the images and then scroll to the next images. This is also a Salter-Harris type III fracture. Notice that there is also a Tillaux fracture. We will discuss the\\nse fractures in a moment.\\nType IV:\\nType IV is a fracture through all three elements of the bone, the growth plate, metaphysis and epiphysis. Notice that the epiphyseal fracture is in the sagittal plane, the fracture \\nthrough the growth plate is in the axial plane and the metaphyseal fracture is in the coronal plane. These fractures are also named triplane fractures. These are discussed in the ne\\nxt chapter. Proper positioning is also essential with type IV growth plate fractures, and surgery may be needed to hold the bone fragments in proper position.\\nType V:\\nType V growth plate injuries occur with the growth plate is crushed. Type V growth plate fractures carry the most concerning prognosis as bone alignment and length can be affected. \\nThese types of fractures may permanently injure the growth plate, requiring later treatment to restore alignment of the limb.\\nTriplane fracture:\\nTriplane fracture This fracture is named triplane because it occurs in the coronal, sagittal and axial plane. It is actually a Salter-Harris type IV. It is seen exclusively in young\\n adolescents in the period, when the medial tibial epiphysis is closed, while the lateral portion is still open leaving it vulnerable to injury. As the force cannot continue into th\\ne medial part of the growth plate since this is already closed, the epiphysis will fracture. As in most ankle fractures the mechanism is external rotation. The injury results in: St\\nudy the images and then continue reading. Triplane fracture At first this looks like a Weber B fracture with an oblique fracture in the fibula as seen on the lateral view (black arr\\nows). Notice however that this fracture line stops at the level of the epiphyseal plate. So this is the fracture of the metaphysis in the coronal plane. On the AP-view there is a lu\\ncency within the epiphysis, which is the epiphyseal fracture in the sagittal plane. Notice also that the medial epiphysis is already closed, while the lateral portion is still open(\\nblue arrows). We have to assume that there is an epiphysiolysis of this lateral portion. Here another example. There is only a small metaphyseal fragment, which is usually the case \\n(red arrow). The fracture through the epiphysis is indicated by the blue arrow.\\nMaisonneuve fracture:\\nIn 1840 Maisonneuve described a frature of the proximal shaft of the fibula, which was caused by exorotation force applied to the ankle. It is a high Weber C fracture. These fractur\\nes are easily overlooked because the patients rarely complain of pain in the region of the proximal fibula, since the ankle is most painful. There are three situations in which we s\\nhould suspect a high Weber C or Maisonneuve fracture: Isolated fracture of the medial malleolus According to Lauge-Hansen this is the first stage of a pronation exorotation injury, \\nwhich results in a Weber C fracture. So we have to look for higher stages. The injury can continue to the following: In all these subsequent stages, purely ligamentous injury will n\\not be visible on the radiographs of the ankle. So even in a Weber C stage 4 sometimes only a fracture of the medial malleolus will be visible. In the illustration we see the fractur\\nes and ligamentous injury on the left and the resulting x-rays on the right. Isolated fracture of the posterior malleolus Truely isolated fractures of the posterior malleolus are ve\\nry uncommon. Most fractures of the posterior malleolus are part of a complex ankle injury, either Weber B or Weber C. A Weber B fracture is easily detected because of the characteri\\nstic oblique fracture. So if there is a tertiu sfracture and no sign of a Weber B fracture, then we have to start looking for a high Weber C fracture. In that case we have the follo\\nwing combination: An isolated tertius fracture on the ankle radiographs indicates the presence of an unstable ankle injury. Any medial painful swelling or hematoma Normal radiograph\\ns do not rule out a Weber C fracture. We may have the following combination: Example 1 On the left images of a patient with a hematoma on the medial side. We can exclude a Weber A o\\nr B fracture, because we see no fracture. A high Weber C is still a possibility, i.e.\\n    + medial ligament rupture\\n    + high fibular fracture\\n    + posterior syndesmosis rupture. Additional radiographs of the lower leg were taken and demonstrated a high fibular fracture, also known as Maisonneuve fracture.\\n* Final report Weber C stage 4, i.e. medial collateral ligamentous rupture, rupture of the anterior syndesmosis, high fibular fracture and probably a rupture of the posterior syndes\\nmosis. Teaching point No fracture on the radiographs of the ankle does not exclude an unstable ankle injury This case demonstrates that there can be an unstable ankle injury that ne\\neds surgery even when the radiographs of the ankle do not show a fracture. In any patient with an ankle injury you should always ask yourself the question......can I exclude a high \\nWeber C fracture or do I need additional imaging. Example 2 There is a fracture of the posterior malleolus. Classification according to Weber is not possible. An isolated fracture o\\nf the posterior malleolus is uncommon, but as part of a supination exorotation (Weber B) or pronation exorotation injury (Weber C) it is quite common. So we have to re-examine the f\\nilms to look for signs of a Weber B or C fracture. No sign of an oblique fracture of the lateral malleolus, so we can exclude a Weber B fracture. There is still the possibility of a\\n Weber C fracture, i.e. medial rupture or avulsion, high fibular fracture and finally a posterior malleolar fracture. Now we notice the subtle avulsion of the medial malleolus (red \\narrow). Additional radiographs of the lower extremity demonstrate a high fibular fracture (blue arrow).\\n* Final report Weber C stage 4. Example 3 In this case no fracture is seen, but only soft tissue swelling on the medial side. In such a case, you have to rule out a Maisonneuve frac\\nture, which is a high Weber C fracture. Additional x-rays of the lower leg were taken. There is a high fibula fracture.\\nTillaux fracture:\\nExternal rotation injury of the ankle is the most common ankle injury and can lead to a Weber B or Weber C fracture. One of the first stages in this injury is rupture of the anterio\\nr tibiofibular ligament (or anterior syndesmosis). Less frequently it leads to an avulsion of the anterolateral tibial epiphysis. Whenever you see such a fracture, you have to look \\nfor higher stages of this exorotation injury. The x-ray shows a subtle Tillaux fracture, which is better appreciated on the CT-images. Study these images carefully and remember the \\nstages of an exorotation injury. What is going on here? There is a Tillaux fracture due to avulsion of the anterolateral part of the distal tibia by the anterior syndesmosis. This c\\nan be a stage 2 of a Weber C fracture. Stage 1 is rupture of the medial collateral ligaments and stage 3 is a fibula fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. So now we start loo\\nking for stage 4, which is rupture or avulsion of the posterior syndesmosis. Do you now see the tertius fracture on the axial CT-image?

However, in general, gliomas are often of low signal intensity on T1WI and high signal intensity on T2WI. They may also have contrast enhancement and demonstrate restricted diffusion on DWI. Radiological evaluation of gliomas involves assessment of the tissue characteristics like calcifications, fat, cystic components, and signal intensity on various sequences to differentiate them from other conditions that can simulate tumors such as abscesses, multiple sclerosis plaques, vascular malformations, aneurysms, or infarcts with luxury perfusion.
