The role of CT in this COVID-19 pandemic still has to be determined.  
CT can help to determine the severity of the disease and is a valuable and fast tool to determine whether a patient is infected by COVID-19 or not.

This can help to keep patients with a high suspicion of COVID-19 infection separate from patients with other diseases, especially when the PCR-test is false negative.

These cases are all patients that were admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 infection and all were PCR-tested.   
The findings at presentation and follow up is provided.  


In the description we use the CO-RADS classification.

The CO-RADS classification is a standardized reporting system for patients with suspected COVID-19 infection developed for a moderate to high prevalence setting.

It is a preliminary classification of likelyhood of COVID-19 infection as proposed by the COVID working group of the Dutch Radiological Society.

The interpretation of the CT findings has to be combined with the clinical symptoms and the duration of the symptoms as a CT can be negative in the first few days of a mild infection.  
However most patients that we see have complaints for a week or more.

At the moment most patients that are admitted to the hospital either have a CORADS 5, which means that they have a COVID-19 infection or they have a CORADS 1 or 2, which means no COVID-19 infection.

### 14 Subpleural bands


**History**  
75 year old male with fever for 6 days

**CT findings**Bilateral subpleural bands

**CORADS 5**

**Comment**  
Subpleural bands are probably fibrous bands but this is still not certain.  
Pan reported 17% COVID-19 patients with fibrous stripes in their study (2).   
Fibrous lesions may form during the healing of pulmonary chronic inflammation or proliferative diseases, with gradual replacement of cellular components by scar tissue.   
The relation between fibrosis and patients’ prognosis is debatable.
