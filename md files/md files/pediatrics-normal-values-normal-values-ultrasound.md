![](/img/containers/main/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a310e76cdbce_adrenal-figure.jpg/c7dc86912a080718aa395a874a95a203.jpg)




Sagittal measurement of the adrenal gland.

Causes of enlargement of adrenal glands:

* Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
* Adrenal Hemorrhage
* Adrenal Neuroblastoma








![](/assets/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a311158ab94b_adrenal-tek.png)




The length (L) of the gland is defined as the maximum cephalocaudal dimension (either coronal or sagital plane).

The width is defined as the maximum thickness of one of the limbs.







Appendix
--------





![Adapted from reference 14](/assets/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a30fef5087db_15appendix.png)

*Adapted from reference 14*




*Materials and method*


In this ultrasonographic study 146 consecutive patients (62 boys and 84 girls; mean age, 7 years; age range, 2-15 years) were included.

Children with cystic fibrosis, acute abdominal pain, with previous appendectomy and below the age of 2 years (because of difficulty in performing the examination) were excluded.

In 120 children the appendix was visualized.








![](/img/containers/main/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a30ff86c51fc_appendix-figure.jpg/7b087530fafd945d9eb21a4c48c2ecf3.jpg)

Bladder
-------





![Adapted from reference 17](/assets/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a3104d2285e7_10-bladder-capacity.png)

*Adapted from reference 17*



### Bladder volume


*Material and method*A total of 3376 children were recruited in this ultrasonographic study.

The total number of patients does not add up to the total number of patients in this study because not all age-subgroups were included in the table.








![](/assets/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a31051b2b3f4_Bladder-volume-figure.jpg)




The bladder volume was calculated first by measuring the maximum length (L) of the urinary bladder on the longitudinal scan, which was obtained from the neck to the fundus of the bladder.  

Depth (D) was measured, perpendicular to the first plane at the level of the maximum area, in the midline from the anterior to posterior mucosal surface of the bladder.  

The width (W) was taken perpendicular to D at its mid-point.  

Bladder volume as presented in the table was recalculated from the data in this study using the equation for an ellipsoïd: L×D×W (in centimetres) x 0.523.








![Adapted from reference 17](/assets/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a7d9883989f5_BVWI-figure2.png)

*Adapted from reference 17*



### Bladder wall thickness



*Materials and method:*


A total of 3376 children were recruited.  

Bladder wall thickness was only measured when the residual bladder volume was <10% of the original volume.

Causes of bladder wall thickening:

* cystitis
* dysfunctional voiding
* urethral valves








![](/img/containers/main/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a31092f3f745_Bladder-wall-figure.jpg/1cebdcdd36771496d038b34cc2f897d7.jpg)




The bladder wall thickness was measured from a zoomed image of the transverse plane of the voided bladder at 3 points: anterolaterally, laterally and posterolaterally (figure). The mean was taken for these three measurements.








![](/assets/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a31082700e0f_BVWI-figure.png)




The bladder wall thickness depends on the degree of filling of the bladder *and* its capacity.

Therefore the bladder wall thickness is expressed as the bladder volume wall thickness index (BVWI).







Bowel
-----

*Materials and Method*One-hundred ultrasound examinations performed in 100 healthy children aged 0–17.9 years (median 7.8 years, interquartile range 1.1–14.1 years) were included.

Reference values for the hepatic hilum portal vein peak systolic velocity, hepatic artery peak systolic velocity, and hepatic artery resistive index in children were established (reference).

Portal vein peak systolic velocity is not age-dependent, whereas hepatic artery peak systolic velocity and hepatic artery resistive index decrease when children get older.







Mesenteric lymph nodes
----------------------





![Adapted from reference 15](/assets/normal-values-ultrasound/a5a3100139e072_14nodes.png)

*Adapted from reference 15*




*Materials and method*


In this retrospective study in 61 children (36 boys and 25 girls, mean age 10.7 years, range 1.1-17.3 years) who underwent non-contrast abdominal CT examination for evaluation of suspected or known renal stones abdominal lymph node size was evaluated.

It is assumed that these CT findings can be extrapolated to ultrasonography.

Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (short axis > 5 mm) were found in 33 (54%) of the 61 children.  

The majority of the enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were found in the right lower quadrant (88%).  

Based on their findings the authors state that: using a short-axis diameter of >8 mm might be a more appropriate definition for mesenteric lymphadenopathy in children.

False-positive rate for enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with varying lymph node threshold size is seen in the table.
