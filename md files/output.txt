HRCT - Basic Interpretation:

Radiology Department of the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp and the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2006-12-24 / Update 2022-03-19 In this article a practical approach is given for the interpretation of HRCT examinations. We will discuss the following subjects: Differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases Introduction
Introduction:
Secundary lobules. The centrilobular artery (in blue: oxygen-poor blood) and the terminal bronchiole run in the center. Lymphatics and veins (in red: oxygen-rich blood) run within the interlobular septa
Anatomy of Secondary lobule:
Knowledge of the lung anatomy is essential for understanding HRCT. The interpretation of interstitial lung diseases is based on the type of involvement of the secondary lobule. The secondary lobule is the basic anatomic unit of pulmonary structure and function. It is the smallest lung unit that is surrounded by connective tissue septa. It measures about 1-2 cm and is made up of 5-15 pulmonary acini, that contain the alveoli for gas exchange. The secondary lobule is supplied by a small bronchiole or terminal bronchiole in the center, which is parallelled by the centrilobular artery. The pulmonary veins and lymphatics run in the periphery of the lobule within the interlobular septa. Under normal conditions only a few of these very thin septa can be seen. There are two lymphatic systems: a central network, that runs along the bronchovascular bundle towards the centre of the lobule and a peripheral network, that is located within the interlobular septa and along the pleural linings. Centrilobular area in blue and perilymphatic area in yellow. Centrilobular area is the central part of the secundary lobule. It is usually the site of diseases, that enter the lung through the airways ( i.e. hypersensitivity pneumonitis, respiratory bronchiolitis, centrilobular emphysema ). Perilymphatic area is the peripheral part of the secundary lobule. It is usually the site of diseases, that are located in the lymphatics of in the interlobular septa ( i.e. sarcoid, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary edema). These diseases are usually also located in the central network of lymphatics that surround the bronchovascular bundle.
Basic Interpretation:
A structured approach to interpretation of HRCT involves the following questions: Typical UIP with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) These morphologic findings have to be combined with the history of the patient and important clinical findings. When we study patients with HRCT, we have to realize that we are looking at a selected group of patients. Common diseases like pneumonias, pulmonary emboli, cardiogenic edema and lungcarcinoma are already ruled out. This means that uncommon diseases like Sarcoidosis, Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Lymphangitic carcinomatosis, Usual Interstitial Pneumonitis (UIP) and many others become regular HRCT diagnoses and can be real Aunt Minnies.

Reticular pattern:
In the reticular pattern there are too many lines, either as a result of thickening of the interlobular septa or as a result of fibrosis as in honeycombing.
Septal thickening:
Thickening of the lung interstitium by fluid, fibrous tissue, or infiltration by cells results in a pattern of reticular opacities due to thickening of the interlobular septa. Although thickening of the interlobular septa is relatively common in patients with interstitial lung disease, it is uncommon as a predominant finding and has a limited differential diagnosis (Table). Smooth septal thickening is usually seen in interstitial pulmonary edema (Kerley B lines on chest film); lymphangitic spread of carcinoma or lymphoma and alveolar proteinosis. Nodular or irregular septal thickening occurs in lymphangitic spread of carcinoma or lymphoma; sarcoidosis and silicosis. Focal septal thickening in lymphangitic carcinomatosis On the left we see focal irregular septal thickening in the right upper lobe in a patient with a known malignancy. This finding is typical for lymphangitic carcinomatosis. There are also additional findings, that support this diagnosis like mediastinal lymph nodes and a nodular lesion in the left lung, that probably represents a metastasis. Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis (PLC) In 50% of patients the septal thickening is focal or unilateral. This finding is helpful in distinguishing PLC from other causes of interlobular septal thickening like Sarcoidosis or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Hilar lymphadenopathy is visible in 50% and usually there is a history of malignancy. Identical findings can be seen in patients with lymphoma and in children with HIV infection, who develop Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP), a rare benign infiltrative lymphocytic disease. Septal thickening and ground-glass opacity with a gravitational distribution in a patient with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. On the left a patient who had a CT to rule out pulmonary embolism. There is a combination of smooth septal thickening and ground-glass opacity with a gravitational distribution. The diagnosis based on this CT was cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema generally results in a combination of septal thickening and ground-glass opacity. There is a tendency for hydrostatic edema to show a perihilar and gravitational distribution. Thickening of the peribronchovascular interstitium, which is called peribronchial cuffing, and fissural thickening are also common. Common additional findings are an enlarged heart and pleural fluid. Usually these patient are not imaged with HRCT as the diagnosis is readily made based on clinical and radiographic findings, but sometimes unsuspected hydrostatic pulmonary edema is found. Alveolar proteinosis On the left a patient with both septal thickening and ground glass opacity in a patchy distribution. Some lobules are affected and others are not. This combination of findings is called 'crazy paving'. Crazy paving was thought to be specific for alveolar proteinosis, but is also seen in many other diseases such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, sarcoidosis,
nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (COP), adult respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary hemorrhage. Alveolar proteinosis is a rare diffuse lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by alveolar and interstitial accumulation of a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain-positive phospholipoprotein derived from surfactant. Honeycombing in a patient with UIP
Honeycombing:
Honeycombing is defined by the presence of small cystic spaces with irregularly thickened walls composed of fibrous tissue. Honeycomb cysts often predominate in the peripheral and subpleural lung regions regardless of their cause. Subpleural honeycomb cysts typically occur in several contiguous layers. This finding can allow honeycombing to be distinguished from paraseptal emphysema in which subpleural cysts usually occur in a single layer. Honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis in UIP. The case on the left shows subpleural honeycomb cysts in several contiguous layers. There is also a lower lobe predominance and widespread traction bronchiectasis. These findings are typical for Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP). UIP or 'end-stage lung' is a pathology diagnosis and usually shown at lungbiopsy, when honeycombing is visible. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), accounts for more than 60% of the cases of UIP. UIP with lung fibrosis is also a common pattern of auto-immune disease and drug-related lung injury. A long list of drugs have been implicated, but this pattern is most commonly the result of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as bleomycin, busulfan, vincristine, methotrexate, adriamycin, and carmustine (BCNU).

The lower zone predominance is demonstrated when you scroll through the images. Notice the ground glass opacity in the left lower lobe as a result of fibrous tissue replacing the air in the alveoli.
Nodular pattern:
The distribution of nodules shown on HRCT is the most important factor in making an accurate diagnosis in the nodular pattern. In most cases small nodules can be placed into one of three categories: perilymphatic, centrilobular or random distribution. Random refers to no preference for a specific location in the secondary lobule. Perilymphatic distribution In patients with a perilymphatic distribution, nodules are seen in relation to pleural surfaces, interlobular septa and the peribronchovascular interstitium. Nodules are almost always visible in a subpleural location, particularly in relation to the fissures. Centrilobular distribution In certain diseases, nodules are limited to the centrilobular region. Unlike perilymphatic and random nodules, centrilobular nodules spare the pleural surfaces. The most peripheral nodules are centered 5-10mm from fissures or the pleural surface. Random distribution Nodules are randomly distributed relative to structures of the lung and secondary lobule. Nodules can usually be seen to involve the pleural surfaces and fissures, but lack the subpleural predominance often seen in patients with a perilymphatic distribution.
Algorithm for nodular pattern:
The algorithm to distinguish perilymphatic, random and centrilobular nodules is the following: If pleural nodules are absent or few in number, the distribution is likely centrilobular.
* If pleural nodules are visible, the pattern is either random (miliary) or perilymphatic.
* If there are pleural nodules and also nodules along the central bronchovascular interstitium and along interlobular septa, you are dealing with a periplymphatic distribution.
* If the nodules are diffuse and uniformly distributed, it is likely a random distribution.
Perilymphatic distribution:
Perilymphatic nodules are most commonly seen in sarcoidosis. They also occur in silicosis, coal-worker's pneumoconiosis and lymphangitic spread of carcinoma. Notice the overlap in differential diagnosis of perilymphatic nodules and the nodular septal thickening in the reticular pattern. Sometimes the term reticulonodular is used. Sarcoidosis On the left a typical case of perilymphatic distribution of nodules in a patient with sarcoidosis. Notice the nodules along the fissures indicating a perilymphatic distribution (red arrows). Always look carefully for these nodules in the subpleural region and along the fissures, because this finding is very specific for sarcoidosis. Typically in sarcoidosis there is an upper lobe and perihilar predominance and in this case we see the majority of nodules located along the bronchovascular bundle (yellow arrow). Sarcoidosis On the left another typical case of sarcoidosis. In addition to the perilymphatic nodules, there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes, which is also typical for sarcoidosis. In end stage sarcoidosis we will see fibrosis, which is also predominantly located in the upper lobes and perihilar. Ill defined centrilobular nodules of ground glass density in a patient with hypersensitivity pneumonitis
Centrilobular distribution:
Centrilobular nodules are seen in diseases, that enter the lung through the airways. The pathogens enter the central area of the secondary lobule via the terminal bronchiole: In many cases centrilobular nodules are of ground glass density and ill defined (figure). They are sometimes called acinair nodules.
Tree-in-bud:
In centrilobular nodules the recognition of 'tree-in-bud' is of value for narrowing the differential diagnosis. Tree-in-bud describes the appearance of an irregular and often nodular branching structure, most easily identified in the lung periphery. It represents dilated and impacted (mucus or pus-filled) centrilobular bronchioles. Tree-in-bud almost always indicates the presence of: Typical Tree-in-bud appearance in a patient with active TB. On the left a tree-in-bud is seen. In the proper clinical setting suspect active endobronchial spread of TB. In most patients with active tuberculosis, the HRCT shows evidence of bronchogenic spread of disease even before bacteriologic results are available (6). Random distribution of nodules in miliary tuberculosis
Random distribution:
On the left a patient with random nodules as a result of miliary TB. The random distribution is a result of the hematogenous spread of the infection. Small random nodules are seen in: Sarcoidosis usually has a perilymphatic distribution. However, when it is very extensive, it spreads along the lymphatics in the bronchovascular bundle to the periphery of the lung and may reach the centrilobular area. This may result in a combined perilymphatic-centrilobular pattern which can simulate the random pattern. Langerhans cell histiocytosis: early nodular stage before the typical cysts appear. Here a typical random nodular pattern in a patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is an uncommon disease characterised by multiple irregular cysts in patients with nicotine abuse. LCH in the early phase is a nodular disease (figure). These nodules eventually cavitate and become cysts. As in all smoking related diseases, there is an upper lobe predominance.
High Attenuation pattern:
Dark bronchus sign in ground glass opacity. Complete obscuration of vessels in consolidation. Increased lung attenuation is called ground-glass-opacity (GGO) if there is a hazy increase in lung opacity without obscuration of underlying vessels and is called consolidation if the increase in lung opacity obscures the vessels. In both ground glass and consolidation the increase in lung density is the result of replacement of air in the alveoli by fluid, cells or fibrosis. In GGO the density of the intrabronchial air appears darker as the air in the surrounding alveoli. This is called the dark bronchussign In consolidation, there is exclusively air left in the bronchi. This is called the air bronchogram.
Ground-glass opacity:
Ground-glass opacity (GGO) represents: So ground-glass opacification may either be the result of air space disease (filling of the alveoli) or interstitial lung disease (i.e. fibrosis). The location of the abnormalities in ground glass pattern can be helpfull: Broncho-alveolar cell carcinoma with ground-glass opacity and consolidation The ground glass pattern itself is rather unspecific. Not suprisingly, there is a big overlap in the causes of ground-glass opacity and consolidation and some diseases may present with both areas of ground-glass and consolidation. On the left we see consolidation and ground-glass opacity in a patient with persistent chest abnormalities and weight loss without signs of infection. This suggested a chronic disease. There is no honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis, so we can rule out fibrosis. The weight loss is suggestive of a malignant disease. Histology revealed broncho-alveolar cell carcinoma Broncho-alveolar cell carcinoma (BAC) may present as: LEFT: No fibrosis, so potentially treatable lung disease. RIGHT: Fibrosis, so no treatable lung disease. Treatable or not treatable? Ground-glass opacity is nonspecific, but a highly significant finding since 60-80% of patients with ground-glass opacity on HRCT have an active and potentially treatable lung disease. In the other 20-40% of the cases the lung disease is not treatable and the ground-glass pattern is the result of fibrosis. In those cases there are usually associated HRCT findings of fibrosis, such as traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing. The images show two cases with GGO, one without fibrosis and potentially treatable and the other with traction bronchiectasis indicating fibrosis. Non specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP). Notice lower lobe predominance. Here two images af a patient with GGO as the dominant pattern. In addition there is traction bronchiectasis indicating the presence of fibrosis. This case is one of the possible patterns of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). NSIP is characterized histologically by a relatively uniform pattern of cellular interstitial inflammation associated with variable degrees of fibrosis. As in UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia) it mainly involves the dependent regions of the lower lobes, but NSIP lacks the extensive fibrosis with honeycombing. NSIP may be idiopathic or associated with collagen vascular diseases or exposure to drugs or chemicals. NSIP has a relative good prognosis and the majority of patients respond to treatment with corticosteroids. This outcome is quite different from that seen in UIP, which has a poor prognosis.
Mosaic attenuation:
The term mosaic attenuation is used to describe density differences between affected and non-affected lung areas. There are patchy areas of black and white lung. The role of the radiologist is to determine which part is abnormal: the black or the white lung. When ground glass opacity presents as mosaic attenuation consider: Three different causes of mosaic attenuation It can be difficult to distinguish these three entities. There are two diagnostic hints for further differentiation: If the vesses are difficult to see in the 'black' lung as compared to the 'white' lung, than it is likely that the 'black' lung is abnormal. Then there are two possibilities: obstructive bronchiolitis or chronic pulmonary embolism. Sometimes these can be differentiated with an expiratory scan. If the vessels are the same in the 'black' lung and 'white' lung, then you are looking at a patient with infiltrative lung disease, like the one on the right with the pulmonary hemmorrhage. Temporary bronchiolitis with air trapping is seen in: Mosaic pattern in a patient with hypersensitivity pneumonitis On the left a patient with ground glass pattern in a mosaic distribution. Some lobules are involved and others are not. The differential diagnosis is hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchiolitis or thromboembolic disease. The history was typical for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis usually presents with centrilobular nodules of ground glass density (acinar nodules). When they are confluent, HRCT shows diffuse ground glass. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an allergic lung disease caused by the inhalation of antigens contained in a variety of organic dusts. Farmer's lung is the best-known HP syndrome and results from the inhalation of fungal organisms that grow in moist hay or exposure to birds as pets (1). HP usually presents in two forms either as ground glass in a mosaic distribution as in this case or as centrilobular nodules of ground glass density (acinar nodules). Mosaic pattern in a patient with chronic thromboemboli On the left a patient with ground glass pattern in a mosaic distribution. The clue here is the enlargement of pulmonary arteries (arrow) in the areas of ground glass. The ground glass appearance is the result of hyperperfused lung adjacent to oligemic lung with reduced vessel caliber due to chronic thromboembolic disease. On the left another patient with ground glass pattern in a mosaic distribution. Again the ground glass appearance is the result of hyperperfused lung with large vessels adjacent to oligemic lung with small vessels due to chronic thromboembolic disease. Emboli adherent to the wall and intravascular septa are typical for chronic thromboemboli in which partial recanalization took place. Crazy Pavin in a patient with Alveolar proteinosis.
Crazy Paving:
Crazy Paving is a combination of ground glass opacity with superimposed septal thickening (5). It was first thought to be specific for alveolar proteinosis, but later was also seen in other diseases. Crazy Pavin can also be seen in:
Consolidation:
Consolidation is synonymous with airspace disease. When you think of the causes of consolidation, think of 'what is replacing the air in the alveoli'? Is it pus, edema, blood or tumor cells (Table on the left). Even fibrosis as in UIP, NSIP and long standing sarcoidosis can replace the air in the alveoli and cause consolidation. Acute consolidation is seen in: Chronic consolidation is seen in: Most patients who are evaluated with HRCT, will have chronic consolidation, which limits the differential diagnosis. Two patients with chronic consolidations as a result of COP (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia) On the left two cases with chronic consolidation. There are patchy non-segmental consolidations in a subpleural and peripheral distribution. The differential diagnosis is the same as the list above. The final diagnosis was cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). In chronic eosinophilic pneumonia the HRCT findings will be the same, but there will be eosinophilia. In fibrosis there will be other signs of fibrosis like honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis. Bronchoalveolar carcinoma can also look like this. Organizing pneumonia (OP) Organizing pneumonia represents an inflammatory process in which the healing process is characterized by organization and cicatrization of the exudate rather than by resolution and resorption. It is also described as 'unresolved pneumonia'. If no cause can be identified it is called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). It was described in earlier years as Bronchiolitis-obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Patients with COP typically present with a several-month history of nonproductive cough. Many cases are idiopathic, but OP may also be seen in patients with pulmonary infection, drug reactions, collagen vascular disease, Wegener's granulomatosis and after toxic-fume inhalation. Chronic eosinophilic granuloma On the left a case of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. It was a patient with low-grade fever, progressive shortness of breath and an abnormal chest radiograph. There was a marked eosinophilia in the peripheral blood. Like in COP we see patchy non-segmental consolidations in a subpleural distribution. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is an idiopathic condition characterized by extensive filling of alveoli by an infiltrate consisting primarily of eosinophils. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is usually associated with an increased number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood and patients respond promptly to treatment with steroids.
Low Attenuation pattern:
The fourth pattern includes abnormalities that result in decreased lung attenuation or air-filled lesions. These include: Most diseases with a low attenuation pattern can be readily distinguished on the basis of HRCT findings. Centrilobular emphysema due to smoking. The periphery of the lung is spared (blue arrows). Centrilobular artery (yellow arrows) is seen in the center of the hypodense area.
Emphysema:
Emphysema typically presents as areas of low attenuation without visible walls as a result of parenchymal destruction. Paraseptal emphysema with small bullae Paraseptal emphysema Paraseptal emphysema is localized near fissures and pleura and is frequently associated with bullae formation (area of emphysema larger than 1 cm in diameter). Apical bullae may lead to spontaneous pneumothorax. Giant bullae occasionally cause severe compression of adjacent lung tissue. Panlobular emphysema Panlobular emphysema On the left a typical case of panlobular emphysema. There is uniform destruction of the underlying architecture of the secondary pulmonary lobules, leading to widespread areas of abnormally low attenuation. Pulmonary vessels in the affected lung appear fewer and smaller than normal. Panlobular emphysema is diffuse and is most severe in the lower lobes. In severe panlobular emphysema, the characteristic appearance of extensive lung destruction and the associated paucity of vascular markings are easily distinguishable from normal lung parenchyma. On the other hand, mild and even moderately severe panlobular emphysema can be very subtle and difficult to detect on HRCT(1).
Cystic lung disease:
Lung cysts are defined as radiolucent areas with a wall thickness of less than 4mm. Cystic lung diseases as listed in the table on the left. Cavities are defined as radiolucent areas with a wall thickness of more than 4mm and are seen in infection (TB, Staph, fungal, hydatid), septic emboli, squamous cell carcinoma and Wegener's disease. Langerhans cell histiocytosis On the left a case with multiple round and bizarre shaped cysts. There was an upper lobe predominance. The patient had a long history of smoking. This combination of findings is typical for Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an idiopathic disease characterized in its early stages by granulomatous nodules containing Langerhans histiocytes and eosinophils. In its later stages, the granulomas are replaced by fibrosis and the formation of cysts. It is an uncommon condition. The majority of patients are young or middle-aged adults presenting with nonspecific symptoms of cough and dyspnea. Up to 20% of patients present with pneumothorax and over 90% of patients are smokers. Most cysts appear round, but can also have bizarre shapes (bilobed or clover-leaf shaped). An upper lobe predominance in the size and number of cysts is common. Lymphangiomyomatosis complicated by pneumothorax On the left a case with multiple cysts that are evenly distributed througout the lung ( in contrast to LCH). Notice the pneumothorax. There was no history of smoking and this was a 40 year old female. This combination of findings is typical for Lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM). Lymphangiomyomatosis is a rare disease characterized by progressive proliferation of spindle cells, resembling smooth muscle. Proliferation of these cells along the bronchioles leads to air trapping and the development of thin-walled lung cysts. Rupture of these cysts can result in pneumothorax. Other features of LAM include adenopathy and pleural effusion. Lymphangiomyomatosis occurs only in women, usually of child-bearing age, between 17 and 50 years.
Identical clinical, radiologic, and pathologic pulmonary changes are seen in about 1% of patients with tuberous sclerosis. Most patients die within 10 years of the onset of symptoms. Bronchiectasis Bronchiectasis is defined as localized bronchial dilatation. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is usually based on a combination of the following findings: A signet-ring sign represents an axial cut of a dilated bronchus (ring) with its accompanying small artery (signet). The most common cause of bronchiectasis is prior infection, usually viral, at an early age. It also occurs in patients with chronic bronchitis, COPD and cystic fibrosis. Bronchiectasis may mimic cystic lung disease and bullous emphysema. Bronchiectasis caused by primary airway disease should be differentiated from tracion bronchiectasis as a result of fibrosis. ABPA: glove-finger shadow due to mucoid impaction in central bronchiectasis in a patient with asthma. On the left we see a chest film with a typical finger-in-glove shadow. The HRCT shows focal bronchiectasis with extensive mucoid impaction, which is in the appropriate clinical setting (asthma and serum eosinophilia) typical for Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease occurring in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis, triggered by a hypersensitivity reaction to the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus in the airways. It characteristically presents with the findings of central bronchiectasis, mucoid impaction and atelectasis.
Distribution within the lung:

Upper versus lower zone distribution:
Upper lung zone preference is mostly seen in inhalation diseases: Lower zone preference is seen in:
Central versus peripheral distribution:
Central distribution is seen in sarcoidosis, bronchitis and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Peripheral distribution is mainly seen in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and UIP.
Additional findings:

Pleural effusion:
Diseases that manifest with pleural effusion are listed in the table.
Lymphadenopathy:
In sarcoidosis the common pattern is right paratracheal and bilateral hilar adenopathy ('1-2-3-sign'). In lung carcinoma and lymphangitic carcinomatosis adenopathy is usually unilateral. Eggshell calcification
This is commonly seen in lymph nodes in patients with silicosis and coal-worker's pneumoconiosis and is sometimes seen in sarcoidosis, postirradiation Hodgkin disease, blastomycosis and scleroderma.

Ultrasound of the Breast:
Robin Smithuis, Lidy Wijers and Indra Dennert
Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp - the Netherlands:
This article provides a basic understanding of breast-ultrasound. We will focus on how mobile ultrasound can be used by health workers in regions where other modalities like mammography or MRI are not readily available. However this article is also a nice introduction for those who do mammography and MRI of the breast. The videos in the introduction cover most of the material of the article.
Introduction:

Video 1:
In this video we will discuss:
Video 2:
In this video we will discuss: Linear array transducer connected to smart phone US is mostly used in addition to mammography and MRI.
However it is an excellent primary tool to examine the breasts in symptomatic women who have a lump or localized pain in the breast. In most cases it can be decided whether we are dealing with a benign condition or breast cancer.
In some cases aspiration can help to differentiate complicated cyst from solid lesions and aspiration can be used to treat abscesses. Breast ultrasound is not usually done to screen for breast cancer. This is because it is time consuming and you may miss some early signs of cancer like small not-palpable breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ which can present as only small calcifications seen on a mammogram. That said, ultrasound is an extremely fast and powerful tool.
It is safe, cheap and mobile and modern handheld-ultrasound machines consist of only a transducer connected to a mobile phone or tablet.
These systems provide high resolution images for just over one thousand dollars. We expect that more doctors and health workers will use ultrasound in breastcare when no other modalities like mammography or MRI are affordable or available.
The connection to a mobile phone makes it easy to store images or to share them for a second opinion.
Normal Breast:
The breast consists of a mixture of fibroglandular and fatty tissue. The glandular tissue is not evenly spread in the breast.
Usually it is more pronounced in the upper lateral quadrant and it radiates from behind the nipple to more peripheral The amount of glandular tissue responds to hormonal fluctuation and shows changes during the menstrual cycle.
The amount of glandular tissue decreases with age. Focal collections of glandular tissue may present as a lump, because glandular tissue is more firm than the surrounding fatty tissue. In young women this is a very common cause of a often painful lump in the breast. When we place a transducer on the breast, the first layer that we see is the skin with underneath a mixture of glandular and fatty tissue. The deepest layer is the chest wall with the pectoral muscle, the ribs and the intercostal muscles. Posterior or deeper to the ribs no imaging is possible due to the absorption of the sound waves and this results in an artefact called posterior acoustic shadowing. This means that you cannot look beyond the ribs and that posterior to the ribs, the image is black. The normal lungs are filled with air which also reflect ultrasound waves.
The anterior border of the lung produces a hyperechoic or white line which moves as a result of normal breathing (see video below). The sound-reflection of the air-bubbles in the lungs produce what we call a dirty shadow (see next image).
This is not as pronounced as in the ribs. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Press Command + to enlarge images - Scroll for text Here we see a normal ultrasound image of the breast. The upper grey layer is the skin. Then there is a mixture of fat (dark or hypoechoic) and glandular tissue (light grey or hyperechoic). The striped layer posterior to the breast tissue is the pectoral muscle. Posterior or deeper to the ribs there is a black area or posterior shadowing. The lungs are the deepest visible layer.
The air in the lungs reflect most of the sound waves resulting in a bright or hyperechoic line with a dirty shadow posterior to it. On this video normal breast anatomy. Notice the movements of the lung during breathing. In this video a breast cancer is seen within the glandular tissue.
Breast composition:
With ultrasound we can determine the composition of the breast: homogeneous fibroglandular - heterogeneous tissue - or homogeneous fat (fig).
Notice that the mammografic and ultrasound images are very much alike. In young women the breast mostly contains glandular tissue. This glandular tissue can be very pronounced during pregnancy and lactation and can show cyclic changes in premenopausal women resulting in breasts that feel lumpy or painful. In older women the glandular tissue is gradually replaced by fat, although some older women still may have a reasonable amount of glandular tissue. In adipose women there is more fat in the breasts even in younger women. Near the midline the ribs are only composed of cartilage and are not calcified. The cartilage does not produce a white echo on the anterior side or posterior shadowing.
Instead a hypoechoic structure is seen anterior the the lungs. Do not mistake this structure for a breast tumor.
At first glance this may look like a fibroadenoma when you image the rib on cross section.
By turning the transducer you will notice that it is a long structure connected to the calcified part of the rib. The small subcutaneous lesion is a dermoid cyst, which we will discuss later. Within the same breast there may be areas with more fatty tissue and areas with mostly fibroglandular tissue as we can see on the video. When you look at the contour of the glandular tissue (arrow), you can imagine, that this can feel bumpy on palpation and sometimes give the impression of a mass, when it is very pronounced. The way that the breasts present on an ultrasound image may differ between machines of different manufacturers. This means that you have to get used to the images on your own ultrasound machine. The images are of a Philips (left) and Siemens (right) ultrasound machine. Look for instance at the difference in the presentation of the skin.
Ultrasound findings - overview:
By far the most common abnormalities in the breast, which usually present as a lump in the breast are cysts, fibroadenomas, breast cancer and palpable glandular tissue. In the table the typical ultrasound findings are listed (click to enlarge). We will discuss each of these findings in more detail in a moment. Cysts are seen in all age groups Fibro-adenomas are benign tumors which are commonly seen in young women (especially 15-25 years) and seldom as a new finding in women over 50 years. Breast-cancer is seen predominantly in women over 50 years of age and not that common in younger women. Palpable glandular tissue is seen in young women, in pregnancy and breast-feeding. 
It usually changes during the menstrual cycle.
Cyst:
Cysts are the most common lumps in the breast.
They are fluid-filled sacs inside the breast and are always benign. It is extremely important to determine the cystic nature of a palpable lump, because then you can really reassure the patient that everything is fine. On ultrasound the typical features of a cyst are: Posterior to a cyst, there is usually acoustic enhancement, also called posterior enhancement, which refers to the increased echoes deep to the cyst, because fluid transmits sound very well. When the fluid is under tension, the cyst becomes more round and can be palpable. Here a typical example of multiple cysts in a woman who felt a lump in her breast. Although there a many cysts, only the cyst in the center was palpable, because it was round with fluid under tension.
The other cysts were not palpable, because they just felt like the surrounding normal breast tissue. It is very common to find more cysts in a woman who presents with a palpable cyst. This woman had multiple small cysts in both breasts. These cysts were not palpable. Here a video of a palpable cyst. In this case the cyst was painful and it was decided to do a puncture with aspiration of the fluid. Notice that the wall is a little bit thickened.
This is frequently a sign of low grade infection and explains why the cyst was painful.
Uncomplicated cysts are usually not painful. This is another infected cyst, which was aspirated. Aspiration is a quick and simple procedure.
In most cases the fluid has a transparent yellow color, but it can be green or brown.
Examination of the aspirated fluid is not necessary.
Complicated cyst:
Most cysts have the typical appearance as shown above. Complicated cyst have an atypical appearance: A complicated cyst with a hypoechoic content usually contains low-level echoes, that move when the patient changes in position.
When there is still doubt whether a lesion is a cyst or a solid tumor, then puncture with aspiration can solve this problem. The image shows an echolucent, maybe somewhat hypoechoic lesion with some irregularity of the wall, which is thickened.
There is however posterior enhancement, which made us think, that this probably was a cyst.
A puncture was performed and the cyst was totally aspirated, which was the final proof. Enable Scroll

Intracystic tumor:
Sometimes a part of a cyst is not echolucent, but hypoechoic or hyperechoic. This can be the result of pus or debris, but it can also be an intracystic tumor like on these images.
Intracystic tumors are rare. When you see vessels with color doppler then you know it is an intracystic tumor, which can be benign or malignant.
This is a tumor with a cystic component and not a cyst. In absence of flow with color doppler and in absence of any low level echoes moving by changing patient position a puncture should be performed to differentiate between a complicated cyst and a solid mass. Pus and debris can be aspirated unlike a tumor. In this case biopsy revealed an intracystic carcinoma. Intracystic breast cancer Here another breast cancer with a cystic component. Notice the large solid component with flow on doppler image.

Scroll image for text. Here some examples of fibroadenomas. Number 1-4 are in the same patient.
This is a common finding.
When you see one fibroadenoma, you can usually find more. The lesion number 6 was biopsied because of the age of the patient and turned out to be a fibroadenoma. Lesion number 7 was biopsied because it had an irregular shape and looked like a carcinoma.
This also turned out to be a fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas sometimes have calcifications but these are larger than the small calcifications that we encounter in carcinomas. Microcalcifications as seen in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which can be a precursor of a carcinoma, are frequently not visible on ultrasound.
In the detection of DCIS mammography has advantages.
Breast cancer:
Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women.
A woman's risk of getting breast cancer increases with age. Most women diagnosed with breast cancer are over the age of 50, but younger women can also get breast cancer. The first noticeable clinical symptoms are: Here are some examples of breast cancer. The key-features are: We will now discuss the ultrasound findings in breast cancer in more detail. Enable Scroll

Hyperechoic halo:
A common finding in breast cancer is a hyperechoic halo surrounding the hypoechoic mass. This halo is part of the tumor and should be included in the measurement of the tumor. Enable Scroll

Harmonics:
Harmonic imaging is an ultrasound technique that employs the resonance characteristics of tissue. 
It is also calles tissue harmonic imaging or THI. If you have this possibility on your ultrasound machine, you will notice that images produced with harmonic imaging have a higher resolution and are associated with fewer artifacts than conventional ultrasound imaging.
Posterior shadowing can be enhanced. Notice that the small breast cancer is better seen with harmonic imaging.
There is a hypoechoic tumor with a hyperechoic halo and a little bit of posterior shadowing. The orientation is vertical.
The border is indistinct and the shape of the tumor is irregular. This is a difficult and uncommon case. When you look at the image on the left a tumor is hardly seen.
It almost looks like normal glandular tissue. However a mass was felt and when we look at the image with harmonics on, we can see the posterior shadowing. This turned out to be a breast cancer. If you have harmonics on your machine, it is best to view with and without harmonics in cases that aren't obvious to start with. Enable Scroll

Breast cancer versus Fibroadenoma:
Sometimes breast cancer can look like a fibroadenoma and fibroadenomas can look like a cancer on ultrasound. In the table the differences in ultrasound appearances are listed. The age of the patient is another important issue, since fibroadenomas are commonly seen in young women especially 15-25 years and seldom in women over 50 years, while breast cancer is most commonly diagnosed in women over the age of 50 and is not common in younger women. In some cases it is not possible to make the distinction by ultrasound imaging alone and a biopsy is needed for a final diagnosis. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Breast carcinoma versus fibroadenoma Here we have two oval-shaped hypoechoic lesions. At first glance they look not quite different.
Study the images and determine the differences. The lesion on the left is a carcinoma. The lesion on the right is a fibroadenoma. Breast cancer: at first glance looks like a fibroadenoma Age How does the age of a woman help us in the differentiation between a fibroadenoma and breast cancer? In most cases it confirms our imaging diagnosis.
On the other hand when we see a mass in the breast in a younger woman that does not full-fill all the criteria of a typical fibroadenoma, we should do a biopsy to rule out a carcinoma.
For instance because the lesion is not circumscribed or taller than wide. The same holds true for a new mass that looks like a fibroadenoma in an older woman. The image shows a lesion, that at first glance looks like a fibroadenoma. 
Yet there are two things that don't fit.
First the age of the woman is 49 years and secondly on the posterior side the contour shows some irregularities.
A biopsy was performed and the mass proved to be a cancer.
Palpable glandular tissue:
Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Fibroglandular tissue is not evenly spread in the breast and is usually more pronounced in the upper lateral quadrant. Sometimes focal swelling of glandular tissue can be very pronounced and causes a lump, that on palpation cannot be differentiated from a tumor. The ultrasound shows a collection of glandular tissue within a fatty breast.
Since the glandular tissue is more firm than the fatty tissue, this feels like a mass on palpation. A mammogram was performed with a marker on the palpable mass and also showed a focal collection of normal glandular tissue. The video is of a woman who felt a lump in her breast. On ultrasound pronounced glandular tissue was found. Since the glandular tissue is more firm than the surrounding fatty tissue, you can imagine that when you glide with your finger over the skin, this area would feel like a bump. Fibroglandular tissue can be so pronounced that it is difficult for the ultrasound beam to pass through the tissue. This may give the impression of an irregular hypoechoic mass with posterior shadowing and simulate a carcinoma (video). However when you compress the tissue, you will see that it is just hyperechoic pronounced fibroglandular tissue. Usually these are young patients who present with a large painful lump in their breast.
Abscess:
Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll A breast abscess is a painful build-up of pus in the breast caused by an infection. 
It mainly affects women who are breastfeeding as a complication of mastitis and is uncommon in non-breast feeding women. Women usually present with a painful lump and the skin can be red and thickened. The ultrasound is of a woman who presented with fever and a painful lump in the breast behind the retracted nipple.
During mild compression and decompression with the transducer it was noted that the fluid in the abscess was moving around.
Notice also the posterior enhancement which is another indication that the structure contains fluid. Continue with next image... Subsequently the abscess was apirated. Aspiration is the first choice treatment of abscesses. No need for surgery or antibiotics in this case, although antibiotics are sometimes also given. Here another abscess located behind the nipple, which was aspirated. This can be a painful procedure.
It is best to inject local anesthesia in the skin and subcutis and to try to drain the pus through that same needle. If the pus is too thick, a thicker needle will do the job.
Take some time for the local anesthesia to work.
Skin and subcutis:
Abnormalities that originate in the skin or subcutis may present as a lump in the breast, but they do not represent breast abnormalities. When you can determine that a lesion originates in the skin or subcutis, you know that you are not dealing with a breast tumor. The ultrasound images show a lesion that is located in the skin and not within the breast. Most of these lesions are dermoid cysts. 
Try to find the connection to the skin, although this is not always visible. This woman presented with a painful lump in her breast and the skin was red. This is another intradermal lesion.
Notice that the skin is thickened. This probably is a dermoid cyst with inflammation. It healed without any treatment. Enable Scroll

Lipoma:
Lipomas are not that common in the breast, but when they occur, they just look like any other lipoma in the body. They are iso- or hyperechoic compared to the surrounding fat. They are always benign. Sometimes a lipoma cannot be differentiated from fat necrosis, which we will discuss now.
Fat necrosis:
Fat necrosis is a benign entity frequently presenting as a superficially located palpable small mass within the breast. It is thought that fat necrosis is the result of trauma although the patient often does not recall a specific traumatic event. As a result of the trauma, the fatty tissue undergoes changes which make it more firm and sometimes tender on palpation. On ultrasound it usually presents as a part of the fatty tissue that is mildly swollen and hyperechoic compared to the surrounding fatty tissue.
Hence the similarity to a lipoma. The content may liquify and result in an oil cyst, which on ultrasound just looks like any other cyst. A lipoma is usually more soft and non-tender.
Ribs:

Disable Scroll This patient complained of a painful hard  swelling within her breast. On ultrasound a protruding costochondral junction was seen.
This is the part where the calcified part of the rib meets the cartilage part.
Frequently calcifications can be seen within the cartilage like in this case. This video shows normal rib cartilage. By turning the transducer you can see that the rib is a longitudinal structure anterior to the lung and posterior to the pectoral muscle..
Axilla:
Normal axillary lymph nodes are usually small oval shaped hypoechoic structures with a hyperechoic centre. The hyperechoic centre is mainly composed of fat and contains the vessels. The surrounding hypoechoic cortex is the actual lymphogenic tissue. A normal intramammary lymph node Sometimes a lymph node only presents as an oval hypoechoic lesion without a visible hyperechoic center. When you see vessels in the hilus like in this case, then it definitely is a lymph node.
In fact this lymph node was located within the breast, i.e. an intramammary lymph node, which is a benign finding. Large axillary lymph node metastases of a small irregular carcinoma
Enlarged lymph nodes:
Enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla can be the result of lymphogenic metastatic disease of breast cancer. The images are of a 50-year-old woman who presented with palpable masses in the axilla, that represented round enlarged hypoechoic lymph nodes. Subsequently there was an ultrasound examination of the breast, which revealed a small non-palpable hypoechoic irregular cancer.
Ectopic glandular tissue in the axilla:
Some women have fibroglandular breast tissue in the axilla. This tissue behaves just like the glandular tissue in the breast and may get tense or painful at some time in the menstrual cycle. The ultrasound image is of a young woman who felt a painful swelling in her axilla.
The image shows normal glandular tissue in an atypical location.
Breast implants:
Most breast implants are silicone-filled prostheses.
On ultrasound they look like a large cyst.
The implant is most commonly placed posterior to the breast tissue or posterior to the pectoral muscle. Implants filled with silicone or saline are anechoic (echolucent). In most patients, breast implants have a regular aspect with lobulated margins. Sometimes this lobulation can give the impression of a lump in the breast (figure). Collections or silicone leakage **
Silicone leakage:
When silicone leaks out of the implant it will cause a hyperechoic shadow or dirty shadow, just like we can see in the lungs caused by the air in the lungs. The image shows leakage of silicone anterior to the prosthesis. Free silicone breast injections are an alternative form of breast augmentation to breast implants.
They have serious adverse effects and are banned in many countries. The whole image looks blurred.
This is called snow storm appearance. You will get the same image as when there is massive leakage. Here a fibroadenoma anterior to a silicone implant.
Ultrasound in Men:

Gynecomastia:
Gynecomastia is the most common male breast disorder and commonly presents as a palpable lump or tenderness of the breast. Clinically, gynecomastia presents as a soft mobile tender subareolar mass. 
Any mass that is not subareolar is not gynecomastia. On ultrasound the abnormality should be located right behind the nipple. Breast cancer in men just looks like breast cancer in women. These images are of 70-year-old male who presented with a painfull swelling behind the right nipple.
Notice that there is some fibroglandular tissue on the right, while on the left there is only subcutaneous fat. Bilateral gynecomastia in an athlete taking steroids Newborns, boys going through puberty and older men may develop gynecomastia as a result of normal changes in hormone levels. A common cause of gynecomastia is the use of anabolic steroids  used by athletes to build muscle and enhance performance. This patient had used steroids and has gynecomastia on both sides.
Sometimes gynecomastia can result in images that simulate a carcinoma, like on the images here, but luckily the findings were on both sides and there was a history of steroid intake. The diagnosis of gynaecomastia is usually easier to make on a mammogram.
Nipple region:
The region of the nipple can be difficult to examine. In most cases you see only some thickening of the skin and behind the nipple some dilated ducts. This image is of a patient who presented with a retracted nipple. There is an irregular tumor behind the nipple with ingrowth into the nipple (arrow). Here another tumor behind the nipple (n). These tumors can be very difficult to detect. In every woman who complains of a retracted nipple this area should be examined carefully. This patient had a large nipple, which made it difficult to examine the region behind the nipple. A lot of gel (g) was used to get a good contact with the skin. A large tumor is seen behind the nipple.
Cardiovascular devices:

on Chest X-Ray:
Frederieke Elsinger, Robin Smithuis and Anje Spijkerboer
Vancouver General Hospital in Canada, Alrijne hospital and the Amsterdam University Medical Center, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2018-12-01 The number of implanted cardiovascular devices has dramatically increased in recent years. With the advent of implantable cardioverterdefibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy, devices have become more complex. There is also an increase of minimally invasive procedures to replace heart valves. An overview is presented of common cardiovascular devices and procedures. Radiology plays an important role in the initial assessment and follow-up of these devices.
Pacemakers:
There are two types of cardiac conduction devices (CCD's): Pacemakers can have leads, that pace: The images show a pacemaker with an atrial and ventricular lead. The tip of the atrial lead is pointed upward and anteriorly, because the ideal position is in the right atrial appendage, where it is anchored within the coarse trabeculae. The tip of the ventricular lead is positioned in the apex of the right ventricle, which is located to the left of the spine on a frontal chest X-ray and anteriorly on a lateral view. Here an example of an ICD with wires in the right atrial appendage, the apex of the right ventricle and a lead to the left ventricle in the posterior coronary vein. You can recognize the two shock coils of the ICD as thicker white bands along the course of the lead.
Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy:
Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a biventricular pacer is performed to synchronize the contraction of the right and left ventricle in patients with severe systolic heart failure and left or right bundle branch blocks or other intraventricular conduction defects. Here a biventricular pacemaker with three leads. The right atrial pacemaker lead is located in the atrial appendage. This lead first travels inferiorly into the right atrium and then turns upward and anteriorly where it is anchored within the trabeculae of the atrial appendage. The left ventricular lead travels through the right atrium and the sinus coronarius and is finally positioned posteriorly into a cardiac vein on the left.
Epicardial pacing leads:
Epicardial leads are frequently placed during cardiac surgery in order to allow cardiac pacing post-surgery. Some centers place them in all cardiac surgery patients, while others only in those who have rhythm disturbances intra-operatively. After a few days they can be removed by simple traction. Sometimes they are left in place. Retained epicardial wires do not seem to present a hazard to patients in the MR environment. However, this conclusion applied mostly to non-cardiac MR examinations. First study the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: Pacemakers can have various complications: The image is taken immediately after placement of an ICD. There is a small pneumothorax (arrow). This is the most common complication.
Aberrant lead position:
This patient has a persistent left-sided superior vena cava (LVCS). This is a rare congenital anomaly that may be found at the time of cardiac device lead insertion. The persistent LVCS communicates with the right atrium through the coronary sinus. The transvenous placement of cardiac device lead via persistent LSVC can be technically difficult and in some cases not possible.
Lead fracture:
Obvious fracture of one of the leads. Subtle lead fracture in malfunctioning pacemaker. Extremely subtle fracture line (arrow).
Retained leads:
Here a patient with an ICD with one lead and two shock coils. There is an retained lead still visible of an old pacemaker that was removed. Many patients have endocardial pacemaker leads left in place after pulse generator removal. The safety of MR in patients with retained endocardial pacemaker wires has not been systematically investigated to date. However, due to the potential threat that they may act as "antennas" with significant heating - it is not recommended to scan those patients (reference).
Twiddler's Syndrome:
Twiddler's syndrome is a malfunction of a pacemaker due to the patient's manipulation of the device and the subsequent dislodging of the leads. This results in malfunctioning of the pacemaker or sometimes stimulation of other structures like phrenic nerve or brachial plexus. Here a patient with a normally placed ICD on the left image. Months later there was malfunction due to ICD box and lead rotation (yellow arrow) and retraction (white arrow). Here another patient with the Twiddler's syndrome. Notice curling of the lead near the pacemaker and at the tip in the right ventricle (arrows). Here another patient with Twiddler. There was malfunction of the pacemaker. A new pacemaker was inserted on the right side.
Wiireless pacemaker device:
A Micra device is a small wireless pacemaker device, that is transfemorally implanted in the apex of the right ventricle. Close up view of the Micra device.
Brain stimulators:
Parkinson brain stimulators have similar generators as cardiac pacemakers and are also placed in the subcutaneous chest. They should not be confused with pacemakers.
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators:
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators or ICD's are devices that can recognize ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and terminate it by delivering an electrical shock. ICD's are implanted in patients with cardiomyopathy and a low left ventricular ejection fraction because they are at risk of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. This patient has a single coil ICD system (figure). The arrows point to the shock coil. Continue with next images. This patient has three leads: Here another patient with an ICD with only one lead and one shock coil. Here an ICD with one lead and two shock coils.
Subcutaneous ICD:
The S-ICD or subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is not connected to the heart or the vessels. A presternal wire is placed and connected to a laterally placed ICD with the heart located between the wire and the box. This system is not capable of pacing the heart.
Loop recorders:
Loop recorders are implantable cardiac monitors to continuously record the cardiac rhythm in patients with unexplained palpitations or syncope. They are placed subcutaneously. These devices are getting smaller and smaller and should not be mistaken for an USB flashdrive. Loop recorders have a variety of uses including monitoring patients with unexplained syncopal episodes and assessment of patients with atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, or conduction disturbances. These recorders can provide more than a year of monitoring that may be activated by the patient or be automatically activated. Another example of a loop recorder.
Valve replacement and repair:
This is an illustration of the heart valves in the coronal plane. The heart valves are best determined on a lateral radiograph. The aortic and pulmonary valves are above a line drawn from the apex to the base of the heart, while the mitral and tricuspid valves are below that line Here we see the normal valve position on an PA and lateral chest X-ray. On the lateral chest film the aortic and pulmonary valves are located above the line from base of the heart to the apex and tricuspid and mitral valves are below this line. Different types of valves: These are from synthetic material. These patients are on anticoagulant therapy.
* Biological or bioprosthetic valves These are made from animal valves. No anticoagulation therapy needed
Mechanical valves:
The images show some examples of mechanical heart valves. These are manufactured mechanical valves. They last for about 20 years. Patients require anticoagulantia and therefore their use is decreasing. The St. Jude bi-leaflet mechanical valve is most commonly used and has a radiopaque peripheral ring.
Bioprosthetic valves:
Here some examples of prostetic heart valves. The main limitation of bioprosthetic valves is their limited durability, which exposes the patient to the risk of valve reintervention. Last about 10-15 years but do not require anticoagulation. Typically chosen for older patients, those with a contraindication to anticoagulation or for lower velocity inflow valves (mitral and tricuspid). Aortic valve prosthesis in good position
Tricuspid valves:
Tricuspid stenosis is the result of rheumatic heart disease and is treated with valve replacement. Tricuspid regurgitation is the result of right ventricular dilatation and is treated with annuloplasty. This patient has three valves repaired: There is a pacemaker with epicardial leads. This was done, because it was thought that a normally placed lead to the right ventricle would interfere too much with the function of the tricuspid valve prosthesis. White arrow points to aortic valve. Yellow arrow points to mitral valve.
TAVR:
TAVR is a transcatheter aortic valve repair. The stenotic aortic valve is repaired by placing a prosthetic valve within the diseased valve. TAVR is for patients who have a high risk for an open procedure. The procedural success rate is 90%. TAVR is associated with higher rates of vascular injury, paravalvular regurgitation and the need for permanent pacemaker placement.
Pulmonary valves:
The Melody valve is a transcatheter pulmonary valve (TPV). It is a bovine jugular vein sewn within a platinum-iridium stent. The Melody valve is inserted through a catheter percutaneously. This Melody stent has multiple fractures (yellow arrows)
MitraClip:
In patients with severe mitral regurgitation and who are not a candidate for open heart surgery, a transcatheter mitral valve repair, known as the MitraClip, is an appropriate therapy. The centre of the mitral leaflets are approximated by the Mitraclip to reduce the regurgitation while still leaving enough room for passage of blood from the left atrium to the left ventricle (figure). Here a patient with three different valves: aortic, mitral and tricuspid. Aortic valve replacement. This patient has a Medtronic Hancock mitral valve replacement and an annuloplasty of the tricuspid valve.
Closure devices:

Atrial Septal defect:
Closure devices are used in patients with ASD and signs of right ventricle overload which can lead to heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Closure devices are often self-adjusting and lie flat against the atrial or ventricular septum. This flat design helps create a natural profile. Here a lateral view of a child with an ASD and an Amplatz closure device. A lateral view of a child with an ASD and an Umbrella Rashkind closure device. Images of a patient with an ASD and an Amplatz closure device. Here a patient with a larger defect, that was closed with two devices. Continue with the CT-images. Transverse CT-image and coronal reconstruction of the same patient. This patient has three closure devices. Dislocation of the closure device. CT demonstrates, that the Amplatz device is dislocated into the aortic arch. First look at the images. Then continue reading. This is an Amplatz cardiac plug to close the left atrial appendage. This is an alternative to oral anticoagulation for prevention of thromboembolic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation
Watchman:
A commonly used left atrial appendage closure device is the Watchman implant. It is a preventive measure for stroke caused by clots originating from the heart in patients with atrial fibrillation for which anticoagulants are contraindicated.
Patent Ductus Arteriosus:
A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a persistent communication between the descending thoracic aorta and the pulmonary artery that results from failure of normal physiologic closure of the fetal ductus. During the first 60 hours of life, spontaneous closure of the ductus occurs in 55% of full-term newborn infants. By 2-6 months of age, closure occurs in more than 95% of healthy infants. Large PDA in older children and adults can lead to pulmonary hypertension and chronic heart failure as a result of a left-to-right shunt. These are images of a patient with a persistent ductus arteriosus. The ductus was closed with an Amplatz plug device.
Scimitar vein plugging:
Scimitar syndrome is characterized by partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, in which an abnormal right pulmonary vein drains into the inferior vena cava. Correction is indicated in adults with signs of pulmonary volume overload or right heart dilation. Images: Scimitar vein pre- end post plugging.
Vascular Stents:

Coarctation:
Intravascular stent therapy is considered a primary therapeutic option for most adults and adolescents with coarctation of the aorta (refence). Image: intravascular stent in good position. Continue... MRA-image of the same patient pre-stenting. CTA-image post-stenting. Image: dislocated stent. ..
TEVAR:
Thoracic EndoVascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) is a procedure that involves placement of a covered stent in the aorta in patients with a symptomatic thoracic aneurysm. The stent graft is delivered in a collapsed state through a catheter, that is most often inserted into the femoral artery and positioned using X-ray guidance. The stent graft is then expanded to span and cover the site of aortic injury (reference).
Coronary stents:
X-rays show a stent projecting over the anterior ventricle wall, where the LAD is located. First look at the images. Then continue reading. Where are the stents positioned? The coronary stents are positioned in the right coronary artery (yellow arrow) and the left anterior descending artery (white arrow). First look at the images. Then continue reading. Where are the stents positioned? The coronary stents are positioned in the left circumflex artery (yellow arrow) and the left anterior descending artery (white arrow).
Left ventricular assist device:
A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a surgically implanted device that takes over ventricular pump function in patients with severely impaired ejection fraction. They were initially implanted as a bridge to cardiac transplant or during myocardial recovery, but are now also used in patients not suitable for transplant. Here we see a patient with a LVAD. The outflow cannula is inserted in the apex and the radiolucent outflow cannula is connected to the ascending aorta. Also note the triple lead, double shock coil ICD and previous LIMA graft clips.
Impella:
An Impella is a small, temporary heart pump, attached to a transfemoral (or axillary) catheter. 
It is intended for short term use (from 6 hours to < 14 days, depending on the type) during high risk PCI or in patients recovering from AMI cardiogenic shock. The Impella’s inlet is placed in the left ventricle, where blood is apirated and delivered to the outlet which is situated in the ascending aorta. The Chest X-Ray shows correct placement of impella with inlet (yellow arrow) and outlet (white arrow) in the left ventricle and acsending aorta. In this video you can watch how the impella works.
Intra-aortic balloon pump:
The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a mechanical device that increases myocardial oxygen perfusion and indirectly increases cardiac output through afterload reduction. It consists of a cylindrical polyurethane balloon that sits in the aorta, approximately 2 centimeters (0.79 in) from the left subclavian artery. The balloon inflates and deflates via counter pulsation, meaning it actively deflates in systoleand inflates in diastole. Systolic deflation decreases afterload through a vacuum effect and indirectly increases forward flow from the heart. Diastolic inflation increases blood flow to the coronary arteries via retrograde flow. These actions combine to decrease myocardial oxygen demand and increase myocardial oxygen supply (reference).
Vascular surgery clips - CABG:
The standard bypass operation involves LIMA-to-LAD graft combined with vein grafts. LIMA stands for Left internal mammary artery bypass graft. The distal LIMA is anastomosed with the post-stenotic LAD and surgical clips extend from the apex of the aortic arch (image). RIMA grafts are used less frequently because of lower patency and because the RIMA is shorter and usually does not reach the target arteries. The left IMA is separated from the chest wall and connected to the coronary target vessel distal to the stenosis. The radiograph shows the vascular clips of a left and right IMA CABG.
Mini Maze procedure:
The Mini Maze procedure is a minimally-invasive ablation in patients with persistent atrium fibrillation. Through incisions in the chest wall a thoracoscope is introduced to allow direct visualization of the heart. Next the ablation device produces conduction blocks in areas like around the pulmonary veins to prevent erratic electric signals. A clipping device called Atriclip is placed to close the left atrial appendage to avoid thrombi from this area (figure).
ICU monitoring device:
.....
Swan Ganz catheter:
The Swan GAnz catheter is a flow directed balloon tip catheter. The balloon is inflated within the left or right main pulmonary artery to measure the capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary artery pressure. Potential complications are intracardiac knotting, pulmonary infarction, pulmonary artery perforation, arrhythmias, cardiac perforation, and placement in the inferior vena cava. The images show anincorrect placement of the Swan Ganz catheter on the left with the tip in the left upper lobe pulmonary artery branch. The second X-ray shows adequate position of the catheter tip in the left pulmonary artery after repositioning. by Yingxu Ma et al Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Aug; 97(34): e11965.

Paediatric Radiology and Neonatology of the Emma's Children Hospital, Academical Medical Center, Amsterdam:
Publicationdate 2013-11-05 In this review we will discuss the normal and abnormal position of tubes and lines on a neonatal chest x-ray.
Umbilical artery line:
Umbilical artery catheterization provides direct access to the arterial system and allows accurate measurement of arterial blood pressure, blood sampling and intravascular access for fluids and medications. The catheter should be passed through the umbilic artery and enter the aorta via the internal iliac artery. It should demonstrate the typical loop from the umbilicus inferiorly into the internal iliac artery. In order to avoid placement into aortic branches, the catheter should be either in a high position above the celiac, mesenteric and renal arteries or in a low position below the inferior mesenteric artery: The high position is advisable since it leads to less vascular complications (15). Umbilical artery line (2) First study the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: Umbilical artery line (3) First study the images. Then continue reading.

Umbilical vein catheter:
An umbilical vein catheter should pass through the umbilic vein into the left portal vein. Then through the ductus venosus into a hepatic vein and the inferior caval vein (IVC). The tip should be positioned in the IVC at the level of the diaphragm. Several line malpositions are possible: Not all medication can be administered through a line in this position.
* Intrahepatic into the portal venous system, both right and left, or even into the superior mesenteric or splenic vein. This can cause thrombosis.
* Perforation of the portal vein can cause haemorrhage or abscess formation in the liver.
* Position too deep in right atrium or in the left atrium through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or perforation. Umbilical venous line (2) First study the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: Umbilical venous line (3) First study the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: It illustrates the umbilical vein line following the traject of the umbilical vein into the liver (blue arrow). The line is not deep enough.

The findings are: Umbilical venous line (5) Study the image. Then continue reading. The findings are: Umbilical venous line (6) Study the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: It should be 1 cm above the trachea bifurcation. Umbilical venous line (7
) Study the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: The line probably went through a patent foramen ovale and through the left atrium into a pulmonary vein. In this patient ultrasound detected a thrombus in the left portal vein after umbilical venous line (arrows). Catheter malposition in the left portal vein increases the occurrence of portal venous thrombosis. Clinically silent portal venous thrombosis is frequently associated with catheterization of the umbilical vein in critically ill neonates, and spontaneous resolution without any treatment is expected in many cases. Umbilical venous line (8
) Study the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: Notice that the endotracheal tube is too deep.
Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter:
A peripheral inserted central catheter or PICC line is positioned in the great vessels, preferably in the superior or inferior caval vein. It is important for the neonatologist to know if the line is in a superficial position, because then not all medication can be given. The left image shows a PICC line, that was placed in the left arm. It was hard to determine the exact location of the tip. The lumen of the line was filled with contrast, showing the tip of the line high in the superior caval vein. It is advised not to use more contrast than the volume of the line, in order to prevent hypothyroidism in reaction to iodine containing contrast, although the risk is low. (16) PICC line (2) Study the image. Then continue reading. The findings are: *PICC line* (3) Study the image. Then continue reading. The findings are: Probably located in the coronary sinus or in the left atrium after passing through a patent foramen ovale. *PICC line* (4) Study the image. Then continue reading. The findings are:
Endotracheal tube:
The tip of an endotracheal tube should be inbetween the thoracic aperture and 1 cm above the carina. The tip travels downward if the neck is flexed or upward if the neck is extended. The most common malpositioning is in the right mainstem bronchus, because of the shallower angle of the right main bronchus. Here a good positioned tube in a patient with a pneumothorax on the left. Endotracheal tube (2) Study the image. Then continue reading. The findings are: Endotracheal tube (3) Study the image. Then continue reading. The findings are: Endotracheal tube (4) Study the image. Then continue reading. The findings are:
Chest drainage tube:
Chest drainage tube are placed in case of respiratory distress caused by pleural fluid or pneumothorax in order to allow sufficient expansion of the lung for ventilation. The tube should be positioned in the midaxillary line via the 4th - 6th intercostal space. The position should be apical anterior in patients with a pneumothorax. Study the image. Then continue reading. The findings are: In this patient, who has a large pneumatocele, a pigtail catheter is placed in the pneumatocele. Complications of chest tubes are: This will result in an aberrant position of the drain and dysfunction.
Gastric catheters:
Gastric catheters should be positioned with the tip in the stomach.
Reploggel's suction catheter:
Replogle's suction catheters are used in case of oesophageal atresia to remove saliva. They are positioned in the blind ending oesophagus. The markings of a Replogle's suction catheter form a dashed line. Here a preterm infant with oesophageal atresia with a fistula. There is a Reploggel's drain in situ. Notice deep position of endotracheal tube and atelectasis of left upper lobe.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation:
Extra corporal membrane oxygenation or ECMO is a extracorporeal technique to oxygenate the child when conventional circulatory and respiratory supportfails. One sheet is placed in the superior caval vein and one in the brachiocephalic artery. by Barrington KJ. et al Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 1999, Issue 1.

HRCT - Common diagnoses:
Robin Smithuis, Otto van Delden and Cornelia Schaefer-Prokop
Radiology Department of the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp and the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2007-12-20 / update 2022-03-15 In this review we present the key findings in the most common interstitial lung diseases. There are numerous interstitial lung diseases, but in clinical practice only about ten diseases account for approximately 90% of cases. Knowledge of both radiological and clinical appearances of these more common interstitial lung diseases is therefore important for recognizing them in daily practice and including them in the differential diagnosis. Some less common interstitial lung diseases will also be presented because their HRCT presentation may be very typical, allowing for a 'spot diagnosis' in selected cases. In 'HRCT - basic interpretation' the terminology is introduced and a practical approach is given for the interpretation of HRCT examinations.
Introduction:
More than 100 entities manifest as diffuse lung disease. Fortunately only about 10 of these account for about 90% of all diffuse lung diseases, that are assessed by open lung biopsy. Knowing the common and also uncommon HRCT-presentations of these frequently encountered diffuse lung diseases is extremely important. On the left you find three different lists of diagnoses. Accounting for 80 - 90% of all diagnoses according to various literature references. In some of them the old names are used and in some the newer ones. The 'mnemonic' for the first list is 'SHIT FACED' (alternative shaded fit).
Sarcoidosis:
Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder of unknown origin. It is characterized by non-caseating granulomas in multiple organs, that may resolve spontaneously or progress to fibrosis. Pulmonary manifestations are present in 90% of patients. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats and weight loss are common. Loefgren's syndrome, an acute presentation of sarcoidosis, consists of arthritis, erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar adenopathy and occurs in 9-34% of patients. Erythema nodosum is seen predominantly in women and arthritis is more common in men. Two third of patients have a remission within ten years. One third have continuing disease leading to clinically significant organ impairment. Less than 5% of patients die from sarcoidosis usually as a result of pulmonary fibrosis. Sarcoidosis stage I: left and right hilar and paratracheal adenopathy (1-2-3 sign) Stages Chest films in sarcoidosis have been classified into four stages: These stages do not indicate disease chronicity or correlate with changes in pulmonary function. Images
A patient with stage I disease. There is hilar and paratracheal adenopathy and no sign of pulmonary involvement. Sarcoidosis: typical presentation with nodules along the bronchovascular bundle and fthe issuresNotice the partially calcified node in the left hilum. HRCT findings in Sarcoidosis Image
A typical presentation of sarcoidosis with hilar lymphadenopathy and small nodules along bronchovascular bundles (yellow arrow) and along fissures (red arrows). Image
A detailed view with the typical HRCT-presentation with nodules along bronchovascular bundle (red arrow) and fissures (yellow arrow). This is the typical perilymphatic distribution of the nodules. Sarcoidosis: typical presentation The HRCT appearance of pulmonary sarcoidosis varies greatly and is known to mimic many other diffuse infiltrative lung diseases. Approximately 60 to 70% of patients with sarcoidosis have characteristic radiologic findings. In 25 to 30% of cases the radiologic findings are atypical. In 5 to 10% of patients the chest radiograph is normal. On the left another typical presentation of sarcoidosis with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and small nodules in a perilymphatic distribution along bronchovascular bundles and along fissures (yellow arrows). Always look for small nodules along the fissures, because this is a very specific and typical sign of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis with conglomerate masses of fibrous tissue Fibrosis in Sarcoidosis. Progressive fibrosis in sarcoidosis may lead to peribronchovascular (perihilar) conglomerate masses of fibrous tissue. The typical location is posteriorly in the upper lobes, leading to volume loss of the upper lobes with displacement of the interlobar fissure. Other diseases that commonly result in this appearance are: Sarcoidosis with fibrosis in the upper lobes. Typical chest film. Here a typical chest film of long standing sarcoidosis (stage IV) with fibrosis in the upper zones and volume loss of the upper lobes resulting in hilar elevation. Fibrosis results in obliteration of pulmonary vessels, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension. Sarcoidosis with fibrosis in the upper lobes. Typical HRCT findings. Here another case of stage IV sarcoidosis. Notice the distribution of the conglomerate masses of fibrosis in the posterior part of the lungs. In addition there are multiple small well-defined nodules. Some of these nodules have the typical subpleural distribution. Enable Scroll

The appearance resembles a ground glass attenuation, but with a closer look you may appreciate that the increased attenuation is the result of many tiny grouped nodules. Also notice the hilar lymphadenopathy. 47-year old female patient treated for possible infection Alveolar Sarcoidosis (2) On the left a 47-year old female patient with a dry cough, slightly breathless and a normal blood analysis. A chest film was taken and she was treated with antibiotics. A follow up film was made, because she did not improve. The first chest film shows bilateral consolidations in the lower lobes (arrow), initially interpreted as infection. After two weeks of treatment with antibiotics, there is no improvement. The differential diagnosis now includes tumor (bronchoalveolar carcinoma or lymphoma), eosinophilic pneumonia , organizing pneumonia, Wegener's disease or an uncommon presentation of sarcoidosis. Now continue with the HRCT. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images on the left . There are multiple areas of consolidation. Ancillary findings are hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The differental diagnosis of the CT-images is basically the same as of the chest film. Histology revealed alveolar sarcoid. There is only one clue to the diagnosis and that is the presence of small nodules that can be identified in image 3, but these are difficult to see. This case nicely demonstrates that sarcoidosis truely is 'the great mimicker'. Sarcoidosis should be therefore in our differential diagnostic list!. On the left a case of fibrosing sarcoidosis, showing fibrosis, traction bronchiectases and crowding of the involved bronchi, predominantly in the perihilar region and upper lobes. Nodular abnormalities are absent, but the appearance and the location of the fibrosis are very suggestive of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Differential diagnosis of Sarcoidosis. On the left some diseases with a nodular pattern.
Silicosis / Coal worker pneumoconiosis:
Silicosis and Coal worker pneumoconiosis (CWP) are pathologically distinct entities with differing histology, resulting from the inhalation of different inorganic dusts. The radiographic and HRCT appearances of these diseases, however, may not be distinguishable from each other and may be similar to sarcoidosis. It is important to realize that these diseases are rare compared to sarcoidosis. Silicosis and CWP occur in a specific patient group (construction workers, mining workers, workers exposed to sandblasting, glass blowing and pottery). HRCT findings in Silicosis/CWP On the left a case of silicosis showing nodules of varying sizes with a random and subpleural distribution.
One nodule contains calcification (arrow).
Note the absence of a lymphatic distribution pattern (peribronchovascular and along fissures), which would be suggestive of sarcoidosis. Same patient with silicosis as previous images showing a conglomerate mass in a perihilar location in the right upper lobe. The left lobe shows multiple nodules of varying size. Differential diagnosis of Silicosis / Pneumoconiosis.
Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis:
Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis results from hematogenous spread to the lung, with subsequent invasion of interstitium and lymphatics. The presenting symptoms are dyspnea and cough and can predate the radiographic abnormalities. In many cases however the patients are asymptomatic. Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis is seen in carcinoma of the lung, breast, stomach, pancreas, prostate, cervix, thyroid and metastatic adenocarcinoma from an unknown primary. HRCT findings in Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis Image
A patient with Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis. Notice the focal distribution. This finding is helpful in distinguishing Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis from other causes of interlobular septal thickening like pulmonary edema or sarcoid. There is also lymphadenopathy. Image
Another patient with Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis with interlobular septal thickening (yellow arrow). Additional pleural fluid (blue arrow) and a lung metastasis (circle). Examples of  Lymphangitic carcinomatosis and differential diagnosis
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema:
Patients with pulmonary edema are not imaged with HRCT as their diagnosis is usually based on a combination of clinical and chest radiographic findings. However sometimes the diagnosis is not that straightforward and knowledge of the HRCT appearance of pulmonary edema can be helpful in avoiding misdiagnosis. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema HRCT findings in cardiogenic pulmonary edema On the left typical features of cardiogenic pulmonary edema There is smooth septal thickening and some ground glass opacity in the dependent part of the lungs. In addition there is bilateral pleural fluid. In a patient with a known malignancy lymphangitic carcinomatosis would be high in the differential diagnostic list. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema Differential diagnosis of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. On the left another example of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This patient had a CT to rule out pulmonary emboli. There is smooth septal thickening and ground glass opacity in a more patchy distribution. Note: edema can have a very unusual appearance and be distributed very patchy: some areas are filled with fluid as opposed to other areas in immediate vicinity which appear normal.
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis:
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA). HP is an allergic lung disease caused by the inhalation of a variety of antigens (farmer's lung, bird fancier's lung, 'hot tub' lung, humidifier lung). The radiographic and pathologic abnormalities in patients can be classified into acute, subacute, and chronic stages. Mostly HRCT is performed in the subacute stage of HP, weeks to months following the first exposure to the antigen or in the chronic phase. Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis with ill-defined centrilobular nodules Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis The key findings in the subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis are: Here two examples of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. There are ill-defined centrilobular nodules of ground-glass opacity. Here another case of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. There is subtle opacity in the centre of the secondary lobules (arrows) with sparing of the subpleural region. This HRCT-image also demonstrates subtle centrilobular opacity in a patient with subacute HP. Notice how ill-defined these centrilobular nodules are. Sometimes the centrilobular opacities are more nodular in appearance as in this case. Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis with mosaic pattern Here another case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. There is a mosaic pattern. Some secundary lobules demonstrate ground-glass opacity due to lung infiltration, while others are more lucent due to bronchiolitis with air trapping. LEFT: HRCT at presentation. RIGHT: HRCT ten days later This patient presented with acute dyspnoe and a normal chest film (not shown). The HRCT at presentation (left) shows lobular areas of ground glass attenuation. A control HRCT ten days later (right) demonstrated, that the findings had resolved without any treatment. The findings were thought to be due to hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Nonspecific chest film, typical HRCT-findings. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis The key findings in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis are: On the left a patient with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The HRCT shows a mosaic pattern with hyperaerated secondary nodules and secondry nodules of increased attenuation. Additionally there is septal and intralobular reticular thickening, indicating already existing irreversible fibrosis. UIP with honeycombing (left) and chronic HP (right) Differential diagnosis of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis. Chronic stage: UIP has a strong lower zone distribution. In chronic HP fibrotic changes are typically seen throughout the whole lung parenchyma from the periphery towards the centrum. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (2) The case on the left shows an inspiratory and expiratory scan: the mosaic pattern with areas of ground-glass attenuation and areas of low attenuation, that become more evident on the expiratory scan, indicating air trapping. Signs of fibrosis such as distorted vessels and bronchi as well as septal thickening are more pronounced in the mid and lower lung zones, but not limited to the subpleural area. The images on the left suggest the diagnosis hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Based on the imaging findigs alone, alveolar proteinosis and other diseases with a mozaic pattern should be included in the differential diagnosis.
Tuberculosis:
Primary TB:
Initial infection with consolidation, adenopathy and pleural effusion.
Secondary TB  :
Post-primary or reactivation TB. This is the reactivation of the original infection. Usually located in the apical segments of upper lobes with cavitation
Endobronchial spread: May occur in both primary and secondary TB, when the infection is not contained.
Hematogenous spread (miliary TB): May occur in both primary and secondary TB, when the infection is not contained. TB: cavitating lesion and endobronchial spread HRCT findings in TB On the left a patient with TB.
There is a cavitating lesion and typical tree-in-bud appearance.
The blue arrow indicates the biopsy needle. Miliary TB Miliary TB This represents a hematogenous dissemination of infection and may occur in association with either primary or postprimary disease. It is characterized by uniform small nodules with a random distribution. TB with cavitation Cavitation in TB The chest film on the left shows diffuse areas with nodular air space opacifications. The HRCT demonstrates multiple nodules in peribronchial distribution, partially confluent, and a cavitation in the right lung, strongly suggestive for tuberculosis. Other diseases in the differential are Wegener granulomatosis or malignancy (both show no tree-in-bud). Endobronchial spread of TB with tree-in-bud Endobronchial spread of TB This can occur with primary or postprimary infection. In most subjects, the primary infection is localized and clinically inapparent. However, in 5 to 10% of patients with primary TB, the infection is poorly contained and dissemination occurs. This is termed progressive primary tuberculosis. Extensive cavitation of the tuberculous pneumonia lead to endobronchial spread of the infection. Rupture of necrotic lymph nodes into the bronchi can also result in endobronchial dissemination. Tree-in-bud appearance is typical for active endobronchial spread of infection. It occurs in acute tuberculosis but also in any other bacterial infection. LEFT: miliary TB. RIGHT: metastases Differential diagnosis of TB. In both miliary TB and metastases the nodules have a random distribution. In miliary TB the nodules are more uniform in size. Images
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia:
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is an idiopathic condition characterized by filling of the alveoli with eosinophils. It is associated with an increased number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood and patients present with fever, cough, weight loss, malaise, and shortness of breath. The symptoms are often severe and last three months or more. Patients respond promptly to treatment with steroids. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia HRCT findings in Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia On the left a contrast enhanced CT in a patient with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. Notice peripheral distribution of the consolidations. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (left) versus Organizing pneumonia (right) Differential diagnosis of Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia The images on the left show the similarities between chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and organizing pneumonia. Differentiation has to be made on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings.
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia:
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) or pneumocystis jiroveci as it is currently named, is an opportumistic infection in immunocompromised patients. PCP used to affect most HIV-infected patients at some point during the course of their disease, but with the new anti-viral drugs it has become less common. Nowadays PCP is seen more in immunosuppressed patients, i.e. transplant recipients and patients on chemotherapy. HRCT findings in PCP PCP with diffuse ground-glass opacification On the left an immunocompromised patient with PCP. The CT findings are diffuse ground-glass opacification. The findings are not specific for PCP, but in this clinical setting PCP is the most likely diagnosis. Enable Scroll

ARDS:
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a sudden, life-threatening lung failure requiring mechanical ventilation. ARDS represents the result of increased permeability often in combination with injury to the respiratory epithelium. A variety of underlying conditions, from infections to major trauma, can cause ARDS. Primary pulmonary risk factors include aspiration, pneumonia, toxic inhalation and pulmonary contusion. 
Extrapulmonary  risk factors are sepsis, pancreatitis, multiple blood transfusions, trauma and the use of drugs such as heroin. Mild forms of ARDS may resolve completely, while severe forms result in irreverible fibrosis. Why some people develop ARDS and others do not is unknown. Extra-pulmonary ARDS with gravity dependent gradient Extra-pulmonary ARDS On the left a patient who was involved in a traffic accident and within hours developed ARDS. The dominant pattern is ground glass opacity. In the dependent parts of the lung there is also some consolidation, so there is a gradient from front to back. An important finding in extra-pulmonary ARDS is the symmetry of the abnormalities. Pulmonary ARDS with asymmetric patchy distribution of consolidations. Pulmonary ARDS On the left a patient who developed ARSD as a result of pneumonia (i.e. pulmonary ARDS). Note the patchy distribution of lung disease and the almost complete distorsion more basal. Patient is ventilated with PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure ) leading to a barotrauma of the lung parenchyma: there are multiple subpleural cysts and a bilateral pneumothorax. LEFT: ARDS. RIGHT: Fibrosis in the anterior parts as a result of damage related to barotraumas and PEEP ventilation Consolidations have a protecting effect on the lung parenchyma under PEEP ventilation, while the ventrally located areas of more normal lung are most prone to the effects of barotrauma. As a result we find cystic destruction ventrally and residual fibrosis mostly in the ventral lung areas.
Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias:
The idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) comprise a heterogenous group of disorders. They represent fundamental responses of the lung to injury and do not represent 'diseases' per se. Idiopathic indicates unknown cause and interstitial pneumonia refers to involvement of the lung parenchyma by varying combinations of fibrosis and inflammation. IIPs include seven entities listed in the table on the left in order of relative frequency. These diseases have specific patterns of morphologic findings on HRCT and histology. Before we call these findings idiopathic or cryptogenic, we should realise, that these patterns are also common findings in collagen vascular diseases (e.g., sclerodermia, rheumatoid arthritis) and drug-related lung diseases. For instance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis findings of NSIP, UIP, OP and LIP have been reported.
UIP:
Usual Interstitial Pneumonitis (UIP) is a histologic diagnosis. UIP has distinctive HRCT findings and is usually shown at lungbiopsy, when honeycombing is visible.
If the UIP pattern is of unknown cause (i.e. idiopathic), the disease is called Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF accounts for more than 60% of the cases of UIP. In the presence of a surgical biopsy showing a UIP pattern the diagnosis of IPF requires exclusion of other known causes of UIP including drug toxicities, environmental exposures (asbest), and collagen vascular diseases like RA, SLE, polyarteritis nodosa and sclerodermia. A long list of drugs have been implicated, but this pattern is most commonly the result of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as bleomycin, busulfan, vincristine, methotrexate, adriamycin, and carmustine (BCNU). The differentiation between NSIP and UIP has tremendous prognostic implication for the patient. UIP is more progressive and more than 50% of patients with UIP die within 3 years. Chest film in a patient with UIP demonstrating the reticular pattern in basal and subpleural distribution due to honeycombing. On the left a chest film of a patient with UIP due to IPF. The findings on the chest film comprise volume loss and fibrotic changes in the basal lung area. The radiographic appearance of honeycombing comprises reticular densities caused by the thick walls of the cysts. Whenever you see a chest film with long standing reticulation with a lower lobe and peripheral preference also think 'UIP'. Typical UIP HRCT findings in UIP Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll UIP: Lower lobe predominance Differential diagnosis of UIP. Chronic HP may be indistinguishable. It is suspected if there is a mosaic pattern with sparing of the lung bases or when there are centrilobular nodules. Sarcoidosis is a more likely diagnosis if the fibrosis is located in the posterior parts of the upper lobes or in the perihilar area and if there are also nodules in a perilymphatic distribution or if there is extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The presence of pleural plaques helps for the differentiation between IPF and asbestosis. On the left a patient with UIP. Notice the honeycombing and the preference of the subpleural and basal lung areas. UIP: Typical case It is usually easy to recognize the pattern of UIP on HRCT.
NSIP:
Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is by some considered as a specific entity, with specific histologic characteristics, but by others as a 'wastebasket' diagnosis, representing cases of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia that cannot be classified as UIP, DIP, or OP. NSIP is histologically characterized by a homogeneous, uniform pattern of cellular interstitial inflammation associated with variable degrees of fibrosis. In contrast, UIP is associated with extensive fibrosis which is temporally inhomogeneous (i.e. various lesions are of different ages). NSIP is a very inhomogeneous group. NSIP ranges from type I which is a cellular pattern seen as ground glass opacity on HRCT to type IV with a fibrotic pattern, which may be indistinguishable from UIP. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images. On the left a patient with a NSIP. This patient had a rash and muscle weakness. Scroll through the images. The predominant finding is ground glass opacity (GGO). There is very subtle traction bronchiectasis, indicating that the GGO is the result of fibrosis and therefore irreversible. It is important to note that we do not see the classic distribution of UIP, from which NSIP has to be differentiated. The history of this patient is suggestive for the diagnosis dermatomyositis. NSIP is by far the most common interstitial lung disease in patients with connective tissue disease. NSIP (2) NSIP is not a diagnosis on it's own. It is a pattern of lung damage. For the pathologist the key feature is the uniformity of the abnormality within the lung. The role of the radiologist is more to 'exclude UIP pattern' rather than to make the diagnosis of NSIP. The diagnosis of NSIP requires histological proof. In all patients with a NSIP pattern, the clinician should be advised to look for connective tissue diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or drugs . On the left two cases of NSIP. Note the varying combination of GGO and fibrosis (traction bronchiectasis), but the lack of honeycombing. NSIP (3) NSIP is the prevalent lung pattern in systemic sclerosis and polymyosisits/dermatomyositis (more than 90%), but also may occur in RA, SLE, Sj?gren's and MCTD. In the images on your left you can appreciate again the spectrum of findings seen in NSIP. All three patients were suffering from connective tissue disease, all cases were biopsy proven. The first (top left) shows a very subtle GGO. Note the difference in the density of the air within the bronchus and surrounding lungparenchyma (dark bronchus sign). The second (top right) is a more obvious example of GGO with a superimposed fine reticular densities as a result of thickening of the intralobular septa. The last image also shows GGO with a fine reticular pattern. Notice the lack of honeycombing in all three cases, excluding UIP as diagnosis. NSIP (4) The HRCT of this patient with scleroderma and NSIP shows a fine subpleural reticular pattern in the upper lobes and more extensive abnormalities in the lower lung zones. There are also areas of ground-glass and traction bronchiectases, but honeycombing is typically lacking. Note also the mildly dilated esophagus, which is consistent with scleroderma.
COP:
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) used to be described as bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) in an earlier version of the classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. It is a inflammatory process in which the healing process is characterized by organization of the exudate rather than by resorption ('unresolved pneumonia'). Organizing pneumonia is mostly idiopathic and then called cryptogenic, but is also seen in patients with pulmonary infection, drug reactions, collagen vascular disease, Wegener's granulomatosis and after toxic-fume inhalation. OP presents with a several-month history of nonproductive cough, low-grade fever, malaise and shortness of breath. There is a good response to corticosteroid therapy and a good prognosis. OP is again a great mimicker and can show a broad variety of HRCT findings, which makes it a frequent differential diagnosis and actually represents a diagnosis of exclusion. Frequently biopsy is needed for final proof. HRCT findings in OP On the left a patient with the typical bilateral peripheral consolidations of OP. After exclusion of other diseases such as lymphoma, infection, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, the diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia was made. OP in a patient with collagen vascular disease On the left a patient who complained of arthritic pain. There are multiple small bilateral peripheral consolidations. The findings in this patient are not as specific as in the former case, but this was also organizing pneumonia, but now related to collagen vascular disease. OP in rheumatoid arthritis On the left a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and bilateral peripheral consolidations as a result of organizing pneumonia. Patients with OP associated with collagen vascular diseases respond less well to therapy with steroids. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (left) versus Organizing pneumonia (right) Differential diagnosis of Organizing Pneumonia. The images on the left show the similarities between chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and organizing pneumonia. Differentiation has to be made on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings.
RB-ILD and DIP:
Respiratory bronchiolitis (RB), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), and desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) represent different degrees of severity of small airway and parenchymal reaction to cigarette smoke (8). All smokers have various degrees of respiratory bronchiolitis, but it is usually asymptomatic. However 5-10% of smokers have a clinically significant lung disease in association with RB, presenting with symptoms, lung function tests and auscultatory findings at clinical examination. The term RB-ILD was proposed to describe the bronchocentric (or centrilobular) lung disease in these patients and the term DIP was used to describe the more diffuse disorder. Radiologically however these diseases cannot be clearly separated because of the overlap of CT findings. HRCT findings in RB-ILD On the left a patient with RB-ILD. The dominant feature is ground glass opacification and there are some thickened interlobular septa (arrow). Usually these patients will also have smoking induced centrilobular emphysema and there is some evidence that respiratory bronchiolitis is the precursor of emphysema. RB-ILD (2) On the left a smoker with RB-ILD with subtle HRCT-findings. The dominant pattern is ground glass opacification. Additional findings in this patient are paraseptal emphysema in the upper lobes and some subtle septal thickening in the basal parts. Based on these non-specific CT findings there is a broad differential diagnosis and additional clinical information is mandatory for the interpretion of the HRCT. Since this patient is a smoker we first think RB-ILD. In a immunocompromised patient PCP would be on top of the list. If this patient was coughing up blood, this probably would be pulmonary hemorrhage (although we would expect more pulmonary densities in these patients). If this patient was a bird-fancier we would first think hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but mostly these patients do not smoke. LEFT: RB-ILD in smoker. RIGHT: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in non-smoker On the left two different patients with similarl HRCT findings. The left one is a smoker with RB-ILD and the patient on the right has hypersensitivity pneumonits.
Note the difference in severity of ground glass opacities and the well defined areas of airtrapping in HP. Somehow smoking seems to protect against HP. This is not a 100% specific criterium but is quite helpful for differential diagnosis. RB-ILD (3) On the left a patient with DIP. The HRCT shows diffuse areas of ground-glass density in the lower lobes and some mosaic pattern as the sole abnormality. Reticular abnormalities and signs of fibrosis are typically absent. These abnormalities are usually reversible and will disappear upon cessation of smoking. AIP
AIP:
Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP, earlier named Hamman Rich Pneumonitis) is a rare idiopathic lung disease characterized by diffuse alveolar damage with subsequent fibrosis. It has a fatal outcome in many cases. The histologic pattern aswell as the HRCT findings in AIP are indistinguishable from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The HRCT characteristics are diffuse or patchy consolidation, often with a crazy paving appearance like in the case on the left. There are areas of consolidation and extensive areas of ground-glass density with a crazy-paving appearance.
 These abnormalities developed in several days and this rapid progression of disease combined with these imaging findings are very suggestive of the diagnosis AIP.
LIP:
Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis or LIP is uncommon, being seen mainly in patients with autoimmune disease, particularly Sj?gren's syndrome, and in patients with AIDS. Symptoms are nonspecific and often those of the patient's underlying disease HRCT findings are usually nonspecific. On the left a patient with Sjogren's syndrome with LIP. Lymphangiomyomatosis, LIP and Langerhans cell histiocytosis On the left three different patients with lung cysts. From left to right: Lymphangiomyomatosis, LIP and Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
Drug-induced lung disease:
Drug-induced lung disease is a major source of iatrogenic lung injury. The major diagnostic problem is, that it may present with a large variety of radiologic patterns. It may present as organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or even as ARDS. The diagnosis of drug-induced pulmonary disease is usually one of exclusion. Drug-induced interstitial lung fibrosis On the left a patient who is treated with cytotoxic drugs for a hematologic malignancy. The radiographic findings are areas of ground glass opacity, some traction bronchiectasis and subtle honeycombing in the left lower lobe. This could be the result of an idiopathic form of fibrosis like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis or fibrosis in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and longstanding sarcoid. However it is not one of the typical forms of fibrosis, that we commonly encounter in patients with a UIP pattern or NSIP pattern seen in collagenvascular diseases. When there is fibrosis, that does not fit into any of the common diseases with fibrosis always consider drug-related lung disease in the differential. Drug-induced organizing pneumonia Drug-induced organizing pneumonia is commonly caused by Bleomycin and Cyclophosphamide and other drugs like Methotrexate, Amiodarone, Nitrofurantoin and Penicillamine (9). The HRCT findings are the same as in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Drug-induced non-specific interstitial pneumonita (NSIP) occurs most commonly as a manifestation of carmustine toxicity or of toxicity from noncytotoxic drugs such as amiodarone. The radiologic findings are the same as in other forms of NSIP.
Uncommon interstitial lung diseases:

Lymphangiomyomatosis:
Clinical findings: Key findings in Lymphangiomyomatosis: On the left a typical case of LAM with multiple evenly spread thin walled cysts complicated by a pneumothorax. . Differential diagnosis of Lymphangiomyomatosis: On the left another typical case of LAM.
Langerhans cell histiocytosis:
Langerhans cell histiocytosis is also known as pulmonary histiocytosis X or eosinophilic granuloma. LCH is probably an allergic reaction to cigarette smoke since more than 90% of patients are active smokers. In the early nodular stage it is characterized by a centrilobular granulomatous reaction by Langerhans histiocytes. In the cystic stage bronchiolar obliteration causes alveolar wall fibrosis and cyst formation. Early stage Langerhans cell histiocytosis with small nodules HRCT findings in Langerhans cell histiocytosis: On the left early stage Langerhans cell histiocytosis with small nodules. There are no cysts visible. Late stage Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. Cysts progress to typical bizarre shaped cysts. In a later stage the nodules start to cavitate and become cysts. These cysts start as round structures but finally coalesce to become the typical bizarre shaped cysts of LCH. In patients with LCH 95% have a smoking history. Specimen of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in three different stages On the left radiological pathological correlation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in respectively nodular stage and early and late cystic stage. Langerhans' cell histiocytosis On the left a chest film of a 19 year old patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The dominant findig on the chest film is a reticular patern and that's about as far as you can go. There is also hyperinflation. No way you would have recognized that this pattern was caused by multiple cysts. This is late stage Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The most challenging differential diagnosis in this patient is centrilobular emphysema. Emphysema however is defined as airspaces without definable walls. Usually we can identify the central dot sign. The upper lobe predominance is not helpfull in the differential as we can appreciate this in many inhalational diseases and also in emphysema. Langerhans cell histiosytosis: early phase and late phase On the left another case of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. It started as small noduli, which progressed over time to cavitating nodules. In the end this will progress to bizarre shaped cysts, that replace normal lung tissue. Video
Images of a young male smoker with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Notice progression on second scan 7 years later. Differential diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Emphysema mimicking Langerhans cell histiocytosis Emphysema, when it is severe, can mimick Langerhans cell histiosytosis. When it extends beyond the centrilobular area to the edge of the secondary lobule, it may look as if it is cystic with walls. In patients with LCH, the pathologist may find LCH, but also areas of emphysema, respiratory bronchiolitis and even fibrosis. So these smoking-related diseases do not represent discrete entities. Alveolar proteinosis with crazy paving pattern
Alveolar proteinosis:
Alveolar proteinosis is a rare disease characterized by filling of the alveolar spaces with PAS positive material due to an abnormality in surfactant metabolism. The diagnosis is based on the suggestive HRCT pattern (crazy paving) and the characteristic features of BAL fluid (Broncho Alveolar Lavage) Key findings in alveolar proteinosis On the left a typical case of alveolar proteinosis with extensive thickening of interlobular and intra-lobular septa. This is caused by the fact that the proteinacious material, which is removed from the alveolar space by macrophages is transported to the interstitium and thus leads to thickening of septa. The crazy paving pattern is a rather non-specific finding. Many other diseases may present with this finding and are listed in the differential diagnosis.

TI-RADS - Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System:
Habib Ahmad and Aad van der Lugt
Radiology department of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam:
Up to 67% of the population evaluated with US will have an incidental thyroid nodule. The high prevalence of thyroid nodules combined with the generally indolent growth of thyroid cancer present a challenge for optimal patient care. The Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) of the American College of Radiology (ACR) was designed in 2017 with the intent to decrease biopsies of benign nodules and improve overall diagnostic accuracy.
TI-RADS categories:
Click to enlarge The five ultrasound features of thyroid nodules used in TI-RADS are: composition, echogenicity, shape, margin and punctate echogenic foci. Each item is given points. The points are added from all categories to determine the TI-RADS level, each with a recommendation. Nodules smaller than 5 mm do not need any follow-up, even if they are TI-RADS 5. 
This is because it is very unlikely that nodules smaller than 5 mm will become a clinical significant malignancy. The cutoff point of 2.5 cm for fine needle aspiration (FNA) in mildly suspicious TR3 lesions is based on studies showing that thyroid carcinomas don’t have a decreased survival until they reach this threshold value. The ACR-TIRADS category has been shown to have good correlation with the malignancy risk in large studies. The risk of malignancy is: This table is the horizantal version.

Cyst:
Here a typical cyst.
No further evaluation is needed.
Spongiform:
Spongiform nodules have a sponge-like appearance, with at least 50% cystic composition of tiny cystic parts. 
No further characterization is needed.
Mixed cystic/solid:
In mixed cystic/solid lesions the amount of cystic and solid parts is not important. This lesion gets 1 point for the mixed cystic/solid composition.
Solid lesions:
The lesion in A is almost completely solid. 
While there are small cystic parts, it is not considered a spongiform nodule, because the small cystic parts are far less than 50% of the total nodule. The lesion in B is completely solid. In solid nodules at least 95% of the nodule should be solid. 
This percentage should be an estimation, it is not needed to calculate this.

Comet tail artefact:
Echogenic foci is the only category where multiple options are possible and you have to choose all that apply.
Points will be added to the total score.
This means that when both punctate echogenic foci and rim calcifications are present, the TI-RADS points are 3 + 2 = 5 points 0 points is given for:
Macrocalcification:
This nodule has large macrocalcifications with acoustic shadowing. TI-RADS: 1 point.
Rim calcification:
Peripheral rim calcifications can be complete or incomplete. TI-RADS: 2 points.
Microcalcifications:
Punctate echogenic foci are also knows as microcalcifications. They are a strong predictor of malignancy and therefore get 3 points. The ACR lexicon further defined this category, because in the normal thyroid there also may be echogenic foci visible. 
Punctate echogenic should be called in the situation where they are obvious and only visible within the nodule. Small comet tail artifacts with a length less than 1mm are also included in this category. TI-RADS: 3 points.
Growth:
Growth of a nodule according to TI-RADS is also defined, and is in accordance with the ATA guidelines. There should be either: If there is no change in size for 5 years, the nodule can be considered as having a benign behavior, and further follow up is not needed. Comparison should be made with the oldest study available, and not (only) the last one. If there is interval growth without fulfillment of FNA criteria, the next follow-up should be after 1 year, regardless of the TI-RADS category.
Multiple Nodules:
When there are multiple nodules, there should be no more than 4 nodules classified. FNA is not recommended of more than 2 nodules. In the case of multiple nodules, the nodule fulfilling the TI-RADS FNA criteria should be sampled, which is not necessarily the dominant or largest nodule.
Overdiagnosis and Overtreatment:
Once a thyroid nodule is detected, the binary question remains, is it benign or malignant? 
Depending on the published series referenced, 6%–13% of thyroid nodules chosen for FNA will yield malignancy (1). The majority of thyroid cancers detected incidentally are papillary in origin.
Unlike its malevolent associate anaplastic thyroid cancer, which while accounting for only 1%–2% of thyroid cancers is responsible for over half the cancer deaths, papillary thyroid cancer is very benign. Since papillary is the dominant thyroid cancer and is well differentiated, the prognosis is remarkably good, with a reported 30-year survival of 95% (1).
As most of these cancers would never have caused symptoms during life, the increased diagnostic scrutiny is causing overdiagnosis.
Our research focus should be the discovery of the small percentage of thyroid cancers that are aggressive and alter life spans.

Bone tumors - Differential diagnosis:
Henk Jan van der Woude and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2010-04-10 / update 2022-03-17 In this article we will discuss a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions. The differential diagnosis mostly depends on the review of the conventional radiographs and the age of the patient. Abbreviations used: SBC = Simple Bone Cyst Systematic Approach
Systematic Approach:
The most important determinators in the analysis of a potential bone tumor are: It is important to realize that the plain radiograph is the most useful examination for differentiating these lesions.
CT and MRI are only helpful in selected cases. Here are links to other articles about bone tumors: Approach Most bone tumors are osteolytic. The most reliable indicator in determining whether these lesions are benign or malignant is the zone of transition between the lesion and the adjacent normal bone (1). Once we have decided whether a bone lesion is sclerotic or osteolytic and whether it has a well-defined or ill-defined margins, the next question should be: how old is the patient? Age is the most important clinical clue. Finally other clues need to be considered, such as a lesion's localization within the skeleton and within the bone, any periosteal reaction, cortical destruction, matrix calcifications, etc.
Age:
Age is the most important clinical clue in differentiating possible bone tumors.
There are many ways of splitting age groups, as can be seen in the table, where  the morphology of a bone lesion is combined with the age of the patient. Some prefer to divide patients into two age groups: younger or older than 30 years.
Most primary bone tumors are seen in patients under 30 years.
In patients over 30 years we must always include metastases and myeloma in the differential diagnosis. Notice the following:
Zone of transition:
In order to classify osteolytic lesions as well-defined or ill-defined, we need to look at the zone of transition between the lesion and the adjacent normal bone. The zone of transition is the most reliable indicator in determining whether an osteolytic lesion is benign or malignant (1). The zone of transition only applies to osteolytic lesions since sclerotic lesions usually have a narrow transition zone. Narrow zone of transition: NOF, SBC and ABC Small zone of transitionA small zone of transition results in a sharp, well-defined border and is a sign of slow growth.
A sclerotic border especially indicates poor biological activity. In patients
In patients > 30 years, and particularly > 40 years, despite benign radiographic features, a metastasis or plasmacytoma also have to be considered On the left three bone lesions with a narrow zone of transition. Based on the morphology and the age of the patients, these lesions are benign. Notice that in all three patients, the growth plates have not yet closed. Images Metastases and multiple myelomaIn patients > 40 years metastases and multiple myeloma are the most common bone tumors.
Metastases under the age of 40 are extremely rare, unless a patient is known to have a primary malignancy.
Metastases could be included in the differential diagnosis if a younger patient is known to have a malignancy, such as neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or retinoblastoma. Wide zone of transition indicates malignancy or infection or eosinophilic granuloma Wide zone of transition An ill-defined border with a broad zone of transition is a sign of aggressive growth (1). It is a feature of malignant bone tumors. There are two tumor-like lesions which may mimic a malignancy and have to be included in the differential diagnosis. These are infections and eosinophilic granuloma. Both of these entities may have an aggressive growth pattern. Images Infections and eosinophilic granuloma
Infections and eosinophilic granuloma are exceptional because they are benign lesions which can mimick a malignant bone tumor due to their aggressive biologic behavior. These lesions may have ill-defined margins, but cortical destruction and an aggressive type of periosteal reaction may also be seen.
Periosteal reaction:
A periosteal reaction is a non-specific reaction and will occur whenever the periosteum is irritated by a malignant tumor, benign tumor, infection or trauma. There are two patterns of periosteal reaction: a benign and an aggressive type. The benign type is seen in benign lesions such as benign tumors and following trauma. An aggressive type is seen in malignant tumors, but also in benign lesions with aggressive behavior, such as infections and eosinophilic granuloma. Fibrous dysplasia, Enchondroma, NOF and SBC are common bone lesions.
They will not present with a periosteal reaction unless there is a fracture.
If no fracture is present, these bone tumors can be excluded. Benign periosteal reaction Detecting a benign periosteal reaction may be very helpful, since malignant lesions never cause a benign periosteal reaction. A benign type of periosteal reaction is a thick, wavy and uniform callus formation resulting from chronic irritation. In the case of benign, slowly growing lesions, the periosteum has time to lay down thick new bone and remodel it into a more normal-appearing cortex. ImageBenign periosteal reaction in an osteoid osteoma.
Large arrow indicates solid periosteal reaction.
Small arrow indicates nidus. Aggressive periosteal reaction This type of periostitis is multilayered, lamellated or demonstrates bone formation perpendicular to the cortical bone. It may be spiculated and interrupted - sometimes there is a Codman's triangle. A Codman's triangle refers to an elevation of the periosteum away from the cortex, forming an angle where the elevated periosteum and bone come together. In aggressive periostitis the periosteum does not have time to consolidate. Aggressive periosteal reaction Aggressive periosteal reaction (2) Osteosarcoma (left) and Ewings sarcoma (right)
Cortical destruction:
Cortical destruction is a common finding, and not very useful in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. Complete destruction may be seen in high-grade malignant lesions, but also in locally aggressive benign lesions like EG and osteomyelitis. More uniform cortical bone destruction can be found in benign and low-grade malignant lesions. Endosteal scalloping of the cortical bone can be seen in benign lesions like Fybrous dysplasia and low-grade chondrosarcoma. Images Chondromyxoid fibroma (left), Giant cell tumor (right) BallooningBallooning is a special type of cortical destruction.
In ballooning the destruction of endosteal cortical bone and the addition of new bone on the outside occur at the same rate, resulting in expansion. This 'neocortex' can be smooth and uninterrupted, but may also be focally interrupted in more aggressive lesions like GCT. Images A benign, well-defined, expansile lesion with regular destruction of cortical bone and a peripheral layer of new bone.
2. Giant cell tumor A locally aggressive lesion with cortical destruction, expansion and a thin, interrupted peripheral layer of new bone. Notice the wide zone of transition towards the marrow cavity, which is a sign of aggressive behavior (red arrow). Ewing's sarcoma with permeative growth through the haversian channels accompanied by a large soft tissue mass Cortical destruction (3) In the group of malignant small round cell tumors which include Ewing's sarcoma, bone lymphoma and small cell osteosarcoma, the cortex may appear almost normal radiographically, while there is permeative growth throughout the Haversian channels. These tumors may be accompanied by a large soft tissue mass while there is almost no visible bone destruction. Images Location within the skeleton The location of a bone lesion within the skeleton can be a clue in the differential diagnosis. The illustration on the left shows the preferred locations of the most common bone tumors. In some locations, such as in the humerus or around the knee, almost all bone tumors may be found. Top five location of bone tumors in alphabethic order: Aneurysmal Bone Cyst - tibia, femur, fibula, spine, humerus
Adamantinoma - tibia shaft, mandible
Chondroblastoma - femur, humerus, tibia, tarsal bone (calc), patella
Chondromyxoid fibroma - tibia, femur, tarsal bone, phalanx foot, fibula
Chondrosarcoma - femur, rib, iliac bone, humerus, tibia
Chordoma - sacrococcygeal, spheno-occipital, cervical, lumbar, thoracic
Eosinophilic Granuloma -femur, skull, iliac bone, rib, vertebra
Enchondroma -phalanges of hands and feet, femur, humerus, metacarpals, rib
Ewing's sarcoma - femur, iliac bone, fibula, rib, tibia
Fibrous dysplasia - femur, tibia, rib, skull, humerus
Giant Cell Tumor - femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, distal radius
Hemangioma - spine, ribs, craniofacial bones, femur, tibia

Osteoid osteoma - femur, tibia, spine, tarsal bone, phalanx
Osteoblastoma - spine, tarsal bone (calc), femur, tibia, humerus
Osteochondroma - femur, humerus, tibia, fibula, pelvis
Osteomyelitis - femur, tibia, humerus, fibula, radius
Osteosarcoma - femur, tibia, humerus, fibula, iliac bone
Solitary Bone Cyst - proximal humerus, proximal femur, calcaneal bone, iliac bone
Location: epiphysis - metaphysis - diaphysis:
Only a few lesions are located in the epiphysis, so this could be an important finding. In young patients it is likely to be either a chondroblastoma or an infection. In patients over 20, a giant cell tumor has to be included in the differential diagnosis. In older patients a geode, i.e. degenerative subchondral bone cyst must be added to the differential diagnosis. Look carefully for any signs of arthrosis.
* Metaphysis NOF, SBC, CMF, Osteosarcoma, Chondrosarcoma, Enchondroma and infections.
* Diaphysis Ewing's sarcoma, SBC, ABC, Enchondroma, Fibrous dysplasia and Osteoblastoma. Differentiating between a diaphyseal and a metaphyseal location is not always possible. Many lesions can be located in both or move from the metaphysis to the diaphysis during growth. Large lesions tend to expand into both areas.
Location: centric - eccentric - juxtacortical:
SBC, eosinophilic granuloma, fibrous dysplasia, ABC and enchondroma are lesions that are located centrally within long bones.
* Eccentric in long bone Osteosarcoma, NOF, chondroblastoma, chondromyxoid fibroma, GCT and osteoblastoma are located eccentrically in long bones.
* Cortical Osteoid osteoma is located within the cortex and needs to be differentiated from osteomyelitis.
* Juxtacortical Osteochondroma. The cortex must extend into the stalk of the lesion. Parosteal osteosarcoma arises from the periosteum. Chondroid matrix
Matrix:
Calcifications or mineralization within a bone lesion may be an important clue in the differential diagnosis. There are two kinds of mineralization: Chondroid matrix Calcifications in chondroid tumors have many descriptions: rings-and-arcs, popcorn, focal stippled or flocculent. Images Osteoid matrix in Osteosarcoma (left) and Osteoid osteoma (right). Osteoid matrix Mineralization in osteoid tumors can be described as a trabecular ossification pattern in benign bone-forming lesions and as a cloud-like or ill-defined amorphous pattern in osteosarcomas. Sclerosis can also be reactive, e.g. in Ewing's sarcoma or lymphoma. Notice the aggressive, interrupted periosteal reaction (arrows).
* right Trabecular ossification pattern in osteoid osteoma. Notice osteolytic nidus (arrow). LEFT: Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia. RIGHT: Multiple osteolytic lesions in femurshaft
Polyostotic or multiple lesions:
Most bone tumors are solitary lesions. If there are multiple or polyostotic lesions, the differential diagnosis must be adjusted. *Polyostotic lesions NOF, fibrous dysplasia, multifocal osteomyelitis, enchondromas, osteochondoma, leukemia and metastatic Ewing' s sarcoma. Multiple enchondromas are seen in Morbus Ollier. Multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas are seen in Maffucci's syndrome.* Polyostotic lesions > 30 years Common: Metastases, multiple myeloma, multiple enchondromas. Less common: Fibrous dysplasia, Brown tumors of hyperparathyroidism, bone infarcts.

COVID-19 Differential Diagnosis:
This pictorial essay presents the differential diagnosis, mimickers and overlapping CT features of COVID-19. Performance of imaging in accurate prediction of disease depends on the likelihood of disease before the test was done. 
If regional COVID-19 prevalence is high, the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantial in a patient with fever, dyspnea and an abnormal CT. This likelihood changes if clinical signs are less suspicious, or if regional prevalence of COVID-19 is low.
Introduction:
Proven COVID-19 cases. Click on image to enlarge. During the peak of the first wave of COVID-19  the a priori probability that patients, who came to the hospital with dyspnoe, coughing and fever, actually had COVID-19 was high especially if they have an abnormal chest-CT. The images are all of patients with proven COVID-19 infection. The CT's were classified as CO-RADS 5, which indicates a very high probability of COVID-19. Chest CT can be helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients as an adjunct to PCR testing and serology. The CO-RADS classification uses features of COVID-19 on chest CT to indicate the likelihood of COVID-19 pulmonary involvement based on CT imaging (ref Prokop et al). Click here for more information about CO-RADS. The CO-RADS classification is accurate in the clinical setting of hospitalized patients with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and symptom duration of more than 2 days (ref Schalekamp et al). The performance of the CO-RADS classification decreases in patients without typical complaints of COVID-19 (ref), short symptom duration, and in patients with overlapping or pre-existing pulmonary disease. 
In those cases we have to consider other diseases in the differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of COVID-19 can be arbitrary divided into 3 subgroups: It is therefore important to take the appropriate clinical setting into account when applying CO-RADS, as a false positive CT-result may result in unnecessary treatment and isolation. In addition, framing bias should be avoided by taking the differential diagnoses of COVID-19 CT signs into consideration and to correlate these to the clinical history of the patient.
Groundglass mimickers:
Diffuse high density of the lung parenchyma can be caused by inadequate inspiration.
Inadequate inspiration:
Notice the presence of inward bowing of the posterior membrane, indicative of inadequate inspiration. Repeat examination showed normal parenchymal density (not shown). Mosaic attenutaion in a patient with bronchopathy with hypoxic vasconstriction.
Mosaic attenuation:
Mosaic attenuation of lung parenchyma based on multifocal hypoperfusion or hypoventilation can mimic ground-glass opacities, but is fundamentally distinct. Here, it is the low density pulmonary parenchyma that is abnormal.
It is caused by bronchopathy with hypoventilation and secondary hypoxic vasoconstriction. 
The relatively high density parenchyma is normal.
Differential diagnosis:
Centrally distributed groundglass with interlobular thickening in cardiogenic edema.
Pulmonary cardiogenic edema:
Pulmonary cardiogenic edema presents with bilateral ground-glass opacities reflecting extravascular fluid in the alveolar spaces. These ground-glass opacities are typically more centrally distributed with sparing of the peripheral parenchyma and do not fulfill the complete obligatory COVID-19 feature of location of ground glass close to the pleural surfaces. Gravity dependent groundglass with interlobular thickening in cardiogenic edema. In addition, distribution of edema can be gravity dependent, which can be appreciated on sagittal reconstructions. Pulmonary cardiogenic edema with centrally distributed groundglass, diffuse vascular enlargement, lymphnode enlargement and bronchial cuffing. Accompanying signs suggestive of cardiogenic edema:
Pulmonary infarctions:
Infarctions secondary to pulmonary emboli cause peripheral densities adjacent to the pleural surfaces. Although these densities in part consist of ground-glass opacities, especially in the early stage, infarctions are frequently more peripheral, triangular and dense. The images show: Alveloar hemorrhage in a patient with SLE.
Alveolar hemorrhage:
Bilateral and confluent airspace opacities caused by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage such as in e.g. systemic lupus erythomathosus on this image are distributed more along the bronchovascular bundles, and predominantly spare the peripheral pleural surfaces and costophrenic angles. These opacities should resolve in weeks if bleeding does not recur. The image shows alveloar hemorrhage with patchy groundglass along the bronchovascular bundles in a patient with secondary vasculitis in systemic lupus erythemathosus. In COVID-19 the groundglass is more peripheral and diffuse. More chronic or subacute hemorrhage causes crazy paving and fibrosis. In addition, clinical presentation including fever, cough and leukocytosis are less common in patients with alveolar hemorrhage, although the clinical presentation of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage remains highly variable. Only approximately 2/3 of patients have hemoptysis Peripheral groundglass in chronic eosinophilic pneumonia
Eosinophilic pneumonia:
Eosinophilic pneumonia can also present with fever andcough just like COVID-19.
On CT it presents like COVID-19 with peripheral ground-glass and consolidations, with or without a crazy paving pattern, which makes is very hard to distinghuish from COVID-19 on CT alone. Differentiation from COVID-19 is possible based on: Drug-induced pneunmonitis with groundglass, reticulation, crazy paving and consolidations (left), which resolved after drug withdrawal (right).
Drug-induced pneumonitis:
Drugs can cause CT patterns similar to confirmatory patterns of COVID-19, including ground glass, peripheral consolidations, crazy paving and organizing pneumonia patterns. The appropriate clinical setting of potentially pneumotoxic drugs and clear improvement after drug withdrawal (right) helps in suggesting this differential diagnosis. A list of pneumotoxic drugs and the findings on CT is found on www.pneumotox.com. Stationary groundglass and consolidations in the right lung after radiation therapy
Radiation pneumonitis:
Inflammatory and fibrotic changes associated with radiotherapy can cause peripheral ground-glass and consolidations in the area of the radiation therapy field. However, bilateral organizing pneumonia outside the radiation field can also occur, mimicking one of the confirmatory feature of COVID-19. Correlation with the radiotherapy field and stationary location of abnormalities over time can virtually always confirm radiation pneumonitis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis with head cheese sign
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis:
Ground glass opacities in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) are also bilateral, but show a more geographical pattern. In addition, HP has other features uncommon in COVID-19: The image shows typical bilateral groundglass opacities in hypersensitivity pneumonitis  with head cheese sign: a mixture of ground glass, normal density parenchyma and air trapping (circle). Peripheral, faint groundglass (arrows) in a patient with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia
NSIP:
Other interstitial lung diseases, such as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia can  present with peripheral ground glass opacities, which can simulate COVID-19. This patient had nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and presented on CT with faint ground glass resembling cellular and, to some extent, fibrotic interstitial disease. Differentiation from COVID-19: Groundglass and consolidations resembling extensive, bilateral non-mucinous invasive adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma in situ.
Adenocarcinoma:
Especially adenocarcinoma and its precursors can present with pure ground glass opacities with or without solid components, depending on the degree of invasiveness. Multifocal adenocarcinomain situcan present as bilateral ground glass opacities, which might look like COVID-19. Here, distribution is different from COVID-19, with a more geographical and diffuse distribution and no peripheral predominance. Alveolar proteinosis with diffuse crazy paving
Alveolar proteinosis:
Alveolar proteinosis is a rare condition, frequently associated with elevated lactate dehydrogenase, antibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and broncheoalveolar fluid findings typical for alveolar proteinosis. Crazy paving in alveolar proteinosis is much more diffuse than in COVID-19, with incidental lobular or geographic sparing, and is frequently disproportional with severity of complaints.
Overlapping diseases:
With overlapping diseases we mean diseases of the lung that have the exact pattern as COVID-19. 
Distinction can only be made with clinical parameters. Organizing pneumonia. LEFT typical peripheral and central peribronchiolar consolidations with central airway dilatation. RIGHT post treatment
Organizing pneumonia:
Patterns compatible with organizing pneumonia commonly occur in COVID-19. It is regarded as a confirmatory pattern, reflecting a later stage in the temporal evolution of the parenchymal abnormalities. This pattern in COVID-19 overlaps with organizing pneumonia due to other causes with typical peripheral and central peribronchiolar consolidations and central airway dilatation (figure). The lung abnormalities decreased after treatment with corticosteroids. Influenza pneumonia. bilateral groundglass with central distribution and centrilobular groundglass nodules.
Influenza pneumonia:
Viral pneumonias show overlapping features on CT. Influenza virus infection can result in bilateral ground-glass opacities, consolidations and crazy paving that appear similar to COVID-19. Typical features of influenza are: In addition, vessel thickening and upper lobe involvement seem to occur more frequently in the abnormal COVID-19 parenchyma than in other viral pneumonias. Bilateral groundglass in PCP in an immunocompromised patient.
Pneumocystis pneumonia:
Pneumocystis pneumonia also causes bilateral ground-glass and in later stages consolidations with or without crazy paving. However, this frequently occurs in a more central distribution than in COVID-19, and only in immunocompromised patients. PCP is furthermore associated with pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothoraces, although pneumothoraces and bullae also present in a small minority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. ARDS. Bilateral, in part gravity dependent groundglass with atelectasis, and pleural fluid in a patient who underwent a gastro-esophageal resection.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome:
Diffuse alveolar damage can also show peripheral ground-glass, consolidations and crazy paving, which can be similar to the alveolar damage in patients with COVID-19 (left), but also more gravity dependent reflecting permeability edema (right). ARDS can only occur in the appropriate setting, such as in a postoperative situation or in case of prolonged mechanical ventilation. However, ARDS can concomitantly occur with COVID-19 in ICU patients.

Characterisation of liver masses:
From a practical point of view, the approach to characterizing a focal liver lesion seen on CT begins with the determination of its density. If the lesion is of near water density, homogeneous, has sharp margins and shows no enhancement, then it is a cyst. If the lesion does enhance, then the next step is to determine whether the lesion could be a hemangioma, since this is by far the most common liver tumor. The enhancement should be peripheral and nodular, with the same density as the bloodpool in all phases. If it is not a cyst nor a hemangioma, then we further have to study the lesion. Based on the enhancement pattern, we divide masses into hypervascular and hypovascular lesions. Usually a combination of the enhancement pattern and gross pathologic features, like the presence of fat, blood, calcifications, cystic or fibrotic components, in combination with the clinical history will limit the differential diagnosis (figure).
Radiology department of the University of Chicago:
Publicationdate 2006-07-15 This article is based on a presentation given by Richard Baron and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Richard Baron is Chair of Radiology at the University of Chicago and well known for his work on hepatobiliary diseases. He has been president of the Society of Computed Body Tomography and Magnetic Resonance. In Part I a basic concept is given on how to detect and characterize livermasses with CT. In Part II the imaging features of the most common hepatic tumors are presented. Interactive cases are presented in the menubar to test your knowledge (Liver mass 1 and 2).
Detection of liver masses:
Small Hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic liver not visible on NECT (left), clearly visible in arterial phase (middle) and not visible in portal venous phase (right) The conspicuity of a liver lesion depends on the attenuation difference between the lesion and the normal liver. On a non enhanced CT-scan (NECT) liver tumors usually are not visible, because the inherent contrast between tumor tissue and the surrounding liver parenchyma is too low. Only a minority of tumors contain calcifications, cystic components, fat or hemorrage and will be detected on a NECT. So i.v. contrast is needed to increase the conspicuity of lesions. When we give i.v. contrast, it is important to understand, that there is a dual blood supply to the liver. Normal parenchyma is supplied for 80% by the portal vein and only for 20% by the hepatic artery, so it will enhance in the portal venous phase. All liver tumors however get 100% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery, so when they enhance it will be in the arterial phase. This difference in bloodsupply results in different enhancement patterns between liver tumors and normal liver parenchyma in the various phases of contrast enhancement (figure). Detection of a lesion depends on difference in attenuation between liver and lesion.LEFT: Arterial phase showing hypervascular FNHMIDDLE: Portal venous phase showing hypovascular metastasisRIGHT: equilibrium phase showing relatively dense cholangiocarcinoma In the arterial phase hypervascular tumors will enhance via the hepatic artery, when normal liver parenchyma does not yet enhances, because contrast is not yet in the portal venous system. These hypervascular tumors will be visible as hyperdense lesions in a relatively hypodense liver. However when the surrounding liver parenchyma starts to enhance in the portal venous phase, these hypervascular lesion may become obscured. In the portal venous phase hypovascular tumors are detected, when the normal liver parenchyma enhances maximally. These hypovascular tumors will be visible as hypodense lesions in a relatively hyperdense liver. In the equilibrium phase at about 10 minutes after contrast injection, tumors become visible, that either loose their contrast slower than normal liver, or wash out their contrast faster than normal liver parenchyma. These lesions will become either relatively hyperdense or hypodense to the normal liver. CT of the liver in the early arterial phase (left) and the late arterial pase (right).
Arterial phase imaging:
Optimal timing and speed of contrast injection are very important for good arterial phase imaging. Hypervascular tumors will enhance optimally at 35 sec after contrast injection (late arterial phase). This time is needed for the contrast to get from the peripheral vein to the hepatic artery and to diffuse into the liver tumor. On the left a patient who underwent two phases of arterial imaging at 18 and 35 seconds.
In the early arterial phase we nicely see the arteries, but we only see some irregular enhancement within the liver. In the late arterial phase we can clearly identify multiple tumor masses. Notice that in the late arterial phase there has to be some enhancement of the portal vein. The only time that an early arterial phase is needed is when you need an arteriogram, for instance as a roadmap for chemoembolization of a liver tumor. Patient with liver cirrhosis and multifocal HCC injected at 2.5ml/sec (left) and at 5ml/sec (right). Timing of scanning is important, but almost as important is speed of contrast injection. For arterial phase imaging the best results are with an injection rate of 5ml/sec. There are two reasons for this better enhancement: at 5ml/sec there will be more contrast delivered to the liver when you start scanning and this contrast arrives in a higher concentration. On the left a patient with cirrhosis examined after contrast injection at 2.5ml/sec and at 5ml/sec. At 5ml/sec there is far better contrast enhancement and better tumor detection. Hypovascular metastases seen as hypodense lesions in the late portal venous phase. Notice some rim enhancement of the more viable peripheral areas of the metastases.
Portal Venous phase:
Portal venous phase imaging works on the opposite idea. We image the liver when it is loaded with contrast through the portal vein to detect hypovascular tumors (figure). The best moment to start scanning is at about 75 seconds, so this is a late portal venous phase, because enhancement of the portal vein already starts at 35 sec in the late arterial phase. This late portal venous phase is also called the hepatic phase because there already must be enhancement of the hepatic veins.
If you do not seen enhancement of the hepatic veins, you are too early. If you only do portal venous imaging, for instance if you are only looking for hypovascular metastases in colorectal cancer, fast contrast injection is not needed, because in this phase the total amount of contrast is more important and 3ml/sec will be sufficient.
Equilibrium Phase:
The equilibrium phase is when contrast is moving away from the liver and the liver starts to decrease in density. This phase begins at about 3-4 minutes after contrast injection and imaging is best done at 10 minutes after contrast injection. This phase can be valuable if you're looking for: fast tumor washout in hypervascular tumors like HCC or retention of contrast in the blood pool as in hemangiomas or the retention of contrast in fibrous tissue in capsules (HCC) or scar tissue (FNH, Cholangioca). Small cholangiocarcinoma not visible in portal venous phase (left), but seen as relative hyperdense lesion in the delayed phase (right). Relative hyperdense lesions in the delayed phase Fibrous tissue that's well organized and dense is very slow to let iodine or gadolineum in. Once contrast gets in however, it is equally slow to get back out in the equilibrium phase. So when the normal liver parenchyma washes out, the fibrous components of a tumor will look brighter than the background liver tissue. Cholangiocarcinoma may have a fibrous stroma and in the delayed phase it may be the only time when you see the tumor (figure). HCC in a cirrhotic liver. Notice fast wash out in equilibrium phase compared to surrounding liver parenchyma. Relative hypodense lesions in the delayed phase On the left the importance of the delayed phase in a cirrhotic patient with an HCC is demonstrated. Notice that you do not see the tumor on the nonenhanced scan and also not in the portal venous phase. This is often the case and demonstrates the importance of the arterial phase. Now the issue at hand is in small enhancing lesions in a cirrhotic liver whether it is a benign lesion like a regenerating nodule or a HCC. In the delayed phase we see that the tumor is washed out more than the surrounding liver parenchyma. Benign lesions typically will not show this kind of wash out. For instance a FNH or adenoma will show fast enhancement in the arterial phase, become isodense in the portal venous phase, but it will stay isodense with liver in the equilibrium phase. These benign tumors do not have enough neoplastic neovascularity to have a fast wash out. Especially in cirrhotic patients you have to rely heavily on this delayed phase to differentiate benign little enhancing lesions from small HCC's. Hemangioma on NECT, late arterial, late portal venous and equilibrium phase. Notice that the attenuation of the hemangioma matches the bloodpool in every single phase (arrows).
Blood pool and Hemangioma:
Normally when we look at lesions filling with contrast, the density of these lesions is always compared to the density of the liver parenchyma. In hemangiomas however you should not compare the density of the lesion to the liver, but to the blood pool. This means that the areas of enhancement in a hemangioma should match the attenuation of the appropriate vessels (bloodpool) at all times.
So in the arterial phase the enhancing parts of the lesion must have almost the same attenuation value as the enhancing aorta , while in the portal venous phase it must match the enhancement of the portal vein. If it does not match the bloodpool in every single phase of contrast enhancement forget the diagnosis of a hemangioma. On the left a characteristic hemangioma.
Notice that on the NECT the density of the tumor is the same as the density of the vessels. In the arterial phase it is matching the bloodpool and the attenuation is almost the same as the aorta.
In the portal venous phase it matches the density of the portal vein.
In the equlibrium phase it has the same enhancement as the vessels. Eventually the lesion will become iso-attenuating to the liver, but only because the vessels become iso-attenuating with the liver.
It has nothing to do with the density of the liver parenchyma itself. So think of bloodpool rather than liver if you're thinking of a hemangioma.
Tailored CT protocol:
You have to adapt your protocol to the type of scanner, the speed of contrast injection and to the kind of patient that you are examining. If you have a single slice scanner, it will take about 20 seconds to scan the liver. For late arterial phase imaging 35 sec is the optimal time, so you start at about 25 seconds and end at about 45 seconds. However if you have a 64-slice scanner, you will be able to examine the whole liver in 4 seconds. So you start scanning at about 33 seconds, which is much later. In aterial phase imaging the time window is narrow, since you have only limited time before the surrounding liver will start to enhance and obscure a hypervascular lesion. For portal venous phase imaging it is different. Here you don't want to be too early, because you want to load the liver with contrast and it takes time for contrast to get from the portal vein into the liver parenchyma.
Besides you have more time, because the delayed or equilibrium phase starts at about 3-4 minutes. So you start at 75 seconds with whatever scanner you have.
Only when you inject with high speed at 5ml/sec you may start earlier at about 65-70 seconds. Use arterial phase imaging in the following situations:
Hypervascular lesions:
Arterially enhancing lesions are mostly benign lesions and include primary liver tumors as FNH, adenoma and small hemangiomas that fill rapidly with contrast. These benign tumors have to be differentiated from the most common hypervascular malignant liver tumor, which is HCC and metastases from hypervascular tumors like melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast, sarcoma and neuroendocrine tumors (islet cell tumors, carcinoid, pheochromocytoma). Four different tumors with enhancement in the late arterial phase. From left to right: HCC in cirrhotic liver; FNH with central scar in adolescent; adenoma in young woman on contraceptives and finally a hemangioma with typical enhancement in the other phases (not shown). Hypervascular lesions may look very similar in the arterial phase (figure). Differentiation is done by looking at the enhancement pattern in the other phases and additional gross pathologic features together with clinical findings. Hypervascular metastases will be considered in patients with a known primary tumor. In general HCC is considered when there is a setting of cirrhosis, while FNH is considered in young women and hepatic adenoma in patients on oral contraceptives, anabolic steroids or with a history of glycogen storage disease.
Hypovascular lesions:
Hypovascular liver tumors are more common than hypervascular tumors. Most hypovascular lesions are malignant and metastases are by far the most common. Although primary liver tumors are mostly hypervascular, there are exceptions. 10% of HCC is hypovascular. Cholangioca is hypovascular, but may show delayed enhancement (figure). Cholangiocarcinoma with relative hyperdense scar tissue in the equilibrium phase (arrow). On the left a hypovascular mass with irregular enhancement in the late arterial and late portal venous phase. This is a sign of malignancy. On the delayed images a relative dense structure is seen centrally, which looses its contrast slower compared to normal liver. This means that this tumor is mainly composed of fibrous tissue. 
The fibrous tissue has also retracted the liver capsule. These imaging findings are very suggestive of a cholangiocarcinoma.
Scar:
Liver lesions which may have a central scar are FNH, fibrolamellar carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hemangioma and hepatocellular carcinoma. On CT a scar is sometimes visible as a hypodense structure. On MR scar tissue is hypointense on both T1WI and T2WI due to intense fibrotic changes. An example is the central scar of fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) An exception to this rule is the central scar in FNH which is hyperintense on T2WI due to edema. T2WI can be very helpfull if there is a problem in differentiating FNH from FLC. Both on CT and MRI scar tissue will enhance in the delayed phase. FNH with central scar seen in NECT, portal venous phase and equilibrium phase. On the left a lesion with a typical central scar. It has a hypodense centre on the NECT. In the portal venous phase there is homogeneus enhancement of the lesion except for the scar. Enhancement of the fibrous tissue of the central scar is seen only on the delayed phase images. The combination of homogeneous enhancement and central scar is typical for the diagnosis of FNH. NECT and Arterial phase image showing hypodense capsule of HCC
Capsule:
Liver lesions which may have a capsule are Adenoma, HCC and cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. The most common tumor with a capsule is HCC. The capsule will not enhance in the arterial phase and even in the portal venous phase it will be hypodense, because the fibrous tissue enhances very slowly. A capsule is usually best seen in the delayed phase as a relative hyperdense structure. Capsule in Adenoma not seen in portal venous phase and well appreciated in delayed phase Adenoma frequently has a thin fibrous capsule seen in 30% of cases. It has a well defined contour and subcapsular feeding arteries. LEFT: Bright enhancing capsule of HCC in equilibrium phase.RIGHT: Pathologic specimen. On the left a different patient with HCC. Only in the equilibrium phase a relatively bright capsule was seen. The image on the left was taken 8 minutes after contrast injection. Notice that the tumor itself is relative hypodense in the equilibrium phase. So it has a fast wash out. NECT of a Fibrolamellar carcinoma with central calcifications
Calcifications:
Central calcifications are seen in: These calcifications are hyperdense on CT and hypointense on T1 and T2 MR images. In FLC these calcifications are located within the central scar as seen on the left. Low density area due to fat in Adenoma
Fat:
Fat within liver tumors is seen in: The case on the left shows an adenoma with fat depositions within the tumor. Hemorrhage within an adenoma.
Hemorrhage:
Hemorrhage in liver tumors is seen in: Hemorrhage is most commonly seen in adenomas. The case on the left shows a well circumscribed lesion with hemorrhage. At resection the lesion proved to be an adenoma.
Cystic components:
If a lesion has a near water density in the centre and does not show enhancement in the centre, we usually will call it a cystic lesion. You have to realize, that it still can be a tumor as in cystic metastases or metastases with central necrosis. Secondly you always have to add absces to the differential diagnosis. On the left a patient with hypovascular lesions with a low density, so it may be cystic i.e fluid containing. These lesions are multiple, but not spread out through the liver, so we describe them as clustered or satelite lesions. This is a typical finding which makes the lesions suspective for liver abcesses. This was a case of diverticulitis. The common route is through the portal vein as a result of abdominal infection. The bacteria enter the slow flow portal system, where they layer within the vessel and finally these bacteria 'fall down' into the dependent portion of the right lobe. CT and T2W MR-image of echinococcus cyst. On the left a typical case of a echinococcus cyst with 'daughter cysts' within the large cyst. Most cases of echinococcus cysts however are not that typical. If you look at the CT image on the left, the first impression might be that there are only simple cysts within the liver. However, if you look more carefully, you will notice that some of the hypodense lesions show vague rim enhancement. And although you might think that these could be cystic metastases, the US-findings clearly show, that these lesions are hyperechoic solid masses. So you have to be very carefull in calling a lesion cystic, because you might end up missing metastases or looking in the wrong file for a differential diagnosis. Hepatic and delayed phase in a patient with breast metastases causing retraction of liver capsule. Notice delayed enhancement of the fibrotic tissue (arrows)
Retraction of liver capsule:
Most liver tumors will present as a mass. Some tumors however have an infiltrative growth pattern with a lot of fibrous tissue and do not cause mass effect. As the fibrous stroma matures, the tissue will contract and cause retraction of the liver capsule (figure). Breast cancer metastases can be infiltrative. When they shrink they can cause multiple retractions. This will give a pseudo-cirrhosis appearance. Delayed phase image of a cholangiocarcinoma with relative dense fibrous stroma with retraction of liver capsule The most common tumor however to cause retraction is cholangiocarcinoma. The delayed image on the left shows a large cholangiocarcinoma with dense enhancing fibrous tissue and retraction of the liver capsule. Notice the resemblance with the case above. Another cause of local retraction is atrophy due to biliary obstruction or chronic portal venous obstruction. Hepatic and delayed phase in a patient with multifocal cholangiocarcinoma causing retraction of liver capsule. On the left another case of cholangiocarcinoma with multifocal lesions. Notice the retraction and the delayed enhancement of the fibrotic component of the tumor. LEFT: rim enhancement in metastasis. RIGHT: hemangioma with discontinuous nodular peripheral enhancement
Peripheral enhancement and progressive fill in:
Many will regard 'peripheral enhancement and progressive fill in' as a typical feature of hemangioma, but it is not. Peripheral rim enhancement is a typical feature of malignant lesions and only discontinuous nodular peripheral enhancement that matches bloodpool is a typical feature of hemangioma. Progressive fill in in a hemangioma (left), cholangiocarcinoma (middle) and metastases (right). Many lesions will show progressive fill in. In hemangiomas this progressive fill in must have the same density as the bloodpool. Many hypovascular metastases will show contrast diffusion into a lesion starting on the outside. Usually the center does not fill in. Cholangiocarcinomas will show progressive fill in because the fibrous centre will enhance slowly. You will see it enhance in the delayed phase (see part II) So if you want to make the diagnosis of a hemangioma you have to look at all the other phases to see if the enhancement matches the bloodpool.

Pancreatic cystic Lesions:

Diagnosis and management:
Marc Engelbrecht, Jennifer Bradshaw and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate update 21-3-20 Cystic pancreatic lesions are increasingly identified due to the widespread use of CT and MRI.
Certain pancreatic cysts represent premalignant lesions and may transform into mucin-producing adenocarcinoma. Although the overall risk of malignancy is very low, the presence of these pancreatic cysts is associated with a large degree of anxiety and further medical investigation due to concerns about malignancy. In larger cystic lesions it is usually possible to differentiate between benign serous cystadenomas and premalignant mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasms, but in small lesions characterization is often not possible. This means that many pancreatic cysts remain undetermined and guidelines are needed for follow up and management
Introduction:

Classification:
Pancreatic cysts can be categorized into the following groups:
Systematic Approach:
When a cystic pancreatic lesion is detected, the first step is to decide whether the lesion is most likely a pseudocyst or a cystic neoplasm. This scheme is a simplified roadmap for the differentiation of pancreatic cysts. LEFT: Pseudocyst. RIGHT: Cystic neoplasm. The left CT-image is of a patient with a history of pancreatitis. There are two unilocular or simple cysts. Notice also the retroperitoneal fat-stranding on the right. The most likely diagnosis is pseudocysts. The CT on the right shows a cyst in the pancreatic tail in a 36 year old woman, which was found incidentally with US. The cyst has a thick irregular rim and contains solid 'non-dependent' components. The most likely diagnosis is a cystic neoplasm. SCN with central scar seen on MRI
MRI versus CT:
CT will depict most pancreatic lesions, but is sometimes unable to depict the cystic component. MR with heavily weighted T2WI and MRCP will better demonstrate the cystic nature and the internal structure of the cyst and has the advantage of demonstrating the relationship of the cyst to the pancreatic duct as is seen in IPMN. The images show a serous cystic neoplasm (SCN) on a CT.
MRI better shows the central scar. Serous cystic neoplasm with central calcification. There are cases when CT can be helpful, since it better depicts a central calcification in SCN or peripheral calcification in a mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN). CT images of a mucinous cystic neoplasm with septations and peripheral calcifications. MRI shows dependant debris in pseudocyst MRI is usually of more diagnostic value than CT. 
MRI can show the cystic nature of a pancreatic fluid collection and its internal structure. 
The MRI shows a pancreatic fluid collection with dependent internal debris typical of walled off necrosis in necrotizing pancreatitis (7). MRI shows a lesion, which consists of multiple small cysts. This could be a serous cystic neoplasm or a branch-duct IPMN. The connection of the cystic lesion to the pancreatic duct indicates that this is a branch-duct IPMN.
Pseudocyst:
Pseudocyst Key findings: The CT demonstrates a large cyst in the upper abdomen in a patient who had an acute pancreatitis (Fig). Notice that there is also some ascites and pleural fluid. 
There is wall enhancement. Traumatic pseudocysts CT demonstrates two large cysts in a 45 year old woman, who had a trauma (fig). Notice some fat stranding in the retroperitoneal space (arrow). 
The imaging findings combined with the history make it very likely that these are traumatic pseudocysts. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Chronic pancreatitis with pseudocyst extending to the mediastinum Most pseudocyst occur in the peripancreatic region, but rarely they may extend to the mediastinum. Scroll through the images. This patient has a chronic pancreatitis. Notice the calcifications in the pancreatic head (curved arrow). There are multiple pseudocysts extending all the way to the mediastinum compressing the heart (red arrow).
Cystic Neoplasms - differential diagnosis:
The diagnosis of a cystic neoplasm should be considered when there is no history of pancreatitis or trauma. Morphological characteristics of a cystic neoplasm are: In the Table some discriminating features of cystic neoplasms.
In many cases however it is not possible to make a definitive diagnosis, because often the cyst will be too small. 
However it is important to diagnose a serous cystic neoplasm, since this is the only tumor with no malignant potential. When there are symptoms it is due to increasing size.
Age and gender:
Mucinous cystic neoplasm
MCN is exclusively seen in middle-aged women with a mean age of 47 years (8) .
Only 12 cases reported in males up to date (9). Serous cystic neoplasm 
SCN is also most commonly seen in women (75%) with a median age of 58 years (4). Solid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm 
SPEN is seen exclusively  in young women (88%), with a mean age of 29 years (10).
It is an uncommon solid tumor that may have cystic components. Hence the following rule:
Serous cystic neoplasm:
Figure 14. Serous cystic adenomas contain multiple small cysts resulting in a lobulated contour. Some have a central scar with calcifications. Key findings: Serous cystic neoplasm with cmultiple small cysts. Courtesy of Dr Allen, HPB surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY The pathology specimen shows multiple microcysts, which gives the tumor a lobulated appearance. A macrocystic serous cystic neoplasm is rare and, although benign, can be similar in appearance to the potentially malignant macrocystic mucinous cystic neoplasm. Serous cystic neoplasm with multiple small cysts. Courtesy of Dr Klimstra, pathology of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY, A characteristic feature of a serous cystic neoplasm is a central scar, sometimes with calcifications. Sometimes the microcystic component of this tumor is difficult to identify on CT. MR will better identify the internal architecture. MRI is also useful in determining if the cysts communicate with the pancreatic duct or not to differentiate this lesion from a branch-duct IPMN (see below). The pathology specimen shows a cystic tumor with multiple small cysts and a central scar. There are no calcifications. Serous Cystic Neoplasm CT-image of a 51 year old woman with a history of gallstones and abdominal pain. There is a hypodense lesion with central calcification in the head of the pancreas. The lesion has a lobulated contour. Continue with the MR. Serous Cystic Neoplasm (SCN) MRI better demonstrates the morphologic features of the lesion (fig). On T2WI the lesion is multicystic. Note the central low signal due to the central scar with calcifications. Although some of the cysts are rather large, this is still a characteristic appearance of a serous cystic adenoma (macrocystic form). Serous Cystic Neoplasm (SCN) Another example of a serous cystic neoplasm (Fig). The contrast-enhanced image on the right shows a hypodense lesion with central calcification in the body of the pancreas and subtle enhancement of septations Notice that on CT it is very difficult to appreciate the cystic nature of these lesions and you might think that you are dealing with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Serous Cystic Neoplasm (SCN) MRI will easily demonstrate the cystic nature of these lesions (fig).
The T2WI with fatsat nicely demonstrates a lobulated hyperintense lesion with central scar, which is characteristic of a SCN. Serous Cystic Neoplasm (SCN) It may be difficult to differentiate a serous microcystic adenoma from a branch-duct IPMN or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.
IPMN is always connected to the pancreatic duct, but in many cases it is difficult to see the connection. The image shows a T2WI of a 71 year old man with a history of weight loss and nondescript upper abdominal complaints.
This was initially thought to be a branch-duct IPMN, but turned out to be a SCN. Notice the central hypointensity.

Even though some of the cyst are larger than 2 cm, this presentation still is typical for a serous cystic neoplasm, because of the central scar, multilocular appearance and the lobulated contour.

Report and Management:
In the table a checklist of what to mention in the report and the relative and absolute indications for resection according to the European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms (2). Continue with the guidelines for management. The frequency of imaging follow-up depends on the presence of indications and fitness for surgery as can be seen in the table. Although these management guidelines apply to IPMN, in general practice we use these criteria also for pancreatic cysts of unknowm origin and suspected mucinous cystic neoplasms. However in suspected Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm a cyst size ≥ 4 cm is an absolute criterium for resection, whereas for IPMN it is a relative indication.
Imaging protocol:
The initial MRI should be done using a dedicated pancreatic protocol (tab).
A possible follow-up protocol for lesions < 3 cm may consist of coronal and axial T2 single shot sequences and T1 weighted precontrast and no post contrast. 
Possibly adding diffusion weighted images to minimize risk of missing a concomitant pancreatic carcinoma. We have chosen to follow-up cysts smaller than 3 cm without intravenous gadolinium with the rest of the sequences the same. If we find a possible new nodule we would return the patient and repeat the MR scan with IV gadolinium to evaluate for enhancement.

Cystic Lung Cancer:
Onno Mets and Robin Smithuis
Amsterdam University Medical Center, Vancouver General Hospital and Alrijne hospital Leiderdorp:
Publicationdate 17-03-2020 Cystic primary lung cancer is increasingly being recognized as a unique imaging morphology.
In this article we will discuss the imaging features and management Press ctrl+for larger images and text on a PC or ⌘+ on a Mac.
Most images can be enlarged separately by clicking on them.
Introduction:
CT imaging morphology of pulmonary nodules. Cystic primary lung cancer is often missed or misinterpreted, which is most likely due to their unique imaging appearance, showing overlap with benign entities such as infection. The appearance is different from solid and subsolid nodules, which are the more commonly known CT appearances of lung cancer (fig).
Terminology:
Examples of cystic lung cancer with an exophytic (left panel) and endophytic (right panel) solid component. A cystic pulmonary nodule may be defined as solid and/or ground glass attenuation in relation to a well-defined parenchymal air space. A cystic nodule may demonstrate: Examples of cystic lung cancer The images show more examples of cystic lung cancer with a thin (left panel) and thick (middle panel) irregular wall thickening, and a more complex appearance with extensive ground glass and multilocular air spaces (right panel). Several classification systems have been proposed based on this imaging morphology [1,2]. Clinical implications of any subclassification are yet unknown and therefore they are of limited value for routine radiology care. Cystic lung cancer with increase of the solid component over a 2-year scan interval. Solidification Solidification is the opposite of cavitation.
Solidification is a process that is often demonstrated by cystic lung cancers – where the solid tissue component increases over time and may eventually even obliterate previous ground glass and/or cystic air spaces completely, leading to a solid mass. Cystic lung cancer demonstrating ‘solidification’ Here another example of a cystic lung cancer demonstrating ‘solidification’ from a baseline precursor lesion with subtle irregular wall thickening into a solid mass at time of diagnosis. It is important to note that cavitation – which is the process of central lucency formation due to expulsion of necrotic tumour content – can only be assessed on serial CT.
Although very often encountered in reports of single time point CT, this term should be applied with caution.
It may insinuate a differential diagnosis of infection or other disease that steers away from the correct diagnosis of a primary lung cancer that is most likely an adenocarcinoma [3,4]. The images show another example of a cystic lung cancer demonstrating ‘solidification’.
Daily practice:
Patient with a T1c adenocarcinoma in the left upper lobe (left panel). Growing synchronous cystic lesion in the right lower lobe (right panel) that represented an unrelated second primary adenocarcinoma on histopathology. In daily practice The prevalence of cystic lung cancer is not well established and ranges between 0.5% and 12%, depending on study population selection [1,5,6].
Presumably, cystic lung cancer morphology is not uncommon at all [4]. Several recognized associations are of specific importance to radiologists during daily CT reporting, as increased awareness and active search should be demonstrated in this population. First, it has been recognized that cystic lung cancer regularly represents a secondary primary malignancy, either metachronous or synchronous with the first lung cancer (figure). Second, a high percentage of patients with cystic lung cancer are (ex-)smokers and have pre-existent emphysema, although cystic lung cancers undeniably do occur in otherwise normal lungs. Third, cystic lung cancers tend to occur in the periphery of the lung, which makes it a relevant entity to all radiologists who image part of the lungs, specifically neuro, abdominal and ER radiologists. Cystic squamous cell carcinoma. These images are of a patient with a left lower lobe cystic squamous cell carcinoma (left panel), who developed a right lower lobe cystic lesion (right panel) and subcarinal lymphadenopathy 3 years into follow-up. Although initially considered contralateral metastatic disease, recommended tissue analysis showed an unrelated second primary squamous cell carcinoma on histopathology.
Histopathology:
Check-valve mechanism due to tumor cells (in red) in terminal airway Cystic lung cancers are predominantly adenocarcinomas in about 80% of cases, with squamous cell carcinomas as the second most common subtype. 
A rare number of other tumour types like adenosquamous, neuroendocrine and lymphoma have been reported. Multiple underlying histopathologic substrates (eg. focal tumour proliferation, fibrosis, lepidic tumour growth along alveolar walls, emphysema) relate to the imaging features of cystic lung cancer and are responsible for either the solid component, septations, ground glass, and cystic air spaces [1,5,7]. The most widely quoted mechanism of air space formation is “check-valve” ventilation. The air can enter in inspiration but cannot return during expiration due to partial obstruction of the terminal airway proximal to the cystic air space due to tumour cells and fibrosis. This leads to development, persistency and enlargement of the cystic air space. courtesy of JC English Radiologic-histopathologic correlation of a squamous cell carcinoma.
A cystic air space lined is by tumour cells (asterisk) most likely represents a dilated distal airway. 
Check-valve ventilation due to more proximal airway narrowing by malignant cells and/or fibrosis is presumed. A juxtaposed pulmonary artery with surrounding malignant cells projects into the lumen (arrow).
Natural history:
Example showing transition from pure ground glass (left panel) to cystic lung cancer morphology (right panel). Cystic lung cancers are progressive lesions, inherent to their malignant aetiology. 
Although they may be aggressive, many are rather slow-growing adenocarcinomas. CT morphology may remain cystic over time, however, when the independent contribution of the underlying histopathologic substrates changes, lesion morphology may change over time. Example showing transition from cystic (left and middle panel) to part-solid lung cancer morphology (right panel). Cystic nodules will either show increase of solid components, develop additional ground glass and cystic components and demonstrate increase in total lesion size. It has retrospectively been shown that cystic lung cancers can both develop from small subsolid precursor lesions, as well as change from cystic precursor lesions into solid or subsolid cancers at time of diagnosis. Lung cancer morphology is thus fluent and cystic components may be temporary. This example shows transition from part-solid (left panel), to temporarily cystic (middle panel), to solid lung cancer morphology (right panel).
Mimickers:
There are multiple benign diseases that may look like cystic primary lung cancer, including [3,4,8]: Previous imaging (including non-chest imaging), clinical information and lab values, as well as past medical history are often helpful to differentiate a suspected primary lung cancer from other aetiology. 
In the absence of an overt underlying benign cause, any new lung cyst or cystic air space with associated subsolid component should raise the suspicion for a primary lung malignancy and managed accordingly with CT surveillance or biopsy, if appropriate. Mimickers of cystic lung cancer: Persistent loculated air space - left panel, rheumatoid nodule - middle panel and a scar - right panel. The images are examples of mimickers of cystic lung cancer morphology. Absolute malignancy risk of solitary cystic nodules is currently unknown, as that would require prospective surveillance of all benign and malignant cystic nodules in a given cohort.
Nodule management:
Multiloculated cystic lesion (left panel) interpreted as “non-specific”, despite a 6-month follow-up CT (for another reason) showed mild increase of ground glass, cystic air spaces and overall lesion size. The next CT was obtained for chest pain 2 years later, showing a large mass invading the chest wall (right panel). Patient died from metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The currently available screening (Lung-RADS) or clinical (BTS and Fleischner) nodule management guidelines do not include cystic lung nodules. 
Although no uniform guidance is provided and optimal surveillance strategy is unknown, it is crucial that these lesions are not lost to follow-up in order to prevent diagnostic delay and associated patient burden. Pending potential incorporation into future guideline versions, the following strategy might be reasonable when a suspicious cystic nodule is encountered: The images show a small cystic precursor lesion (left panel) initially interpreted as “thin-walled cavity, likely infection”. The next CT was obtained for cough 4 years later, showing a T4 squamous cell carcinoma (right panel). Patient was alive 2 years after resection and systemic treatment.
Staging:
Possible overestimation of tumour burden due to inclusion of the cystic air space component in the total lesion size, when measured according to TNM 8th edition (stippled lines). The solid line (left panel) may better represent the invasive tumour component and associated prognosis. Despite the unique morphology of cystic lung cancer, staging is performed according to the ‘standard’ TNM 8th edition, which stages patient groups based on their prognosis. However, measuring complex cystic lesions on CT may be prone to variability and one may posit that total lesion size (including the sometimes large cystic component) overestimates the total tumour burden, as it is more likely that the invasive solid component relates to the prognosis. Future consideration of an adjusted classification might be reasonable, as is available for subsolid pulmonary malignancies [9].

TLICS Classification of fractures:

Thoraco-Lumbar Injury Classification and Severity score:
by Clark West, Stefan Roosendaal, Joost Bot and Frank Smithuis
Department of Radiology and Regional Spinal Cord Injury Center of the Delaware Valley, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia and the Radiology Department of the Free University Medical Center and the Academical Medical Center, Amsterdam:
Publicationdate 2015-05-01 The Thoraco-Lumbar Injury Classification and Severity score (TLICS) is a classification system for thoracolumbar spine injuries, designed to assist in clinical management. Unlike other classifications, the TLICS is an easy scoring system that depicts the features important in predicting spinal stability, future deformity, and progressive neurologic compromise. TLICS also facilitates appropriate treatment recommendations.
Introduction:
Most classification systems of spine injuries are based on injury mechanisms and describe how the injury occurred. This is all based on the premise that a fracture caused by forward flexion should be treated by undoing the flexion by positioning the patient in an extension brace, or by surgical intervention correcting the spinal column in extension. Some of the injuries thought to be due to extension mechanisms, however, turn out to be due to flexion and vice versa. These descriptions may thus be misleading. A problem with classifications such as the AO-classification is that they are usually complex, leading to high inter-reader variability. Using the popular Denis three-column classification may lead to another situation since it uses the terms stable and unstable. In many cases, however, there is no good correlation with the necessity for surgery. Furthermore, the word stability itself is ambiguous and may refer to direct osseous stability; it may refer to neurological stability and finally, to long-term (ligamentous) stability. Both of these commonly used systems fail to systematically take into account the neurological status of the patient and the indication for MRI to determine the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex. For these reasons the Spine Trauma Study Group introduced in 2005 the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Scale (1), with intention to be a reliable, ease-to-use tool to facilitate clinical decision making and as a practical alternative to cumbersome classification systems already in use. The TLICS consists of three independent parameters: A parameter can be scored 0-4 points and the total score is the sum of these parameters with a maximum of 10 points. The total score predicts the need for surgery as is shown in the TLICS algorithm. A total of more than 4 points indicates surgical treatment. A compression fracture gets 1 point. When it is complicated by a burst, it gets an additional 1 point, resulting in 2 points. The integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex plays an important role in the TLICS. Sometimes it will be possible to determine PLC injury on CT, but MRI may be necessary. When there are several fractures, each level has to be scored separately. The level with the highest TLICS score will determine the type of treatment. Morphology and PLC are scored separately. For example, in a translation/rotation injury, the PLC is always involved, making a total of 3+3=6 points. When there is a distraction on the posterior side, the PLC is always involved, making a total of 4+3=7 points. In case of a distraction on the anterior side, however, the PLC may or may not be involved, i.e. it will be either 4 or 4+3= 7 points.
Morphology:

Posterior Ligamentous Complex:
The PLC serves as a posterior "tension band" of the spinal column and plays an important role in the stability of the spine (3). A torn PLC has a tendency not to heal and can lead to progressive kyphosis and collapse. The PLC is composed of the supraspinous ligaments, interspinous ligaments, articular facet capsules, and ligamenta flava (figure). The supraspinous ligament is a strong, cordlike ligament which connects the tips of the spinous processes from C7 to the sacrum. The interspinous ligaments are weak, thin, membranous structures connecting the adjacent spinous processes. The contractile force of the ligamenta flava presses the vertebrae together and keeps them aligned. The facet joints act against rotational forces. CT features of PLC pathology are: When the PLC is definitely injured on CT, it can already be scored as 3. Since the integrity of the PLC depends mostly on ligamentous structures, MR is sometimes needed to adequately diagnose pathology of the PLC, especially when there is no dislocation or disruption on CT. MRI features of PLC pathology are: MRI has a tendency to overdiagnose PLC injury (4). In some cases it can be difficult to decide whether there is a burst fracture with a torn PLC or distraction with a torn PLC and a compression fracture (figure). You have to decide what you think is the main issue: the collapse of the vertebral body or the distraction. Since in both cases the TLICS score based on imaging will be high, there is usually an indication for surgical treatment. TLICS score In case of multiple fractures, you have to score each level separately. The level with the highest TLICS score usually will be decisive for the therapy of choice.
Neurological status:
The third category is the neurological status as determined by the neurologist or spine surgeon. The role of the radiologist is to report the following: One of the key points here is that an incomplete cord lesion will likely benefit more from surgery than a complete lesion; therefore a complete cord injury is scored as only 2 points, while an incomplete cord injury gets 3 points.
Modifiers:
Modifiers are other factors which can affect the decision of appropriate treatment: Sternum fracture Sternum fracture The image shows a vertebral fracture with a transverse fracture of the spinous process, but also a fracture of the sternum. Analogous to the 3-column classification of Denis, some investigators consider the sternum as the fourth column in upper thoracic spinal fractures and recognize it as an independent variable in the assessment and treatment of these patients (5). Rigid spine Patients with a rigid spine (such as in ankylosing spondylitis, DISH and rheumatoid arthritis) are more susceptible to spinal fractures, even after minimal trauma (6). Ossification of the spinal ligaments and calcification of the annulus fibrosus alter the biomechanics of the spine, creating long lever arms and limiting the ability to absorb even minor impacts. The bone is usually very osteoporotic. The images are of a patient with a typical bamboo spine as a result of ankylosing spondylitis. After a fall on his back no fracture was seen on the x-rays. However the CT shows a thin fracture line through the anterior side of the vertebral body and also through the spinous process. Continue with the MR-images. Enable Scroll

Simple compression:
A simple compression fracture is the most common form of injury and is seen in 90% of cases. It is either loss of height of the anterior part of the vertebral body or disruption of the vertebral endplate. The posterior cortex of the vertebral body has to be intact and this feature differentiates a simple compression fracture from the more severe burst fracture. The posterior cortex may bulge slightly posteriorly in a simple compression fracture. As long as there is no free fragment with posterior displacement, it is a wedge compression fracture and not a burst fracture. The images show a compression fracture. All we see is a cortical disruption in the upper anterior wall of the vertebral body and slight loss of height ventrally. The posterior vertebral cortex is intact. The sagittal reformatted image also shows the cortical disruption. Notice that on a 2.5mm axial slice you can miss these fractures. You have to look at the thin slices to detect such a subtle fracture. Enable Scroll

This density does not mean that it involves an older fracture that is already healing with sclerosis. This is merely a sign of trabecular impaction in an acute fracture. It is very common to see more fractures on imaging with CT and MRI than on the radiographs. In this case the CT shows 2 fractures and the MRI shows 3 fractures. Pitfalls in diagnosing a compression fracture are: The images show two cases of osteochondrosis. On the right with kyphosis.
Burst fracture:
This is the severe variant of a compression fracture with higher risk of neurologic deficits. The name is derived from the typical fracture following a fall from height and landing on the feet. A burst fracture gets 2 points for morphology in the TLICS. This means that a patient can be treated non-surgically. In the absence of a neurologic deficit, PLC integrity should be confirmed at MR imaging, especially if conservative management of a burst fracture is planned (3). In the Denis classification a burst fracture is classified as a two-column injury, calling it unstable and requiring surgical stabilization. Subsequent modifications of the Denis classification have recognized that with an intact posterior ligamentous complex (PLC), two-column unstable injuries can be successfully treated non-surgically (3).

fracture of vertebral body and
posterior element A sagittal fracture of the vertebral body and a sagittal posterior element fracture is seen in respectively 90% and 85% of cases of burst fracture cases. Here are four examples. In the Denis classification this would be a three column fracture -anterior/middle/posterior - indicating a very unstable fracture. In the TLICS classification however this is a burst fracture, i.e. 2 points for morphology. The treatment will depend on the PLC integrity and the neurological status. Widening of the interpedicular distance Widening of the interpedicular distance, often a result of the sagittal fracture, is seen in 80% of burst fractures. The lateral view shows the typical features of a burst fracture. On the AP-view notice the subtle widening of the interpedicular distance compared to the levels above and below. The axial CT and MRI in the same patient show the displaced fragment pressing on the thecal sac. On the sagittal CT and MRI there are no signs of posterior ligamentous injury. The anterior longitudinal ligament is disrupted. The right facet joint looks a bit widened on the CT and there is some fluid in the joint on the MRI. If there was a lot of fluid in the joint, we should call this indeterminate. In this case we are not sure. Enable Scroll

Translation - Rotation:
This type of fracture includes all fractures that are the result of displacement in the horizontal plane: side-to-side motion, either left-to-right or anterior-to-posterior or side-to-side rotary motion of one vertebral body with respect to another. Often unilateral or bilateral facet dislocation is seen in rotational fractures. It is a severe type of injury, which always involves the PLC. In the TLICS this means 3 points for the morphology and 3 points for the PLC, which makes a total of 6 points indicating the need for surgical stabilization. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll On the axial images we see: These are typical findings in translation-rotation fractures. So we should call this a translation fracture with anterior displacement.
Distraction:
A distraction injury is separation or pulling apart of two adjacent vertebrae. It is a severe injury since there is a high chance of cord injury when its osseous and ligamentous supporting structures are pulled apart. A distraction injury on the posterior side can lead to a compression fracture on the anterior side. So be sure not to underestimate the injury by only looking at the compression fracture and overlooking the distraction injury. In some cases it is difficult to decide whether you are dealing with distraction combined with a compression fracture or with a compression fracture with PLC-injury. If the distraction is the main feature, then the morphology is distraction, i.e. 4 points. In these cases the PLC is always involved, resulting in a total of 7 points for the TLICS-score. If compression is the main feature, then the morphology is burst, i.e. 2 points combined with the PLC injury making a total of 5 points. In both cases the patient is a surgical candidate.

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images. What are the findings? The findings are: In this case some would call this a burst fracture with PLC-injury i.e. 2+3 points. However the distraction is the most important finding, i.e. distraction and PLC injury, i.e. 4+3 points. So here is a typical case of distraction. The primary feature is pulling apart. There is not much else happening here. The disc space is markedly widened about four times the normal level. The facet joints are separated on both sides. There is a spinous process fracture, which is not a key element but a frequently associated injury. Continue with the MR. The MRI shows exactly the same things. Frequently when you have a good CT, you have most of the anatomic information. The MRI also shows disruption of the ligamentum flavum and a partial disruption of the interspinous ligament. TLICS score: This patient is at high risk of developing a spinal cord injury. Here a fracture that just looks like another compression fracture on the lateral view. At first glance the AP-view doesn't look very odd. That is until we zoom in and look at the distance between the spinous processes. Now when you look carefully at the lateral view, you will notice that the facets are separated. The MRI tells us the whole story. You can see the edema related to the fracture of the vertebral body and the massive edema in the paraspinous muscles. There is major disruption of the PLC of both the ligamenta flava and the interspinous ligament. TLICS: distraction injury + PLC disruption. This is an interesting case since non-surgical management was initially attempted in this patient. However when we classify according to the TLICS-score, we give 4 points for the morphology and 3 points for the PLC. Assuming the neurological exam was normal, this patient would still get 7 points. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, conservative management failed with near-dislocation. Finally a posterior spondylodesis was performed. Here's another example. You could call these compression fractures. There is loss of height with a dense band of impaction and there is an anterosuperior corner fracture on both levels. But look at the spinous processes. One of the spinous processes is in two pieces and the two pieces are widely separated. So this is a distraction fracture, also known as Chance fracture. Now when you describe such a fracture the first word in your report should be distraction, i.e. morphology: 4 points. This next case has a great teaching point. There is widening between the spinous processes. But there are also little pieces ofbone, that have avulsed at least 10mm away. At first we thought that little pieces of bone didn't matter, but they may be the most important sign of a major injury on a CT-scan. The fact that these little pieces of bone have been so severely displaced means there has to be a major injury. Now in this case there are lots of other things going on, but sometimes these little pieces of bone are all you get. If you look back, see how nicely it correlates with the PLC-injury on the MRI. The teaching point is: pay careful attention to little pieces of bone. Patients with a rigid spine are more at risk for translation or distraction. Here is a patient with distraction on the anterior side. Notice the rigid spine and how easily this major injury can be overlooked. This patient had a motorcycle accident. The MRI demonstrates rupture of the flava ligaments, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments as well as fracture of the posterior elements and compression of the vertebral body. A posterior spondylodesis was performed. Here another distraction injury. At surgery the rupture of the supraspinous ligament was confirmed (red and black arrows)

Non-traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage:
Amber Bucker, Henriette Westerlaan, Aryan Mazuri, Maarten Uyttenboogaart and Robin Smithuis
University Medical Center Groningen and Alrijne Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Any type of bleeding inside the skull or brain is a medical emergency.
The most common causes of hemorrhage are trauma, haemorrhagic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm.
Complications are increased intracerebral pressure as a result of the hemorrhage itself, surrounding edema or hydrocephalus due to obstruction of CSF. In this article we will discuss non-traumatic hemorrhages. They will be discussed by their location, because that is frequently the clue to the differential diagnosis.
Then we will discuss further imaging to get to a specific diagnosis.
Finally specific diseases that present with intracerebral hemorrhages will be presented in more detail. Press ctrl+ for larger images and text on a PC or ⌘+ on a Mac.
Most images can be enlarged by clicking on them.
Localization of hemorrhage:
Knowing the location of a hemorrhage is often the key to the differential diagnosis especially in non-traumatic bleeding. Extra-axial hemorrhage -Intracranial extracerebral Intra-axial hemorrhage- intracerebral 85% of non-traumatic hemorrhages are seen in patients with hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). In hypertension the hemorrhages are typically in a central position in the basal ganglia, pons, thalamus and cerebellum, while in CAA they are typically more in a peripheral location - deep in the frontal, parietal or temporal lobes - also called lobar hemorrhages. The differential diagnosis in a patient with an intracerebral hemorrhage however is much larger and also includes: Right lower image is venous infarction due to sinus thrombosis (yellow arrows)
Lobar hemorrhage:
Lobar hemorrhages are located in the periphery of the cerebral lobes unlike hypertensive bleeding which usually is located more centrally. The most common cause especially in elderly is cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but also hypertension because of its high prevalence. Other causes: Here some examples of lobar hemorrhages. Bleeding into the ventricular system in lobar hemorrhage is not as common as in hypertensive hemorrhage because of the more periferal location. Only when they are very large, they can cause bleeding into the ventricular system (fig). This patient died the next day.
No definitive diagnosis was made, but it was assumed that this was a case of CAA.
Basal ganglia:
Hemorrhage in the basal ganglia is typically seen in hypertension.
Hypertensive hemorrhage typically occurs in elderly patients and is usually in a central location.
This differentiates hypertensive bleeding from hemorrhage in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) which are more peripheral in location, although overlap can occur. The images show a typical hypertensive hemorrhage in the putamen, which is the largest and most lateral part of the basal ganglia.
Continue with the follow up images... On a follow up scan only parenchymal loss is seen in the putamen where the hemorrhage was located (arrow). The putamen is vascularized by the lenticulostriate arteries (LSa). The LSa are small diameter end vessels that originate at a right angle from the artery of Charcot without the gradual stepdown in size that occurs in the distal cortical vessels. Their internal pressure may be very high and for this reason the LSa are particularly susceptible to damage from hypertension, the formation of small aneurysms and rupture (3) (ref). The first three images show a large hematoma in the basal ganglia on the right with massive edema. The follow up image one year later shows  linear cavitation due to tissue loss (arrow) and hypodensity of the basal ganglia as a result of  gliosis. Hemorrhage in the head of the caudate nucleus with extension into the ventricular system Caudate nucleus The images show a hemorrhage in the basal ganglia in a patient with longstanding hypertension.
It is located in the head of the caudate nucleus. The head of the caudate nucleus receives its blood supply from Heubner’s artery and the lenticulostriate arteries,.
A rupture in these arteries causes parenchymal hemorrhage. The presence of an intraventricular haematoma is considered a poor prognostic factor due to the obstruction to CSF with hydrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure.
Thalamus:
Bleeding in the thalamus is typically seen in hypertension. This patient presented with hydrocephalus due to an intraventricular hemorrhage (left image). 
Note the very small hyperdensity in the left thalamus, which is the origin of the hemorrhage. Follow-up one day later (right image). 
The patient  underwent surgery with placement of a ventricle drain to treat the hydrocephalus. 
Note the hypodense thalamus on the left side with the persistent medially located hyperdense focus.
Cerebellar:
This patient presented with a cerebellar hemorrhage.
The gradient echo-images show multiple microbleeds. This can be the result of long standing hypertension due to the central location of some of the microbleeds.
Subarachnoid:
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and the pia mater. The most common cause is trauma. Non-traumatic SAH is usually the result of aneurysmal rupture with spread of blood into the subarchnoidal cisterns (fig). The first choice of imaging modality in a patient with a clinical suspicion of SAH is a non-enhanced CT scan (NECT). NECT is positive for SAH in 98% within 12  hours of onset. 
If the suspicion is strong, but the CT is negative, a lumbar puncture is performed to detect blood in the CSF. The images show a subarachnoid hemorrhage as a result of rupture of an aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery (arrow). Subarachnoid hemorrhage is discussed in more detail here.
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA):

Disable Scroll Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a disorder characterized by deposits of amyloid in the walls of the small leptomeningeal and cortical arteries resulting in leukencephalopathy and hemorrhage.
The hemorrhages can be divided in macrobleeds or lobar hemorrhages, microbleeds and subarachnoid hemorrhages that result in cortical superficial siderosis.
It is not associated with systemic amyloidosis. The major symptoms are neurologic deficits, dementia and epilepsia.
The epilepsia is caused by the hemosiderin deposits near the cortex of the brain. The major risk factor is increasing age. These small hemorrhages are also called microbleeds.
Notice how numerous these small hemorrhages are and primarily located in the perifery of the brain.
This patient presented with a cerebellar hematoma. Continue with the T1W-image... The T1W-image shows a hyperintense hemorrhage (arrow). Hypertensive intracranial haemorrhage together with CAA make up 80% of the causes of intraparenchymal hematomas. 
Think of CAA if you see multiple peripheral or lobar haemorrhages in an elderly patient. Dutch type of hereditary CAA The Dutch type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common form. 
Stroke is frequently the first sign of the Dutch type and is fatal in about one third of people who have this condition. 
Survivors often develop dementia and have recurrent strokes. 
About half of individuals with the Dutch type who have one or more strokes will have recurrent seizures. Cortical superficial siderosis in CAA CAA-related bleeds include: In superficial siderosis the proximity to the cortical surface appears to be the trigger for transient focal neurologic symptoms or amyloid spells. CAA patients with widespread cortical superficial siderosis  have a far greater chance for recurrent hemorrhage compared to patients without cSS (ref). Lobar hemorrhage in Cerebral Amyloid angiopathy (CAA) This patient with CAA presented with a large lobar hematoma in the right temporal lobe.
Notice the superficial siderosis (arrow). This patient with CAA has microbleeds, superficial siderosis and multiple infarcts. Notice the hemorrhage in the pons (yellow arrow).
There is superficial siderosis in the left occipital region.
The DWI shows infarction in left occipital lobe and reight frontal lobe (with some artifacts).
Subarachnoid hemorrhage:

Aneurysmal rupture:
As mentioned before a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and the pia mater. The most common cause is trauma. Non-traumatic SAH is the result of aneurysmal rupture with spread of blood into the subarachnoid cisterns (figure). CT images of a patient with a spontaneous SAH. CTA was performed to look for an aneurysm. Continue with the DSA... Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Notice that there are two aneurysms (arrows): Both were coiled. Click for larger view This patient presented with headache for four days and had a stiff neck due to meningeal irritation. The NECT images show hyperdense blood in the subarachnoid space.
There is an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery (arrow).
It has a high density and we think that is the thrombus inside the aneurysm.
This means that on a DSA the actual aneurysm may look smaller. MRI has a lower sensitivity for detecting a SAH than CT in the acute phase. MRI sometimes detects a SAH in the subacute phase..
The most sensitive sequence are the T2*gradient echo and FLAIR. These images are of a patient who was suspected of having a SAH a few days ago.
The NECT and most MR sequences were normal. Continue with the FLAIR images... Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll The FLAIR images show high signal intensity in the subarachnoid space. The arrows indicate the interpeduncular cistern anteriorly and the ambient cistern posteriorly. The differential diagnosis of high signal in the subarachnoid space on MRI is large: In this case it was the result of a SAH. Here we see an example of a subarachnoid haemorrhage on a NECT. Note the location of blood mainly around the brainstem and in the 3th and 4th ventricle. Often the location of subarachnoid blood helps to point in the direction of the aneurysm. The next step is performing a CT angiography, to search for an aneurysm as the cause of the SAH. This patient had a aneurysm at the origin of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Also note the hydrocefalus. This patient underwent a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and subsequent coiling. The DSA showed a saccular aneurysm of the left PICA of 6 mm in maximal diameter with a short, narrow neck. Saccular aneurysms are the most common type of aneurysm. They are round or lobulated and arise at bifurcations of the Circel of Willis. They are multiple in 20%. In 5% they measure over 2,5 cm and are called “Giant aneurysms”. Other type of aneurysms are fusiform (extreme focal ectasia in atherosclerotic disease) and mycotic aneurysms. The latter are seen as peripheral located intraparenchymal clots with white matter oedema surrounding haemorrhage. They are caused by septic emboli in patient with known bacteraemia. The location of the aneurysm can be suspected from the location of the hemorrhage. The images show a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a left cerebri media aneurysm.
Complications:
In the table the complications of a SAH are listed. Follow-up MRI performed 4 months after coiling  shows parenchymal loss in the territory of the left PICA. MRA showed no recanalisation of the aneurysm after coiling (not shown). Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in SAH As discussed earlier an intracerebral hemorrhage can spread to the subarachnoid space. The opposite is also possible. When an aneurysm ruptures the pressure of the jet can be so high, that the blood will be injected into the brain parenchyma as can be seen in this example. This patient presented with a subarachnoidal haemorrhage due to an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery. There is also an intraparenchymal heamatoma in the right gyrus rectus (arrow).
Perimesencephalic SAH:
Perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (PMSAH) is a subarachnoid hemorrhage with a different etiology and prognosis (ref). It is centered anteriorly to the pons and midbrain but may extend in small amounts into the basal and suprasellar cisterns and even into the Sylvian and interhemispheric fissure. Perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage is a nonaneurysmal form of SAH.
Patients with a perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage are not at risk for rebleeding in the initial years after the hemorrhage and have a normal life expectancy. 
The causes of PMSAH suggest a venous or capillary rupture at the level of the tentorial hiatus. The images show a slightly hyperdense focus in the prepontine and interpedunclair cystern in a patient who presented with acute severe headache.
DSA did not show an aneurysm. This patient complained of sudden onset headache with the sensation of a “burst” inside his head.
Neurological exam was normal, except for a stiff neck. The NECT showed a small amount of subarachnoidal blood anterior of the brainstem.
CTA showed no abnormalities.
DSA was not performed. Here another example of a nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic SAH. Left image: NECT showed a small amount of subarachnoidal blood anterior to the brainstem. Right image: more cranially, the pentagon, ambiens cistern and the proximal part of Sylvian’s fissures, did not show any blood. This is a typical presentation of nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic SAH.
The blood is solely located around the brainstem. To diagnose a perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal SAH, the patient has to meet all the criteria in the table (8). If all these criteria apply and the CTA does not show an aneurysm, you do not have to perform a DSA.
Role of CTA and DSA:
In a SAH we usually will find an aneurysm with CTA.
If the CTA does not show an aneurysm we usually continue with a DSA because it has a higher sensitivity. However if the CTA does not show an aneurysm and the clinical and CT-findings are compatible with a perimesenphalic hemorrhage, no further investigation is necessary (ref 8) Spontaneous peripherally located SAH a.k.a. “convexity SAH”
Spontaneous Convexity SAH:
CaseA 68 year old male presented with progressive tremor and weakness of right hand since one week. 
The differential diagnosis of the neurologists includes tumor or CVA. Besides hypertension, no relevant medical history. FLAIR-image shows the following findings: FLAIR is an excellent sequence to detect SAH in the subacute phase with almost a sensitivity of 100% from day 4-14. T2W-image confirms the presence of an abnormality in the central sulcus with low signal intensity corresponding to hemoglobin breakdown products. Susceptibility weighted imaging confirmed the SAH and also reveales multiple small punctate lobar hemorraghes, leading to the diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathie (CAA). In patients with a spontaneous non-traumatic convexity SAH, consider the following differential diagnosis:
Venous infarction:

Disable Scroll Whenever you see a hemorrhagic infarction, always think of the possibility of a venous infarction like in this case. When you scroll through the images, you will notice the thrombus in the right transverse sinus (arrowheads).
Arteriovenous Malformation:
A cerebral AVM is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins resulting in arteriovenous shunting through abnormal vessels called the nidus. The vessels that make up the nidus are fragile and can rupture, which results in hemorrhage. Most AVMs have a bleeding risk of 1-2% per year. The images are of a young female patient with sudden onset of headache several hours after the use of cocain.
She presented with a left sided hemi paralysis. Spetzler-Martin classification The Spetzler-Martin arteriovenous malformation (AVM) grading system allocates points for various features of intracranial arteriovenous malformations to give a grade between 1 and 5. 
Grade 6 is used to describe inoperable lesions. 
The score correlates with operative outcome. eloquent brainsensorimotor, language, visual cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, brain stem, cerebellar nuclei, or regions immediately adjacent to these structures non-eloquent brainfrontal lobe, temporal lobe, cerebellar hemispheres Click to enlarge image AVM 2 This patient presented with acute onset of severe headache. Blood is seen in three different locations: Continue with the CTA... CTA shows a prominent PICA (yellow arrow)  with a 7 mm saccular aneurysm (circle) located adjacent to the vermis. There is a dilated vein (blue arrow) which drains directly into the rectal sinus. In between the abnormal artery (PICA with aneurysm) and abnormal vein, a network of small vascular structures is seen (arrowheads), suspected of a nidus. Continue with the DSA... DSA confirms the right PICA with aneurysm (arrow) which lead to a nidus (circle). The nidus was drained by either superficial and deep veins (not separately shown here). Findings are concordant with an AVM - Spetzler Martin 2: The saccular aneurysm originating from the PICA was explained as a flow related aneurysm.
As a result of the changed hemodynamics due to the AVM, the vessel wall can become weakened and form an aneurysm. The images show DSA before and after coiling of the aneurysm. 
The PICA, nidus and abnormal draining veins (together forming the AVM)  still show contrast enhancement.
It was decided not to treat the AVM directly and to opt for follow-up and possibly operative exploration in the future. AVM 3 A 55 year old male presented with acute headache and a confused consciousness state. NCCT shows a lobar parenchymal hemorrhage surrounded by edema (left image). CTA only showed some dots of contrast (arrow) in the hemorrhage, connected to small abnormal vessels (not shown) below the hemorrhage. No feeding arteries of draining veins were visible. The mass effect of the hemorrhage can obscure the underlying cause in the acute phase. DSA and 3D images from the Right Internal Carotid artery showed an underlying AVM. Spetzler Martin 1 DSA control after surgical removal of the AVM shows no signs of residue. AVM 4 65 year old man complaining of acute onset of headache. NCCT shows bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage  and a parenchymal hemorrhage (yellow arrow). CTA show at the location of the parenchymal hemorrhage a flow related aneurysm of the anterior communicans artery, which was considered the cause of the SAH. 
Notice the hemorrhage next to the aneurysm (circle). CTA also showed an AVM with the nidus in the left frontal lobe (green arrow). In patients with an AVM flow dynamics may change in a way that the arterial walls become weakened and aneurysms may develop. Lateral view of the CTA: Left image: DSA of the aneurysm before treatment. Right image: DSA after treatment with separately coiling of the aneurysm and daughter sac (yellow arrow). It was decided to treat the aneurysm first and remove the AVM surgically in the sub acute phase when the patient has recovered from his subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF):
A dural arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between a dural artery and a vein or venous sinus. 
Due to the increased venous pressure a variety of symptoms may occur: pulsatile tinnitus, headache, raised intracranial pressure, epileptic seizures, venous infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage. The presence of cortical venous reflux in patients with DAVF increases the chance of neurological deficits due to venous infarction or hemorrhage. In contrast to arteriovenous malformation, a DAVF is usually an acquired disorder and may develop after cerebral venous thrombosis. Although DAVFs may be visible on 3D time of flight MRA, or CT angiography, DSA is still the gold standard to diagnose and classify the type of DAVF. Treatment consists of endovascular embolization of surgical disconnection. dAVF 1 This patient suffered from an intraventricular hemorrhage. Note the cortical venous reflux (arrowheads) on the CT-angiography with also venous ectasia (yellow arrow) near the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle as the bleeding spot. The DSA images (lateral view) confirmed a dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) Borden type 3, Cognard type IV. Note the massive cortical venous reflux with venous ectasia. Embolization with liquid agent (arrow) After trans-arterial embolization with liquid embolic agents (arrow), there was a complete obliteration of the DAVF. dAVF 2 This patient had intermitted speech disturbances. MRI showed a lobar hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe. On the 3D TOFMRA there was arterialization of the vein of Labbé (arrow). dAVF 2 Note the massive venous congestion on the T1 with Gadolineum (arrow). Lateral view of a injection into the distal maxillary artery (left) and occipital artery (right). dAVF 2 Note the direct fistula in a subarachnoid vein with cortical venous reflux through the vein of Labbé (arrow). This is a Borden 3, Cognard type IV. This patient was treated with embolization through the occipital artery (histroacryl) and middle meningeal artery (Squid ®) with complete obliteration of the DAVF. The patient recovered completely.
Cavernous malformation:
A cavernous malformation, also called cavernoma or cavernous hemangioma, is a vascular hamartoma.
It is a benign mass composed of immature vessels. 
Cavernomas may be congenital, but usually form during life. Patient may be asymptomatic or present with intracranial haemorrhage. Patients of any age may present with a cavernoma. A cavernous malformation is composed of immature vessels and may bleed. 
Imaging may depict various stages of bleeding. This example shows the typically appearance on MRI named “popcorn lesions”: a complete hemosiderin ring surrounding a heterogeneous lesion. They are usually located supratentorial, but may less commonly present in the pons or cerebellum. The Zabramski classification has been proposed as a way of classifying cerebral cavernous malformations, and although not used in clinical practice it is useful in scientific publications that seek to study cavernous malformations. On non-enhanced CT cavernomas are only seen when: Multiple cavernomas can be confused with multiple haemorrhagic metastasis. In the table some differences are listed.
Infarction with hemorrhagic transformation:
Lobar hemorrhage in hemorrhagic infarction This patient came to the emergency department with a left-sided hemiplegia and dysarthria. These symptoms quickly diminished and when they decided to dismiss the patient, the symptoms came back suddenly.
It was diagnosed as an acute infarction in the area of the right middle cerebral artery.
Thrombolytic therapy was started right away.
The next day the patient got worse and the second CT-scan showed a large hemorrhagic infarction in the right acm area. The next day this patient died. This patient was submitted to the stroke unit with a recent infarct in the left MCA territory. 
Due to delay in presentation outside the thrombolytic window, no thrombolytic therapy was given. A follow-up NECT (image A) was ordered because of clinically deterioration and showed a well demarcated hypodense area in the left MCA territory. In the hypodense area, very small subtle hyperdens foci were depicted. MRI several hours later the same day showed foci of hemorrhage (arrow) indicating petechial hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic infarct.
Hemorrhagic metastases:
This cortically located location at the grey-white matter junction is typical of hematogenously metastatic spread. 
They usually follow flow-dynamics: 80% anterior circulation vs. 20% posterior. Metastasis can become so large, that when they bleed, they present as a focal lobar hemorrhage. 50% of hemorrhagic metastases present as a solitary lesion and the other half presents as two or more lesions. The most common hemorrhagic metastases are:
Hemorrhagic Brain tumor:
Intratumoral hemorrhage The glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumour to show intratumoral haemorrhage. In oligodendrogliomas haemorrhage occurs in 20%. An other common known acute presentation of intratumor haemorrhage is apoplexia due to bleeding in a hypophyseal macroadenoma. The CT-images show:
Pituitary Apoplexia:
This patient presented with sudden headache, nausea and vomiting. 
He had ptosis of his left eye. The images show a pituitary macroadenoma with extension into the cavernous sinus. 
Note the subtle hyperdensities in the tumour (arrow). 
On a T1W non-enhanced image there is mild hyperintensity posteriorly and cranially in the tumor. These findings suggested intratumoral hemorrhage, which was confirmed at surgery. by Sara Shams, MD et al. Cerebrovasc Dis. 2016

Anatomy and Pathology of the Infrahyoid Neck:
Frank Pameijer, Erik Beek, Frank Joosten and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the University Medical Centre of Utrecht, the Rijnstate Hospital in Arnhem and the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2009-12-07 In this article we will focus on: the 5 anatomical spaces of the infrahyoid neck. Anatomy of the Infrahyoid Neck
Anatomy of the Infrahyoid Neck:

Surgical triangles:
The infrahyoid neck is the region of the neck extending from the hyoid bone to the thoracic inlet. Traditionally the anatomy of the infrahyoid neck has been subdivided into a group of surgical triangles whose borders are readily palpable bones and muscles (figure). These triangles have a cranial-caudal orientation and therefore are difficult to correlate with cross-sectional imaging. Another approach to the anatomy of the neck is the so-called 'spatial approach', which we shall use in this review. Notice the musculus omohyoideus in the illustration. This is one of the 'strap' muscles, an important landmark in the neck. It is a group of four pairs of muscles in the anterior part of the neck: the sternothyroid, sternohyoid, thyrohyoid and omohyoid muscles. They are all attached to the hyoid bone and look like a strap. The other strap-muscles are not drawn in this illustration. The infrahyoid neck is separated from the suprahyoid neck by the hyoid bone (arrow) In the spatial approach to the anatomy of the infrahyoid neck, the cross-sectional anatomy is described as a series of spaces defined by the various layers of the deep cervical fascia. This facilitates the understanding and interpretation of cross-sectional imaging modalities like CT and MRI (1). Some of these infrahyoid spaces are continuous with the suprahyoid neck and some are continuous with the superior mediastinum. Spaces defined by the deep cervical fascia
Spaces of the infrahyoid neck:
The infrahyoid neck is divided into 5 major anatomical compartments or spaces by the various layers of the cervical fascia (2). These spaces are well recognized in the axial plane and therefore suited for analysis on axial CT or MR. Central compartment containing several viscera like the larynx, thyroid, hypopharynx and cervical esophagus.
2. Carotid space Paired space just lateral to the visceral compartment which contains the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein and several neural structures.
3. Retropharyngeal space 
A small virtual space containing only fat continuous with the suprahyoid space and the middle mediastinum.
4. Posterior Cervical Space 
Paired space posterolateral to the carotid space. It contains fat, lymph nodes and neural elements.
5. Perivertebral space This large space completely encircles the vertebral body including the pre- and paravertebral muscles. On the left a CT image of a patient with massive subcutaneous emphysema after a motor vehicle accident. Air has dissected along the layers of the cervical fascia. Notice that you are able to find all five spaces - they are now outlined by air.
Systematic approach:
The systematic approach to pathology in the infrahyoid neck is a three-step procedure: In which space is the lesion located?
* Step 2: What are the normal contents of this space?
* Step 3: What pathology arises from these contents and can we recognize a specific radiological pattern and does this correspond to the clinical information?
Visceral space:
The visceral space extends from the hyoid to the anterior mediastinum and does not extend into the suprahyoid space. On the left the normal contents and derived pathology of the visceral space. The CT section is at the level of the supraglottic larynx and the thyroid cartilage. Anterior to the thyroid cartilage are the 'strap' muscles: sternothyroid, sternohyoid, thyrohyoid and omohyoid . They are all connected to the hyoid and depress the hyoid bone and larynx during swallowing and speaking. These muscles are long and flat much like a strap. We will now continue with a few cases. Although we have provided the diagnosis in these cases, we still want you to follow the 3-step approach.
Laryngocele:
Step 1: which space On the left a patient with a swelling on the right side of the neck. Study the image and decide in which space the lesion is located. Then continue reading. The swelling is centered within the borders of the thyroid cartilage. Therefore this must be pathology arising in the visceral space. Laryngocele (courtesy: Ilona Schmallfuss) Step 2: normal contents On the left an additional image is shown at a slightly lower level. Study the images and decide which structures in the visceral space are present at this level and which are not. Then continue reading. The CT section shows the lesion present at the level of the supraglottic larynx and the thyroid cartilage. So we are much too cranial for trachea, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands and recurrent laryngeal nerve, which lies in the tracheo-esophageal groove. Paratracheal Level VI lymph nodes are located around the larynx and not within the larynx, so they can be ruled out. The hypopharynx is posterior to the lesion and has a normal appearance. Embryological remnants like thyroglossal duct cyst can be considered, but these are typically embedded in the laryngeal strap musculature and therefore should be located anterior to the thyroid cartilage. So the only normal anatomy from which this lesion could have arisen is the larynx. Step 3: Pattern recognition This lesion presents as a cystic lesion with sharply defined, enhancing boundaries. The lesion is located in the supraglottic larynx in the right paraglottic space and also has an extralaryngeal component, which explains the lump on the right side of the neck. At endoscopy a large submucosal swelling on the right was seen in the larynx. Squamous cell cancer, which is a mucosal disease, can therefore be dismissed. When we think about the radiological appearance of the four submucosal entities mentioned in the table on the left, we can make the following remarks: Secondary internal and external laryngocele caused by a tumor at the level of the laryngeal ventricle ( enhancing mass on the right image) Laryngocele (2) When a larynocele is suspected you always have to search carefully for an underlying cause. Primary laryngocele has no underlying cause. 
Secondary laryngocele arises due to pathology in the laryngeal ventricle, which is a slit-like opening between the true and the false vocal cords. A secondary laryngocele is frequently caused by a squamous cell carcinoma, as in this case. At endoscopy the tumor may be obscured by the laryngocele itself. LEFT: Coronal CT image through the larynx with normal anatomy: false cords (F), true cords (T) and ventricle in between (V) RIGHT:Fluid-filled secondary internal and external laryngocele due to a small enhancing tumor in the laryngeal ventricle (T) obstructing the laryngeal ventricle. On the left side, an air-filled primary internal and external laryngocele. Mechanism of a laryngocele The laryngeal ventricle (v) is a slit-like opening between the false and true vocal cords (image far left). It is the anatomic landmark between supraglottis and glottis. The ventricle extends laterally and then cranially into the paraglottic space. When the opening of the laryngeal ventricle is completely obstructed by tumor, the mucosa in the paraglottic space continues to produce fluid. This results in a fluid-filled internal laryngocele. Eventually the paraglottic space becomes filled up and the internal laryngocele will become external by extending outside of the larynx through the thyro-hyoid membrane. When the opening of the laryngeal ventricle is partially obstructed, a pressure-valve mechanism may result in an air-containing internal laryngocele which may, eventually, become external (right image, red arrow).
Squamous cell carcinoma:
On the left, a CT-image at the level of the thyroid cartilage. There is an irregular mass centered in the right piriform sinus. This mass is in the visceral space. In this region the most common tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma. This was proven at biopsy. Notice the retropharyngeal space (yellow arrow). This is a virtual space containing only some fat. Squamous cell carcinoma (2) On the left, contiguous slices in a craniocaudal direction at the level of the larynx. Study this case, which is quite similar to a previously discussed case and then continue reading. Multinodular goiter Strap muscles on right side (yellow arrow) and presumed position of strap muscles on the left (blue arrow)
Multinodular goiter:
Step 1: Which space On the left a patient with a swelling on the left side of the neck, which has existed for years. The swelling is adjacent to the left lamina of the thyroid cartilage. The strap musculature seems to be draped over the lesion (blue arrow). Therefore this lesion lies within the visceral space. Step 2: Normal contents Analysis of the normal anatomical contents of the visceral space rules out many possible tissues and organs from which this pathology may arise: This mass is located outside of the larynx and hypopharynx. The hypopharynx is slightly displaced due to the retropharyngeal extension of the mass and the lesion lies cranial to the trachea.
* Embryological remnants 
Remnants like thyroglossal duct cyst can be considered but these lesions are usually cystic.
* Paratracheal lymph nodes 
These are located outside of the strap musculature.
* Recurrent laryngeal nerve 
This nerve is located within the tracheo-esophageal groove. By exclusion we can say that this mass arises either from the thyroid gland or the parathyroid glands. Multinodular goiter with intrathoracic extention Step 3: Pattern recognition and clinical information On the chest film we notice a displacement of the trachea to the right by an upper mediastinal mass. So the mass is located within the visceral space and extends into the anterior mediastinum, since the trachea is located within the anterior mediastinum. It is well-defined towards the surrounding fat and there are a few scattered coarse calcifications. When we combine these findings, we recognize the radiological pattern of a benign multinodular goiter. This diagnosis is compatible with the clinical information that the swelling in the neck has been present for years. Thyroglossal duct cyst: axial T1- and T2-weighted images at the level of the hyoid bone
Thyroglossal duct cyst:
On the left axial T1- and T2-weighted images at the level of the hyoid bone. There was no enhancement on the post Gadolinium study (not shown) It is a midline cystic lesion, party external and partly internal to the hyoid bone and located in the visceral space. The lesion is embedded in the strap musculature. It is unlikely that this lesion arises from the trachea, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands or recurrent laryngeal nerve, since these structures are located more caudally. Lymph nodes are usually seen in the subcutaneous fat around the larynx. By exclusion a thyroglossal duct cyst is the most likely diagnosis. Thyroglossal duct cyst (2) Key facts Paramedian thyroglossal duct cyst On the left an example of a paramedian thyroglossal duct cyst. This lesion not in the midline, but the key finding is that this lesion is cystic and embedded in the strap musculature. Paramedian thyroglossal duct cyst Thyroglossal duct cyst (3) When the diagnosis thyroglossal duct cyst is made, always check if there is a thyroid in the normal position. The thyroid anlage may never travel along the thyroglossal duct. In that case it stays at the tongue base. In these rare cases, the patient has a so-called lingual thyroid. On the left another paramedian thyroglossal duct cyst Lingual thyroid (courtesy: Tony Hasso) On the left, a child with a lingual thyroid. This is the only functioning thyroid tissue that this child has. It would be a disaster if such a 'lesion' were to be excised. On the left images of a three-year old girl with a slowly enlarging tumor in the midline. On ultrasound a hypoechoic ovoid smooth bordered lesion is seen at the level of the hyoid bone and slightly right off midline (left image). During US examination, the lesion moves simultaneously with extrusion of the tongue. Cystic nature and close relation to the hyoid bone makes thyroglossal duct cyst the most likely diagnosis. Notice that a normal thyroid gland is present (right image).
Carotid space:
The carotid space extends from the skull base to the aortic arch. It transverses the suprahyoid and infrahyoid neck into the anterior mediastinum. On the left the normal contents of the carotid space and the derived pathology. Paraganglioma: T1-weighted Gadolineum enhanced MR image at the level of the supraglottic larynx
Paraganglioma:
Step 1: Which space On the left a patient with a swelling on the left side of the neck. Study the MR-image at the level of the supraglottic larynx and decide in which space the lesion is located. Then continue reading. The swelling is centered between the external and internal carotid artery. Notice that these vessels are compressed. Evidently this lesion must be located in the carotid space. Please note that there is a smaller, but identical, lesion present, located in the right carotid space. Step 2: Normal contents Now we must try to figure out the normal anatomical source that has caused this pathology.
Once again, we use exclusion: As the name implies, these lesions are cystic.
* Neural structures in the carotid space like the vagus nerve and sympathetic plexus are located between the great vessels. Therefore it is very likely that the bilateral swellings of this patient are coming from these neural structures. Now we are down to a fairly limited and space-specific differential diagnosis (see next image). The only exception to this rule is in patients with neurofibromatosis. Unlike this lesion, schwannomas and neurofibromas occur unilaterally. Although they enhance on MR, flow voids are usually absent.
* Paragangliomas are frequently multiple in 3% to 5% of patients overall and 20% to 30% with a positive family history. These lesions show intense enhancement on CT and MR as seen on this coronal post-Gadolinium MR-image. In the larger lesion on the left, typical flow voids are present (see also axial image). So we can conclude that there are bilateral intensely enhancing lesions with flow voids in the carotid space, most likely carotid body tumors or paragangliomas. Paraganglioma: Ultrasound with color doppler, T1-weighted non-contrast MR and CECT Paraganglioma (2) On the left images of a 21-year old female with a mass on the right. This lesion is located between the internal and external carotid artery and therefore is a neural tumor. The differential diagnosis is limited to tumors arising from the vagus nerve and sympathetic plexus. On CT and color doppler the mass is clearly hypervascular and the only possible diagnosis is a paraganglioma. Paraganglioma (3) Key facts Schwannoma: axial T2-weighted image and angiogram
Schwannoma:
On the left images of a 28-year old female with a nontender mass at the left mandibular angle. Step 1
The mass is located in carotid space. Step 2 Anatomical contents: carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, sympathetic plexus, lymph nodes (Level 2-4) and congenital remnants of the 2nd branchial cleft . Step 3 Therefore it is very likely that this mass has a neural origin: They do enhance, but are not particularly hypervascular. Flow voids are usually absent. It is not possible to discriminate between these two possibilities based on their radiological appearance. Thrombosis of jugular vein
Jugular vein thrombosis:
Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein is an under-diagnosed condition that may occur as a complication of head and neck infections, surgery, central venous access, and intravenous drug abuse. An infected jugular vein thrombus caused by extension of an oropharyngeal infection is referred to as Lemierre's syndrome. This is a bacterial infection that may have severe morbidity or even fatal outcome, as eventually septic emboli may spread to the lungs. On the left a patient who had undergone a total laryngectomy several years previously. The present complaint is a painful swelling on the left side of the neck since one day. Step 1 Contrast-enhanced CT at mid-neck level shows the neopharynx with some surgical clips on the left and the enhancing right thyroid lobe which is still in situ. In addition there is a round, hypodense lesion in the left carotid space. Thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein Step 2 In this case, analysis of the normal anatomical contents of the carotid space can be short. When we compare left to right it is clear that we are dealing with an internal jugular vein which is enlarged and does not enhance. An image at a higher level shows the same appearance of the internal jugular vein (arrow). Step 3 In combination with the clinical information of a painful swelling on the left side of the neck, there is only one possible diagnosis: Acute thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein. Lemierre' s syndrome Lemierre' s syndrome When you diagnose an acute thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, always look for pulmonary symptoms, i.e. Lemierre' s syndrome. The oral infection spreads into the neck and causes internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis with subsequent septic emboli. Secondary infected branchial cleft cyst (courtesy Berit Verbist)
Second branchial cleft cyst:
On the left images of a 36-year old female with a progressive swelling on the left side of the neck. She had recently recovered from a peritonsillar abscess. ENT-examination showed a fistula orifice in the left tonsil. The position of the mass on the CT indicates that it is located in the carotid space. Analysis based on normal anatomical contents: Second branchial cleft cyst: small fistula tract (arrow) Second branchial cleft cyst (2) Key facts Second branchial cleft cyst On the left a longitudinal and transverse image fo a large second branchial cleft cyst in a 12-year old girl situated between the parotid gland (left image) and the submandibular gland (right image). It is superficial to the carotid artery and jugular vein (arrow). The cyst contents is hypoechoic with freely moving debris. Second branchial cleft cyst The MR of the same patient confirms the presence of a cystic mass in the right carotid space. The lesion is situated between the submandibular gland and the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which is the classic position of a second branchial cleft cyst. The lesion shows edge enhancement post-Gadolinium. Notice that these lesions may contain small amounts of lymphoid tissue which is a possible explanation for the small area of enhancement inside the cyst wall (arrow). Second branchial cleft cyst: high signal intensity on STIR Coronal STIR image of the same cyst.
Retropharyngeal Space:
Retropharyngeal space The retropharyngeal space extends superiorly to the base of the skull and inferiorly to the posterior mediastinum at the level of the tracheal bifurcation. In normal circumstances, the retropharyngeal space is a virtual space and contains the retropharyngeal lymph nodes superiorly as well as some fatty tissue. Infections of the mouth can spread through this space into the posterior mediastinum. There are two other spaces in close proximity to the retropharyngeal space: the danger space and the prevertebral space. They are often confused with the retropharyngeal space. The danger space actually lies between the alar fascia, which forms the posterior border of the retropharyngeal space, and the prevertebral fascia. It extends from the cranial base above to the level of the diaphragm. The prevertebral space is bounded anteriorly by the prevertebral fascia and posteriorly by the longus colli muscles of the spine. It extends down the mediastinum and continues to the insertion of the psoas muscles. All we need to realize is that pathology in this region can extend into the posterior mediastinum and we should not stop imaging until the tracheal bifurcation is reached.
Retropharyngeal abscess:
On the left an axial contrast enhanced CT-image of an infant with fever. The child cannot swallow. This pathology is located in the retropharyngeal space. The prevertebral muscles are pushed towards the vertebral body. If this were a lesion located in the perivertebral space, these muscles would be pushed anteriorly. The retropharyngeal space is expanded and contains multiple pockets of material with fluid density. Obviously this is a retropharyngeal infection with multiple abscesses. This is an emergency situation because the abscesses will expand and may eventually obstruct the airways. Usually these deep abscesses require surgical drainage. On the left an adult patient with a retropharyngeal abscess after surgical drainage. The drainage catheters run from left to right through the retropharyngeal space. The retropharyngeal space can become infected in two ways. The 'classic' retropharyngeal abscess observed in pediatric patients occurs when an upper respiratory infection like pharyngitis or adenoiditis spreads to retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Penetrating trauma, i.e. foreign bodies, fish bones or iatrogenic causes such as endoscopy or intubation, can also be involved in retropharyngeal space infection.
Retropharyngeal edema:
On the left two images of a patient with a piriform sinus carcinoma (shown earlier). On the far left the pirifrom sinus tumor before radiotherapy. The image next to it shows complete response after the radiotherapy. The retropharyngeal space is now distended and shows increased density of the fatty tissue due to post-radiotherapy edema.
Posterior cervical space:
On the left a table with the normal contents of the posterior cervical space and subsequent pathology. MPNST is short for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, which is the proper name for a malignant schwannoma.
Lymphoma:
Step 1: Which space On the left a patient with bilateral swelling in the neck. CT image at the level of the hyoid bone shows multiple rounded lesions medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscles and dorsal to the internal jugular veins. These bilateral multiple lesions are located in the posterior cervical space. Step 2 Analysis of the normal anatomical components of the posterior cervical space: The fat looks normal.
* Accessory nerve Accessory nerve pathology is expected to be unilateral.
* Brachial plexus Brachial plexus pathology like neurofibromatosis could be considered. 
 However we would expect continuous lesions like nerves and not these separate rounded lesions.
* Primitive embryonic lymph sacs: Congenital remnants like cystic hygroma can be bilateral. These are confluent cystic low-density lesions. Step 3 By exclusion we can conclude that these are bilaterally enlarged lymph nodes with homogeneous enhancement. Homogeneous enhancement is typical for lymphoma. Central necrosis is more typical for squamous cell carcinoma metastases. Lymph node biopsy in this patient revealed B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphoma (2) On the left images of a 67-year old woman who had a history of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She had recently noticed a swelling on the left side of the neck. Step 1 CT image at the level of the true vocal cords shows a mass, which is clearly located in the posterior cervical space. Step 2 The mass is well-defined and isodense to muscle. Coronal reformation shows the mass to be elongated and extending towards the axilla following rhe course of the cervico-brachial plexus.. Continue with the MR images. Recurrent NHL with diffuse infiltration of the left brachial plexus The lesion originates at the left neural foramina and grows along the course of the brachial plexus (red arrow). In fact, we are looking at a grossly thickened plexus. Step 3 The radiological pattern confirms the neurogenic origin of the mass. Combined with the history the final diagnosis is diffuse infiltration of the left brachial plexus by recurrent NHL.
Lipoma:
On the left images of a patient with a swelling posteriorly on the left side of the neck. MR image at the level of the hyoid bone. The lesion is located in the posterior cervical space. Analysis of the normal anatomical components of the posterior cervical space can be short in this case. The mass has the signal intensity of fat on a T1-weighted image and the signal is completely suppressed with fat suppression. There was no enhancement (not shown), so we can conclude that this is a lipoma. Lipoma in the right posterior cervical space On the left T1- and T2-weighted images of another patient with a lipoma. Lymphangioma
Lymphangioma or Cystic hygroma:
On the left an axial T2-weighted image with fatsat and a coronal T1-weighted image of a 12-year old girl who presented with a soft swelling in the neck. Step 1
A multiloculated lesion is present in the posterior cervical space. Step 2
Analysis of the anatomical components: The coronal T1-weighted image shows normal fat around the lesion.
* Nerves: Accessory nerve pathology is rare and we would expect a solitary solid lesion. Brachial plexus lesions are expected to be located in a more paraspinal location.
* Lymph nodes: 
Can be considered, but these are solid or partly solid.
Embryological remnants: 
Remnants of the primitive lymphatic system like lymphangioma are most common in this age group and should be considered. Lymphangioma Step 3 On the T2-weighted image with fatsat the lesion is multiloculated and has a fluid intensity. There is no enhancement on the T1-weighted image. These findings, in combination with the fact that the swelling is soft and is present in a child, is specific for the diagnosis of a lymphangioma, also known as cystic hygroma. Cystic hygroma located in the right floor of the mouth in a young adult patient (courtesy: Tony Hasso) Lymphangioma (2) Key facts May occur anywhere in the head and neck. Mostly located in posterior cervical space. 10% extend into the mediastinum.
* High signal on T2-weighted images Signal on T1-weighted images depends on protein content.
* Hemorrhage results in rapid growth and fluid-fluid levels as seen on MR.
Perivertebral space:
On the left a table with the normal contants of the perivertebral space and subsequent pathology.
Sarcoma:
On the left a contrast enhanced CT image through the upper neck of a patient who complained of a slowly growing swelling posteriorly on the left side of the neck. Step 1: Which space There is a large soft tissue mass adjacent to the vertebral body centered in the perivertebral space. Step 2 Analysis of the normal anatomical components of the perivertebral space: Step 3 The normal fat planes between the individual muscles have disappeared. The imaging characteristics are otherwise non-specific. This leaves us with a fairly large differential diagnosis of muscle pathology: sarcoma, fibromatosis, lymphoma and infection. The clinical information of a slow-growing mass favors a malignant process. Biopsy of the mass revealed sarcoma. Sagittal T1-weighted image and axial image post-Gadolinium

RECIST 1.1 - and more:

Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors:
Fokko Smits, Martijn Dirksen and Ivo Schoots
Radiology Department of the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam and the Isala hospital in Zwolle, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2020-7-5 RECIST is a standard way to measure the response of a tumor to treatment. It provides objective criteria to determine whether a tumor disappears, shrinks, stays the same or gets bigger. 
This is called complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). In this article we describe the five easy steps to follow when you want to use RECIST 1.1. Recist 1.1 is not used for lymphoma, GIST during Glivec therapy, HCC and malignant brain tumors. 
Other criteria have been published for these tumors.
In addition a brief overview is given of variations of RECIST and some other response systems.
Introduction:
RECIST is a standard way to measure the response of a tumor to treatment. If a study is eligible, choose target lesions (max 5) that are easy to measure and calculate the sum of the longest diameters (SLD).
Identify non-target lesions like ascites or pleural fluid that are not suited for exact measurements, but that can be followed. In the follow up study compare these lesions and determine the response.
Baseline Study - five easy steps:

1. Is the study eligible for RECIST?:
Radiographic studies that may be used: Ultrasound is not used for RECIST due to operator dependency.
2. Choose “target lesions”:
Tumors
Choose preferably large well-described lesions to measure with a maximum of two per organ and a maximum of five for the whole study. Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes can be used as target lesions provided that the maximum short axis diameter exceeds 15 mm.
Nodes <10 mm are regarded as normal, while nodes 10-15mm are regarded as pathologic, but not suited for target lesions. They can be used as non-target lesions. Not target lesions Measurement includes hypervascular rim When a lesion has a hypervascular rim, this is included in measuring the longest diameter, because it represent viable tumor tissue. The CT images in the arterial and portovenous phase of a 71-year-old male show liver metastases of a neuro-endocrine tumour of the esophagus.
Note that the hypervascular rim is better appreciated in the arterial phase.
The large hypervascular rim is included in the measurement of the largest diameter. Measurements of the tumour thickness perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum in two positions at three different levels. Mesothelioma An exception to measuring the longest diameter is in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
The non-spherical growth pattern in this disease makes reproducible long axis measurements difficult.
Therefore not the longest diameter, but the tumour thickness perpendicular to the chest wall is used. 
This measurement has a good correlation with outcome. CT images in a 63-year-old male with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Measurements according to the modified RECIST 1.1 for malignant pleural mesothelioma with measurement of the tumour thickness perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum in two positions at three different levels, preferably in the upper thorax. Non-measurable lesions Example of non-measurable lesions in a patient with lymphangitis carcinomatosa and another patient with ascites. These findings are used as non-target lesions and in the follow up their presence or absence are determined. Left: non-measurable metastasis. Right: measurable metastasis. Bone metastases During follow-up bone metastases quite often change in appearance while the size remains the same, therefore they are generally considered non-measurable lesions. According to RECIST 1.1. only lytic or mixed lytic-blastic bone metastases with identifiable soft tissue component can be considered as measurable lesions if they meet the measurability criteria. The left CT image is of a 80-year-old male with osteoblastic bone metastases of a non-small-cell lung carcinoma.
This lesion is not suitable for measurement. The CT image on the right is of a 69-year-old female with an osteolytic metastasis in the right iliac bone.  
This metastasis is suitable for measurement and can be used as target lesion. Sometimes the largest lesion is not the most suitable for reproducible repeated measurements.
This CT image is of a 61-year-old male with gastric cancer and lymph node metastases. 
There is a large lobulated mobile gastric tumor.
We can assume, that on a follow up examination it can not be reproduced in the same way.
Therefore this mobile tumor is not suitable as target lesion, but can be used as non-target lesion. Continue with next image... At a lower level there is an enlarged lymph node which is more suitable to be used a target lesion (arrow).
3. Calculate Sum of Longest Diameters:
Here an example of 5 target lesions in a 28-year-old male with a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the appendix with liver, lymphogenic and peritoneal metastases. Non-target lesions: miliary lung metastases of ovarian cancer.
4. Identify non-target lesions:
What are “non-target” lesions”?Non-target lesions are all other disease related lesions that do not meet the criteria for a target lesion like pleural fluid, ascites and miliary lung metastases, or those lesions that are supernumerary because the maximum number of 5 target lesions had been reached. You do not measure these lesions. Just mention them in the report and in the follow up look for their presence or absence. The CT image with maximum intensity projection of a 34-year-old female with miliary lung metastases of ovarian cancer. The metastases cannot be used as target lesions because they are too small. They can be used as non-target lesions and can be mentioned as a single item in the radiology report.
5. Report:
The baseline radiology reportshould contain the following elements:
Follow up study:

Is the study technically comparable to previous?:
For follow-up studies, the same imaging modality should be used as for the baseline study and identical imaging parameters should be used, like slice-thickness, contrast protocol etc. In this case if the same orientation is used in the follow up, the measurement would be too small.
Identify same target lesions:
OrientationIf the orientation of longest diameter varies during follow-up, measure the longest diameter (fig). Do's forcing overall response to progressive disease.
* Do measure the short axis of mesothelioma. Dont's Fragmentation
If the lesion breaks into separate fragments between baseline and follow-up, the sum of longest diameters (SLD) of the fragments should be calculated. Vice versa if lesions coalesce, then measure the longest diameter of the merged lesion only. Obviously, the short axis diameter is measured in lymph nodes. Too small to measure If a target lesion has disappeared record a measurement of 0 mm.
If the lesion is too small to measure assign a default value of 5 mm to prevent false responses (derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness). The images are of a patient with a primary lung tumour.
At baseline, the longest diameter is well above 10 mm, therefore this was assigned as a target lesion. 
During follow-up the long-axis diameter dropped below 10 mm, which is the lower limit for considering a lesion as target lesion. 
However, since this is a follow-up measurement, the target lesion still counts up to the sum of the diameters (SLD) and a default value of 5mm was assigned. Cavitating lesions
Cavitation can occur during treatment.
Cavitating lesions should be continuously measured in their longest diameter. 
A different assessment can be provided if the sum of diameters does not adequately correspond to the patients response assessment. These CT images are of a 32-year-old male with a pulmonary metastasis of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour. 
Cavitation occured after treatment with pazopanib, but the size remained the same. Although the size remains the same, a remark can be made in the report, that the actual tumorvolume has decreased. Lymph node target lesion 18mm at baseline (left). At follow up only 4mm.
Calculate SLD:
If during follow-up the short-axis diameter of a lymph node drops below 15 mm, the measurements are continued and still count for calculation of the SLD. In this case the baseline short axis diameter is 18 mm. 
This was a target lesion. At follow-up, the short-axis diameter dropped below 15 mm. However, the measurements are continued, and the 4 mm diameter counts up for the SLD. When lymph nodes decrease to a normal size (<10 mm), they still have to be included in the sum of the target lesions.
This means that whenever the lymph nodes enlarge again, you will not overstate the progression, but also that complete remission is possible even when the sum of the diameters is not zero.
Progression of non-target lesions:
CT images in a 61-year-old male with melanoma during treatment. At baseline the inguinal lymph nodes were to small to be used as target lesions and were regarded as non-target lesions. At follow up there is unequivocal progression of the lymphogenic metastases. CT images in a 61-year-old male with unequivocal progression of non-target lymphogenic metastases of melanoma during treatment. CT images in a 73-year-old male with progressive liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. 
This is anothe example of progression of non-target lesions. Even if there is partial response or even disappearance of other lesions, this is still progressive disease. New lesions means progressive disease
New lesions:
Any new lesion means progressive disease. CT-images in a 81-year-old female with endometrial carcinoma and occurrence of new liver metastases during treatment with chemotherapy. The sclerotic bone lesions in b and d are not new metastases but an osteoblastic reaction. Courtesy Els van Persijn van Meerten. Any new lesion means progressive disease, but not every newly detected lesion is always a true new lesion. In osteolytic bone metastases it can be difficult to determine if a sclerotic lesion that is detecting during follow up is truly a new lesion. The CT images are of a 50-year-old female with bone metastases of a breast carcinoma. 
At baseline (a), there is an osteolytic lesion in a thoracic vertebral body (arrow).
After chemotherapy, the thoracic osseous lesion has not changed in size, but has become completely osteoblastic (arrow in b), representing a good response. In the lumbar vertebra no visible metastases were seen in the baseline scan (c). 
The ‘new’ sclerotic lesions in the lumbar vertebra (arrowheads in d), are considered to be small osteolytic metastases that the baseline CT failed to identify. 
They became visible due to the osteoblastic reaction.
PET:
FDG-PET can be complementary to diagnostic CT imaging in assessment of disease progression, especially in the case of a possible new lesion. 
A positive FDG-PET at follow-up, with a negative FDG-PET at baseline, is a sign of progressive disease based on the new lesion.
Without an FDG-PET examination at baseline, findings are dependent on current and previous CT findings. CT images in a 72-year-old male with recurrent esophageal carcinoma and a re-appearing lung metastasis.
Reappearance of lesions:
Disappearance and subsequent reappearance of a lesion in follow-up examinations should continue to be measured.
Depending on the disease status, a reappearing lesion can be considered either progressive disease, when the previous examination showed complete response or otherwise the maximal diameter should be added to the SLD for a calculated response. The rationale is that most lesions do not disappear but are under the detection level of the employed imaging modality.
Response categories:
To determine the response of a tumor in the follow up, we have to look at the target- and non-target lesions and look for any new lesions. Progressive Disease (PD) Stable Disease (SD) Partial Response (PR) Complete Response (CR) *Nadir is the smallest sum of diameters (SLD) during treatment.
Response in target lesions with or without non-target disease:
The overall response is based on the response of all tumor related findings (table). For instance any progression ( >20% increase) of target or non-target lesions or any new lesion means progressive disease no matter how the other lesions reacted. When tumor markers are initially elevated, they must normalize before considering complete response when all lesions have disappeared.
Response in only non-target lesions:
In some patients there are no suitable target lesions that can be measured and there are only non-target lesions.
In these cases you have to make an estimation of the response (table).
Radiology report:
The radiology report of each follow-up study should contain the following elements: ReportModality and parameters
Description of target lesions with localization, table position and    size
Description of non-target lesions and comparison: unchanged, decreased or increased in size.
New lesions?
Incidental relevant findings Conclusion
Number of target lesions and their localization, overall impression of non-target lesions, clinically important incidental findings. The table shows an example of a follow up report. Calculation of SLD and assigning response categories by the radiologist depend on local agreement with the oncologist.
Quite commonly, only measurements of target disease and presence and extent of non-target disease are reported with an impression of the overall tumor response mentioned in the report’s conclusion.
Other Response systems:

Choi criteria for GIST:
The Choi criteria are based on RECIST and developed for The Choi criteria are based on RECIST and developed for assessing treatment response in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated with imatinib (3). Usually decrease in tumour size occurs in the course of treatment, however this doesn’t necessarily reflect tumour response. Sometimes tumour size can increase due to internal hemorrhage, necrosis or myxoid degeneration. Major difference of Choi response criteria in comparison to RECIST 1.1 is the introduction of tumour attenuation as an additional response parameter. Reduction in tumor size is usually minimal in the early posttreatment response assessment, while significant changes in internal characteristics like tumour attenuation, nodularity, and number of vessels will occur. The CT images of a 82-year-old male show liver metastases of a GIST at baseline (arrowheads). 
All metastases decrease somewhat in size after treatment with imatinib, but the most remarkable difference is a decrease in density.
This is considered to be a good response according to the Choi criteria. Before the introduction of the Choi response criteria, recurrent or progressive disease used to be determined by an increase in tumour size or identification of new locations of disease.
Although increase in tumour size remains an important parameter for evaluating disease response, recurrent disease can occur within the treated tumor without increasing tumor size. The CT images in a 66-year-old male show liver metastases of a GIST at diagnosis (a).
At 3 months after treatment with imatinib there is a good response (b).
At a follow up scan at 1 year there is a  recurrence (arrow in c).
At a  follow-up after 2nd line treatment with sunitinib there is still tumor progression, but the size remains the same (d).
mRECIST for Hepatocellular carcinomas:
Tumour response assessment based on changes in size alone can be deceptive when applied to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with targeted or interventional therapies. In 2000 the European Association for the Study of the liver (EASL) assembled an expert panel on HCC which suggested that the optimal method for treatment response assessment in HCC should be the estimation of viable tumour with contrast enhanced imaging. These new criteria were based on RECIST 1.1 and referred to as modified RECIST (mRECIST) with the most important feature of defining viable tumour as uptake of contrast agent during arterial phase dynamic imaging on CT or MRI. mRECIST is only used for typical lesions showing intratumoral arterial enhancement, while RECIST 1.1 is applied for atypical enhancing lesions and extrahepatic disease. The table shows extra recommendations for the assessment of tumor response in non-target lesions in patients with HCC and cirrhosis. Measurement rules in assessing response: Rules of progression: The CT image of the liver of a 96-year-old male with HCC in the late arterial phase shows a hypervascular tumour in the right liver lobe (arrowheads).
The tumor is well delineated from the surrounding parenchyma.
In the portal-venous phase the HCC is hardly distinguishable from the liver parenchyma due to early washout of contrast. This HCC is suitable for mRECIST.
iRECIST for immune therapy:
iRECIST represents a modified RECIST 1.1 for immune-based therapeutics. The immunotherapeutic agents induce a different tumour response in comparison to standard chemotherapeutic agents. The new mechanism of actions of these drugs, with immune and T-cell activation, can cause uncommon patterns of tumour response that look like tumour flare, termed pseudoprogression (4). 
Pseudoprogression has been described in non-small cell lung carcinoma, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. These patients meet the criteria for disease progression according to traditional response criteria like RECIST, but can demonstrate late and durable responses. The main criteria to objectively evaluate tumour response are mostly unchanged from RECIST 1.1. 
The most important change is to identify true disease progression, which is defined as subsequent increase in tumour burden after an examination with unconfirmed progressive disease. *LDi = longest diameter, **SPD = the sum of the product of perpendicular diameters for multiple lesions
Lugano Classification of malignant lymphoma:
The Lugano classification incorporates PET-CT for initial evaluation, staging and response assessment of malignant lymphoma. Contrast enhanced CT is used for staging low FDG-avid lymphomas or for more accurate measurements of nodal size in clinical trials, to discriminate between bowel and lymphadenopathy, assessing compression or thrombosis of vessels and for radiation planning. Measurable nodes must have a longest diameter (LDi) greater than 1.5 cm and measurable extranodal lesions must have a LDi greater than 1.0 cm. Bi-dimensional measurement of perpendicular diameters are noted for calculating the product of perpendicular diameters (PPD) and the sum of the product of perpendicular diameters for multiple lesions (SPD). Non-target disease includes the remaining measurable lesions (nodal and extranodal), spleen (> 13 cm vertical length) and non-measurable lesions (eg, smaller lesions, pleural and pericardial effusion, ascites). Modified Ann Arbor staging system Both Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma are staged according to a modified Ann Arbor classification. This staging system is based on the anatomical extent of disease and is divided into stages I-IV (see table). Patients with HL are subdivided according to the absence (A) or presence (B) of disease related symptoms (so called B symptoms), because this can influence the choice of therapy. Bulky disease can be a negative prognostic factor for some lymphomas. For HL it is defined as a single nodal mass ≥ 10 cm or > 1/3 transthoracic diameter at any level of thoracic vertebrae on CT. For NHL this definition is not unambiguously, a variety of sizes have been suggested for different subtypes.. Therefore, the recommendation for HL and NHL is to record the longest measurement on CT scan. CT image in a 28-year-old female with Hodgkin lymphoma stadium II ‘bulky’. Example bi-dimensional measurement with perpendicular diameters for calculating the sum of the product of perpendicular diameters for multiple lesions. CT images in a 56-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) before (a) and after (b) treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Coronal reconstructed CT images in the same patient show hepatosplenomegaly before (a) and normalization of hepatic and splenic size after (b) treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Splenomegaly is defined as a vertical length >13 cm. 
Hepatic size is not a reliable measure of hepatic involvement by lymphoma.
Response assessment:
For response assessment the SPD after treatment is compared to the SPD at baseline. 
Four response assessment categories are determined; complete remission (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) (table). To achieve CR no findings of lymphoma should be present, and all target nodes should have a LDi ≤ 1.5 cm. For PR the SPD of up to 6 target lesions should decrease ≥ 50%, there should be no increase in non-measured lesions and splenic size should be regressed > 50% in length beyond normal. SD is defined as < 50% decrease from baseline SPD of up to 6 target lesions. 
To meet the criteria for PD just a single target lesion should increase ≥ 50% in product of perpendicular diameters (PPD) from nadir (smallest PPD during treatment), splenomegaly progresses or occurs, clear progression of pre-existing non measurable lesions is determined or new lesions occur. Splitting and confluencing lesions When a lesion splits during follow-up examination, the individual product of the perpendicular diameters (PPDs) of the nodes should be summed together to represent the PPD of the split lesion. Likewise, if lesions become confluent, the PPD of the confluent mass should be compared with the sum of the PPDs of the individual nodes, with more than 50% increase in the PPD of the confluent mass compared with the sum of individual nodes necessary to indicate progressive disease.

Introduction:

Differential Diagnosis of bile duct dilatation:
Whenever there is bile duct dilatation, the first priority is to look for obstruction. Obstruction If there is an obstruction, we first look for gallstones in the bile duct.
If there are no gallstones involved, we then look for strictures. The differential diagnosis for a stricture is based on the location. No Obstruction Once we have excluded obstruction, we have to think about nonobstructive biliary diseases like:
Caroli Disease:
Saccular intrahepatic duct dilatation with normal sized choledochal duct in Caroli disease Caroli disease is an autosomal recessive disease secondary to the ductal plate malformation. It is associated with polycystic kidney disease, medullary sponge kidney and medullary cystic disease. So looking at the kidneys can sometimes help you make this diagnosis. On the left we see images of a patient with Caroli disease. Notice the intrahepatic duct dilatation and the normal caliber of the choledochal duct (extrahepatic bile duct). Saccular bile duct dilatation in Caroli disease The hallmark of Caroli disease is intrahepatic duct dilatation. The dilatation can be very large and saccular as seen in the case on the left or it can be very linear. Normal development of the ductal plate (Illustration by Aletta Frazier) Caroli Disease (2) The duct dilatation in Caroli disease is due to a congenital malformation of the ductal plate, which is the precursor of the intrahepatic bile ducts. On the left we see the normal development of the ductal plate. Embryologically each bile duct begins as a single layer of cells that surrounds a portal vein. This layer then duplicates. Portions of this double layer fuse and resorb leaving unfused portions that become the bile ducts. Abnormal development of the ductal plate(Illustration by Aletta Frazier) So in the normal situation each portal vein is surrounded by interconnecting bile ducts (left image). However if the patient has ductal plate malformation, the bile ducts are too numerous and they are ectatic (right image). Whether or not we see this on imaging depends on which portion of the bile ducts is affected. If the large ducts are involved, we see this as Caroli disease. However if only the very small ducts are involved, the result is congenital hepatic fibrosis. If all ducts are involved, then there is a combination of fibrosis and Caroli disease, which is also known as the Caroli syndrome. Central dot sign in Caroli disease
Central dot sign:
Most commonly the intrahepatic duct dilatation is segmental (83%) in distribution. The diffuse form is less common (17%). The shape of the dilatation is saccular in 76% or fusiform in 24% of the cases. A very important sign is the central dot sign. The central dot corresponds to the portal vein that is surrounded by dilated bile ducts. On the left we see a dot within the dilated ducts. When we put on the color doppler, we will notice that these structures contain blood flow and represent portal veins. Central dot sign in Caroli disease Caroli Disease (3) On the left CT-images of the same patient. Notice the central dot sign and the segmental involvement. This patient has cirrhosis with splenomegaly due to portal hypertension. Extrahepatic duct dilatation is present in 53% of cases, secondary to cholangitis and stone or sludge passage. These are secondary findings, that are not part of the primary disease. When there is extensive fibrosis, these patients can develop cirrhosis over time. ERCP: Caroli disease with severe intrahepatic duct dilatation. No obstruction. Mild dilatation of the choledochal duct due to cholangitis Caroli Disease (4) The cholangiogram is important in the work up of these patients, because obstruction has to be excluded. This can be done with MRCP or ERCP, as is shown on the left. There was no sign of obstruction. The mild dilatation of the choledochal duct was the result of cholangitis. Study the image on the left. Then continue reading. There is focal dilatation with intermixing strictures of the bile ducts in segment IV (arrow). The other bile ducts and the choledochal duct are normal. In some of the cases of Caroli disease the imaging findings may simulate a cystic neoplasm as is seen in the case on the left. This case was originally diagnosed as a biliary cystadenoma. However, the gross specimen demonstrates dilated bile ducts and ductal plate malformation was present microscopically. Caroli disease with intraductal stone formation Caroli Disease (5): Complications Patient with Caroli disease are usually brought to our attention, when they develop complications. These complications are commonly the result of biliary stasis, which leads to stone formation and infection. Complications: On the left a patient with dilated bile ducts with intraductal stones (arrow) Study the image on the left. Then continue reading. The findings are: The mass in the right lobe of the liver turned out to be an abscess. Remember that liver abscesses in the early phase can look quite solid. In the differential diagnosis we would also have to include a neoplasm, because patients with Caroli disease have an increased risk of developing a cholangiocarcinoma. Cirrhosis in a patient with Caroli disease Ultimately if there is substantial fibrosis and the entire liver is involved, these patients develop cirrhosis. The patient on the left developed severe liver failure and a resection was performed. Notice the intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, splenomegaly and dilated venous collaterals. In the resected specimen there is a central dot sign (blue arrow) and a small pus collection (yellow arrow). LEFT: Infiltrating cholangiocarcinoma with stricture in a patient with Caroli disease RIGHT: Intraductal cholangiocarcinoma Cholangiocarcinoma can take on many forms in patients with Caroli disease. The cholangiogram on the left demonstrates a focal stricture (blue arrow), which turned out to be a infiltrating cholangiocarcinoma. The patient on the right has a cholangiocarcinoma in which the tumor was filling up the dilated ducts (yellow arrow).
Choledochal cyst:
A choledochal cyst is a congenital dilatation of the extrahepatic bile duct.
These patients do not have a ductal plate abnormality.
The most common theory for the development of a choledochal cyst is that the dilatation is due to an underlying anomalous pancreatico-biliary junction. In the anomalous junction the biliary and pancreatic duct join proximal to the sphincter of Oddi. In these patients there is a long common channel. The theory is that when the sphincter of Oddi contracts, pancreatic enzymes will flow into the bile duct and causing dilatation and in some cases, narrowing of the distal duct. Todani Classification of choledochal cysts
Todani Classification:
This classification classifies the choledochal cysts into 5 cathegories. Type V, which is not shown on the left is Caroli disease. We now know, that Caroli is a different disease. Type I is a true choledichal cyst with focal dilatation of the extrahepatic duct. This is the most frequent type (90-95% of the cases). Type IV is also a true choledichal cyst with dilatation of the entire extrahepatic duct with involvement of portions of the intrahepatic ducts. The intrahepatic ducts taper normally to the periphery, indicating that there is no obstruction. Type II and III are extremely rare and it is debatable whether or not these are true choledochal cysts. Type II is a diverticulum of the extrahepatic duct and many believe that this entity is not related to an anomalous pancreatico-biliary junction. Type III is a choledochocele, where there is dilatation of the distal part of the bile duct. These patients also have a normal pancreaticobiliary junction. Type IV choledochal cyst Choledochal cyst (2) On the left a patient with dilatation of both the extrahepatic duct and part of the intrahepatic ducts. So this is a type IV. Notice that the peripheral ducts are normal, so this is not an obstructive pattern. Type IV choledochal cyst On the left another type IV choledochal cyst. There is dilatation of the extrahepatic duct, cystic duct and a small portion of the left hepatic duct. There is no intrahepatic dilatation. Cholangiocarcinoma within a choledocha cyst Choledochal cyst (3) There is an association of bile duct adenocarcinoma and choledochal cysts. These carcinomas can occur within the choledochal cyst, like the case on the left, or in the gallbladder or anywhere else in the biliary ducts. In the bile ducts they can present as classic peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, Klatskin tumor or distal cholangiocarcinoma.
Recurrent Pyogenic Cholangitis (RPC):
Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis. Illustration by Heike Blum. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis is an uncommon disease in the western world. Most of these cases are seen in Asian countries. The etiology is unknown, although some of these patients have biliary parasites. The disease is characterized by the presence of intrahepatic pigmented stones and recurrent infection. These patients are also at risk of developing biliary cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis of the left lobe with intrahepatic stones The left lobe is the most common location of the disease due to the delayed drainage of the left system. On the left a typical case. There is focal dilatation of the bile ducts in the left lobe with stones. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis with resected specimen Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (2) On the left another example of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis. There is intrahepatic lithiasis with focal diatation. A case like this is indistinguishable from focal Caroli disease with secundary stone formation.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis:
Primary sclerosing cholangitis: MRCP and ERCP When we see intrahepatic bile duct dilatation with strictures and only mild dilatation, the first diagnosis we think of is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We know however that there is a long differential diagnistic list which includes: The case on the left nicely demonstrates the bile duct strictures. Notice that there is only mild dilatation, which is common in PSC. Primary sclerosing cholangitis with strictures both in the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Illustration by Heike Blum The hallmark of PSC is strictures, but early on in the disease the strictures can be difficult to appreciate. The underlying abnormality in PSC is fibrosis, which is of unknown etiology. PSC is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis in up to 70% of patients, but it can also be associated with Crohn's disease of the large intestine. The reason for the association with IBD is unknown, but it is thought to be the result of an immune response. Chronic inflammation surrounding a bile duct in PSC Primary sclerosing cholangitis (2) On the far left a histologic specimen demonstrating chronic inflammation surrounding the bile duct. The gross specimen demonstrates the thickening of the wall of the bile duct (arrow) causing many strictures. The strictures in PSC are short in the order of 3-5 mm in length, which is helpful to remember because if you are looking for cholangiocarcinoma, the malignant strictures usually exceed 10 mm in length. PSC with thickening of the wall of the bile duct (arrow)
Ultrasound findings:
One of the earliest features in PSC is on sonography where we see thickening of the wall of the bile duct as is seen in the image on the left. This patient came for an ultrasound examination to rule out gallstones. Notice that the intrahepatic ducts are normal. The differential diagnosis would include PSC, AIDS-cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. A cholangiocarcinoma would be rather unlikely, because there is no obstruction. Continue with the CT. PSC with thickening of the wall of the bile duct (arrow)
CT findings:
On the CT the liver looks quite normal. However if you look at the common bile duct in the pancreatic head you will notice the soft tissue density. The differential diagnosis would include an impacted stone or cholangiocarcinoma, but since this patient had no obstruction, it was thought to be the result of bile wall thickening. The gallbladder wall is also thickened. Primary sclerosing cholangitis. CT findings Primary sclerosing cholangitis (3) On the left a patient with more severe disease. We can see mild bile duct dilatation with a discontinuous pattern. Primary sclerosing cholangitis. CT findings On the left a patient with more pronounced CT findings. Study the image and then continue reading. The findings are: Primary sclerosing cholangitis. late CT findings Primary sclerosing cholangitis (4) Late CT features are seen on the images on the left. Study the images and then continue reading. The findings are: Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Cholangiographic findings Cholangiography is used in the initial diagnosis of the disease, when there are only subtle strictures and in patients known with PSC to look for new strictures that are suspicious for carcinoma. On cholangiography we can see: Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Cholangiographic findings On the left the typical findings in PSC. Notice the diverticula on the image on the right. Diverticula are very specific for the diagnosis PSC. So when you see these diverticula, you should immediately search for subtle strictures in the intrahepatic ducts. MRCP in PSC. There is a long stricture suspective of cholangiocarcinoma (arrow) Primary sclerosing cholangitis (5) On the left a MRCP in a pateint with PSC. Notice the large stricture, which is quite worriesome for cholagiocarcinoma (arrow). The strictures in PSC show an abrupt transission, while here we see 'shouldering', which indicates mass-efect. In addition there is intrahepatic dilatation proximal to this stenotic area. MRCP and ERCP in a patient with a stricture at the hilum On the left a MRCP in a patient demonstrating a stricture at the level of the hilum. On MRCP this stricture looked long and worriesome for cholangiocarcinoma. However, on the ERCP, the ducts have been distended with contrast and we can see that this is a short stricture compatible with the diagnosis of PSC. During follow up this proved to be just PSC.
Cholangiocarcinoma:
Normal columnar epithelium (left) transforms into adenocarcinoma (right) Cholangiocarcinoma (i.e., adenocarcinoma of the bile duct) arises from the columnar epithelium of the bile duct. It is characterized by malignant glands within a desmoplastic stroma. These tumors have an infiltrative growth pattern and do not have a capsule. Typical locations of cholangiocarcinoma. There are four basic patterns of chlangiocarcinoma: (illustration on the left). Cholangiocarcinoma is an uncommon tumor, that is mostly seen in patients with underlying benign bilairy disease. The incidence in the U.S. is 2000 to 2500 cases per year (coloncancer 150.000 per year). In Asian countries the incidence is ten times greater due to more chronic biliary infection. High risk groups are patients with: Clinical presentation: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. RadPath correlation
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma:
These arise in the very small peripheral ducts. These tumors have abundant fibrous stroma that can cause retraction of the liver capsule. The tumor typically enhances in the equilibrium and delayed phases (5-10 minutes). Read more about intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Liver : Masses Part II : common liver tumors Early and late phase enhancement of a intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma Although these tumors are usually quite heterogeneous because the contrast uptake is delayed and can be irregular. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Capsular retraction and the late enhancement The key findings to look for are: On the left a typical case. Notice the capsular retraction (blue arrow) and the late enhancement (yellow arrow). Intraductal Cholangiocarcinoma
Intraductal Cholangiocarcinoma:
These are very rare tumors. They present as a intrabiliary mass with biliary dilatation peripheral to the mass. Klatskin Tumor with dilatation of bile ducts in the right and left lobe of the liver Illustration by Heike Blum
Klatskin Tumor - Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma:
The most common site of biliary adenocarcinoma is at or near the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. These tumors are also known as Klatskin tumors. Klatskin tumors have an aggressive biologic behavior. Imaging features: On the left a nice correlation between an illustration and a sonographic image of a Klatskin tumor. Notice how ill-defined the tumor is. Klatskin Tumor. Barely visible. Stent in situ (arrow) On CT these tumors can be very difficult to visualize. Many of these patients already have a stent in place when they first come to CT which makes it even harder (figure). Klatskin Tumor: arterial and portal venous phase Klatskin Tumor (2) In the case on the left we can identify the tumor at the confluens of the left and right hepatic duct. The margins of the tumor however are imperceptible because of the infiltrative growth. Based on the CT it is not possible to stage the tumor correctly. Hiar Cholagiocarcinoma. Notice the superiority of ERCP to MRCP. The image on the right nicely demonstrates the shouldering at the hilum and the multiple strictures. In these tumors it may be difficult to get a definitive diagnosis pre-operatively. Biopsy is almost impossible and results of endoscopic brushing are commonly negative. The staging is done with cholangiography and is based on the finding of mass effect (shouldering), irregular margins and abrupt tapering at the obstruction. The limitations of MRCP in staging are the spatial resolution and the inability in the evaluation of the secondary ducts. ERCP is superior to MRCP (figure) Klatskin Tumor (3) : Resectability These tumors are unresectable when: Bismuth-Corlette type I tumor with abrupt stricture and shouldering below the confluens
Klatskin Tumor - Bismuth-classification:
Bismuth-Corlette type I A type I tumor is a lesion limited of the common hepatic duct, i.e. below the confluence. These patients can undergo resection with bile duct recontruction because the confluence is normal. Bismuth-Corlette type II tumor with extention into the origin of the right and left hepatic duct. Bismuth-Corlette type II A type II tumor is a lesion that extends to the confluence. These tumors are potentially resectable Bismuth-Corlette type III Klatskin-tumor Bismuth-Corlette type IIIa and IIIb A IIIa-tumor extends into the right and a IIIb-tumor extends into the left hepatic duct. Bismuth-Corlette type IIIa Klatskin-tumor On the left PTC-images of a type IIIa-tumor.
The arrow indicates the extention into the right hepatic duct. The left duct is normal. This patient can undergo a resection of the right lobe of the liver. Bismuth-Corlette type IV Klatskin-tumor Bismuth-Corlette type IV On the left an illustration and ERCP of a type IV-tumor with extention into the right and left duct. A type IV tumor is unresectable.

Appendicitis - Pitfalls in US and CT diagnosis:
Julien Puylaert and Julie Tutein Nolthenius
HMC, the Hague and Amsterdam UMC; East Kent Hospitals, Canterbury, UK:
Publicationdate 2020-7-11 In this chapter we will deal with the optimal diagnostic strategy in patients with suspected appendicitis, and the pitfalls leading to a false-positive or false-negative diagnosis. Special attention will be given to: For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com
Diagnostic strategy in suspected appendicitis:
The policy in patients with an acute abdomen in the Netherlands has a well-established scientific basis (Table) (Lameris et al. BMJ 2009;338: b2431). CRP and WBC as well as clinical impression, play an important role in choosing between complementary CT scan and watchful waiting.
First US, than CT.:
Patients with suspected appendicitis are relatively young, and it seems reasonable to begin with US in most patients. In this 11-week pregnant woman, US confirmed an intact intra-uterine pregnancy as well as acute appendicitis. 
Note the different cm-scales. Laparoscopic  removal of the inflamed appendix  was successful.
CT if inconclusive US:
In most patients with an inconclusive US and a high suspicion of appendicitis, CT is the next step. 
A fortunate circumstance for CT, is that these patients are often obese. 
CT is principally performed with i.v. contrast. If there is serious pain in elderly patients with a wide differential diagnosis, triphasic CT and even CT-thorax, can be added. In our hospital of all patients who undergo CT for acute abdomen, in about 15 % a CT thorax is ordered within 24 hours, and vice versa. In case of renal impairment, CT without contrast may be diagnostic as in these three patients. If CT without contrast is non-diagnostic, repeat CT with iv contrast after correction of renal function. Table. Results of combined US/CT findings, the report and the ensuing policy When both US and CT are done, it is important to integrate US and CT findings into a combined report. The combination of US with optional CT, is highly accurate for appendicitis, and is inconclusive  in less than 1% of high-suspicion patients (maybe 2 to 3 patients per year in our hospital). Repeat US and/or CT and also diagnostic laparoscopy are then helpful.
First CT than US:
When for some reason CT scan is chosen as primary investigation, US after CT can also be useful. In this elderly lady with atypical abdominal pain and renal insufficiency, a non-contrast CT  revealed a dubiously inflamed appendix. Focused US with a high-frequency probe confirmed that the ventrally located appendix was inflamed. In this obese patient, CT identified a deeply located, possibly inflamed appendix (arrow) at a distance of 11 cms from the skin. Focused US with graded compression reduced this distance to < 3 cms, allowing the use of a high frequency probe, which  showed a non-compressible, inflamed appendix (arrow). In this young man the appendix could not be identified on CT scan due to lack of intra-abdominal fat. US easily demonstrated a normal appendix.
False-negative diagnosis:

US non-visualization of the appendix: tricks and tips:
The most important reason for a false-negative ultrasound examination is overlooking the inflamed appendix. 
The greatest problem is non-visualization of the appendix. In adult patients, the numbers are as follows (Table). In expe­rienced hands the inflamed appendix can be visualized in 80-90% of patients with acute appendicitis. Hereunder the pitfalls leading to non-visualization and how to avoid them.
Retrocecal appendicitis:
The appendix is usually found at the spot of maximum tenderness. In retrocecal appendicitis (arrow) the cecum is often pushed medially with the US probe, so that the appendix (arrow) appears to be localized lateral to the cecum than behind it. Another possibility to visualize the appendix in retrocecal appendicitis is positioning of the probe in the right flank, thereby avoiding the gas and feces-filled cecum. Another trick in retrocecal appendicitis is to push the inflamed appendix (arrow) with your left hand in the direction of the probe. To find the appendix, it may be useful at first to identify the ileocecal valve (see also US of the GI tract: normal anatomy). The base of the appendix is usually found 3 centimeters caudally, where it leaves the cecal pole at the medial side. The biggest problem for US  is a deep pelvic location of the appendix. In this pregnant, obese woman, a possible inflamed appendix (arrow with question mark) was visualized during forceful compression deep down in the pelvis. Subsequent transvaginal US  showed a pus-filled, inflamed appendix within 1 cm of the vaginal probe. Appendicitis with air in the lumen Air in the lumen can make it difficult to identify the inflamed appendix (arrowheads). The echolucent wall and the surrounding inflamed fat (*), make clear that appendicitis is present. Tip appendicitis. a and v = iliac artery and vein Another pitfall is tip-appendicitis, where the inflammation is confined to the distal tip. If only the normal, proximal part (arrows in A) is visualized, and the distal end  (arrows in B) would have been obscured by bowel gas, a false-negative diagnosis may be the result. (a and v = iliac artery and vein) The presence of a genera­li­zed, paralytic ileus is suspect for perfo­rated appen­dici­tis, and if the inflamed appendix cannot be visua­lized, CT is mandatory, also to exclude other conditions. This 66-year old man presented with excruciating abdominal pain with generalized peritonitis and a CRP of 550. 
US revealed only dilated small bowel, CT was done for suspected mesenteric ischemia. CT demonstrated appendicitis (arrow) with a perforated tip and four-quadrant contamination of the peritoneal cavity.
Mistaking an inflamed appendix for a normal appendix:
In 7 % of patients with appendicitis, the inflamed appendix has a US diameter of less than 7 mm. If there is hypervascularity and inflamed fat and the patient has mild symptoms, this is usually a case of spontaneously resolving appendicitis (see Appendicitis: US findings). This young man had a rapidly subsiding symptoms at the time of US, with CRP 1 and WBC 9. Surgery was nevertheless performed and histology confirmed ordinary, acute appendicitis. Perforated appendix with normal diameter In advanced appendicitis, the inflamed appendix (arrow) may have a very small diameter, because it has emptied itself into an abscess. In these two cases, the secondary US findings of puscollections and inflamed fat, give away the correct diagnosis.
Incorrect diagnosis of an alternative condition:
In some patients, US findings may suggest an alternative condition, while in fact appendicitis is present. 
This is obviously a dangerous pitfall. Acute appendicitis with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes In this 16 year old patient with RLQ pain, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes surrounded by some inflamed fat (*) were the only US finding and the appendix could not be identified. CT confirmed the enlarged nodes (arrowheads), but revealed an inflamed appendix (arrow), originating from the cecum in deep pelvic position. Young patients with acute appendicitis often have secondarily enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Mesenteric lymphadenitis
Mesenteric lymphadenitis:
If enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are the only US findings in a young patient with RLQ pain, the diagnosis of viral mesenteric lymphadenitis can be considered. It is however mandatory to identify the normal appendix (arrow) with certainty, because enlarged nodes can be secondary to appendicitis.
Infectious ileocecitis / ileocolitis:
Another pitfall is when secondary wall thickening of ileum or right colon is visualized, but the underlying appendicitis is overlooked. In this patient initially the submucosal colonic wall thickening was interpreted as infectious ileocolitis by Campylobacter or Salmonella. Positioning of the probe in the right flank, revealed the inflamed appendix (arrow) surrounded by inflamed fat (*).
The presence of inflamed fat in itself is a key finding, because this is never found in infectious colitis. Appendicitis (arrow) causing secondary thickening of the neighboring ileum.(A and V= iliac artery and vein) In these two patients initially the mucosal thickening of the terminal ileum as a sole US finding was interpreted as Crohn’s ileitis or infectious ileitis. A second US exam revealed the underlying appendicitis (arrow) causing secondary thickening of the neighboring ileum. Acute appendicitis and right ovarian cyst. (v= iliac vein)
Right ovarian cyst:
Another pitfall is the erroneous diagnosis of an alternative gynecological condition, while in fact appendicitis is present. In this young woman, a conspicuous hemorrhagic right ovarian cyst (arrowheads) was visualized and held responsible for her RLQ symptoms. Further searching however revealed acute appendicitis, the cyst being a confusing coincidental finding.
Cecal diverticulitis:
In this patient young patient with cecal diverticulitis the most prominent fat stranding (arrowheads) is found around a cecal diverticulum, containing a fecolith (*). The appendix (arrow) is secondarily inflamed due to the nearby cecal diverticulitis. Complete cure with conservative treatment.
Epiploic appendagitis:
This 39-year old man had 24 hours of pain in the RLQ  with severe local peritonitis, clinically very suspect for acute appendicitis. He had an important business flight to Taiwan the next morning. US shows a 7 mm not well compressible appendix (arrow) with inflamed fat (arrowheads), which was located medially, rather than surrounding the appendix. Continue with next images... Epiploic appendagitis. Click for animation. During intermittent graded compression, the inflamed fat could be pushed away from the appendix. Click image for animation. Continue with next images... Epiploic appendagitis CT confirmed a normal appendix surrounded by normal fat and an adjacent, a small epiploic appendagitis (arrowhead). He was reassured, was given painkillers and caught his flight to Taiwan the next morning. This patient also underlines the observation that, in epiploic appendagitis, there is no relation between size and the degree of local peritonitis. So, in epiploic appendagitis size does not matter. Epiploic appendagitis This 41-year old male had severe local peritonitis in the RLQ. The longitudinal US image showed a concentrically layered ovoid structure (arrowheads) surrounded by inflamed fat (*), suggestive for an inflamed appendix. In the transverse plane however the US image structure was also ovoid (arrowheads). Subsequent CT scan demonstrated that  the ovoid structure in fact was a small infarcted epiploic appendage. CT also identified  the normal appendix (arrows). Epiploic appendagitis This was a 73-year old lady with severe RLQ pain, CRP  and a local, not well described area of inflamed fat (arrowheads). CT confirmed a small epiploic appendagitis (arrowheads) and a normal appendix (arrows). Again, no relation between local pain symptoms and size of the infarcted epiploic appendage. Omental infarction
False-positive US diagnosis:
In young children, the normal appendix may be large due to very prominent lymphoid hyperplasia of the deep mucosa. In this 6-year old, asymptomatic child a large appendix was seen. Notice that you can identify the normal anatomical layers of the appendix.
Crohn’s disease:
Mistaking a normal for an inflamed appendix may also occur if there is secondary thickening of the appendix associ­ated with another condition. These images, though 30 years old, are still illustrative.
In this young man with suspected appendicitis both  ileum and appendix (arrow) were thickened, due to ileocecal Crohn disease, also affecting the appendix. Barium study confirms Crohn ileitis and shows irregular filling of the appendix, proving that this is a case of non-obstructive Crohn appendicitis. Variable involvement of the appendix (arrow) in ileocecal Crohn disease: This patient with pain RLQ,  had a complicated appendectomy with abscess formation 4 years earlier, with intermittent symptoms afterwards. Now US shows a Crohn ileitis with a fistula (*) in the direction of the cecal pole. 
CT and bariumstudy confirm Crohn ileitis (arrowheads) and a fistula (arrow)  from the ileum to the cecal pole. After ileocecal resection, he remained symptom free for at least 15 years.
Cecal carcinoma:
In cecal carcinoma, atypical clinical findings may lead to serious delay, because the erroneous diagnosis of “appendiceal mass” is made. US and CT findings may add to the confusion, by showing mucinous dilatation of the appendix due to obstructive ingrowth of tumour in the appendix base. Tumour-based obstruction rarely leads to full-blown appendicitis. Enable Scroll

Normal appendix mistaken for appendicitis:
A false positive diagnosis can be made if the normal appendix is mistaken for an inflamed one. Of all normal appendices, 7 % is larger than 7 mm (see US of the GI tract). Clinical presentation and the presence / absence of inflamed fat are the most decisive features. In doubtful cases like in this patient in whom an 8 mm appendix with dubious inflamed fat (*)  was visualized including the blind end (arrowheads), clinical follow-up and repeated US the next day is a safe policy. 
Try to convince the surgeon, that an appendix like this will not rupture overnight. If the patient is painful with a high CRP, CT should be the next step, especially to exclude other conditions. Epiploic appendagitis
Omental infarction:
Images of a 6-year old boy with three days of progressive painin the RLQ, WBC 11 and CRP 80. US showed free fluid, a normal sized appendix (arrows) and a large mass of inflamed fat (arrowheads) with minimal peripheral vascularization. Clinical and US features were erroneously interpreted as possible perforated appendicitis. At surgery a normal appendix was removed as well as a firm mass originating from the omentum. Diagnosis: segmental omental infarction. This condition should have been treated conservatively. Omental infarction Images of a previously healthy 50 years old man, who experienced progressive pain right of the umbilicus.
Lab: WBC 10, CRP 33. 
Appendicitis was suspected. US showed large, cake-like mass of inflamed fat (arrowheads) with ventrally, echolucent thickening of the peritoneum. 
The appendix was not identified. CT confirmed omental infarction (arrowheads) and a normal appendix (arrow), surrounded by some fat stranding, associated with the omental infarction. Recovery without treatment.
Acute pancreatitis:
Many other conditions may cause secondary thickening of the appendix.
Detection of the underlying condition by US or CT is then mandatory. This obese lady presented with RLQ pain, a CRP of 80 and a normal serum amylase. US identified a 6 mm appendix (arrows) with severe local tenderness. CT scan revealed acute pancreatitis with retroperitoneal fluid (*) descending to the RLQ, explaining the patient’s symptoms mimicking appendicitis. The pancreatic exudate (*) approaches the appendix (arrow) closely.
Abnormal location of the appendix:
Courtesy Dr. Netter The appendix base most often lies near McBurney’s point.
However there is a wide variation in location of the cecum and also in the orientation of the appendix (figure). An inguinal hernia containing the appendix, is named Amyand’s hernia. In case of an abnormal position of the inflamed appendix far from McBurney’s point, it is useful to indicate the location of the appendix on the skin with a waterproof pencil. This may influence site, size and orientation of the incision and also the choice for laparoscopic appendectomy. In this 30-week pregnant lady with early appendicitis (arrow), the drawing enabled the surgeon to perform a small incision, exactly over the appendix base. In this young man the acute RUQ pain was explained by an inflamed appendix (arrow) in unusual high position. Note the distance  from McBurney’s point (dot). The appendix was laparoscopically removed. Appendix in unusual location This patient was clinically suspected of pyelonephritis. On the spot of maximum tenderness with the probe in intercostal position, an inflamed appendix (arrow) was visualized. CT confirmed the unusual location (arrows). A successful laparoscopic appendectomy was done. Appendix in unusual location Two patients with unusual clinical presentation due to unusual location of the inflamed appendix (arrows) in the left upper quadrant (left panel) and at the level of the umbilicus (right panel) This 58-year old female presented with a slightly painful mass in the groin since two weeks and a low CRP. US revealed an incarcerated, edematous  appendix (arrow) surrounded by non-compressible fat in a femoral hernia (Amyand hernia). Hernioplasty was done, the appendix was not resected. CT scan, performed for other reasons 17 years later (patient now 75 years), showed the appendix (arrows), still doing fine. This patient with severe COPD presented with a painful mass in the right groin, suspect for incarcerated hernia or a purulent lymphadenitis. 
CRP was 110. US revealed a puscollection and an inflamed appendix (arrow) within a femoral hernial sac, confirmed by CT. In view of his comorbidity, only abscess drainage was performed, with success. 
Uneventful recovery thereafter.

“Foie appendiculaire”:
Nowadays exceedingly rare, the so-called “foie appendiculaire” was a feared complication in the pre-antibiotic era. This patient had longstanding appendicitis with multiple abscesses, one of them containing a fecolith (arrow). In the portal vein a septic thrombus (arrowheads) is visualized while there are many, small, ill-defined liver abscesses (*).
Early complications after appendectomy:

Post-operative abscess:
Post-operative abscesses can be seen, even after uncomplicated appendectomy for non-perforated appendicitis. In wound abscess there is little role for US and CT,  in contrast to their role in intra-abdominal abscesses. This 25 year old woman presented ten days after surgery for perforated appendicitis with fever. She had a Douglas abscess, lying close to the rectum (r.) showing a thickened wall. Vaginal US confirmed the abscess and secondary rectal wall thickening. At the spot of closest contact (*) the wall layers of the rectum were locally obliterated. Follow-up vaginal US showed complete, spontaneous transrectal evacuation. A 9-year-old, with persistent RLQ pain and painful micturition, two weeks after appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. 
CRP 220. He was not very ill. US shows a large, irregularly defined Douglas abscess with reactive thickening of the bladder wall (**). He had a few days of smelly stool (spontaneous evacuation of pus to the rectum) and made a full recovery without antibiotics or surgery.
Late complications after appendectomy:
Late complications after appendectomy are shown in the table.
Stump-appendicitis:
This patient underwent a difficult appendectomy for longstanding appendicitis, resulting in a so-called “hockeystick-prolongation” of the McBurney incision, complicated by post-OR abscesses. Three years later, he presented with pain in the RLQ and elevated WBC and CRP. US revealed a 4 cm long, inflamed appendix: stump-appendicitis. Surgery confirmed inflammation of  a 4 cm appendix stump. Apparently the appendix was not completely removed during the initial operation. Stump-appendicitis is more often seen: If small and close to the cecum, conservative management is possible just like in cecum diverticulitis. Stump appendicitis This is a 34-year-old woman with mild clinical signs of appendicitis and a CRP of 125.
US was inconclusive. CT showed a small stump appendicitis containing a fecolith. At surgery the stump could only be removed by stapling-off part of the cecal pole. In hindsight, conservative management would have been a good alternative, as the fecolith probably would have evacuated spontaneously to the cecal lumen. Stump appendicitis Eight months after a complicated appendectomy with open wound healing, this 52-year-old woman had pain in the RLQ. US and CT revealed a 2 cm stump appendicitis (arrows). Note also the large cicatricial hernia, as a late result of the infected operation wound.
Small bowel obstruction due to adhesions:

Head Neck tumors - When to think of malignancy:

Look for red flags:
Frank Pameijer
Radiology Department of the University Medical Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2023-06-23 Benign head neck tumors are common, while malignant tumors
are rare. The question is, when do we need to think of a malignant
tumor, since many radiologists will not frequently be confronted with a
malignant tumor. In this article we provide you with some red flags, that may help
you to recognize the occasional malignant lesion in daily practice.
Introduction:
In the table you will find the red flags, that makes the lesion suspicious for malignancy, although there are exceptions where benign lesions may also show red flags.
More red flegs means more suspicious. We will discuss all these items in the next chapters.
Growth pattern:
The table shows the different etiologies between lesions with a destructive versus an expansile pattern A destructive growth pattern means full thickness break of mineralized bone.
This is most frequently seen in malignant tumors, but also in aggressive benign tumors and inflammation. Expansile growth pattern means that there is a balance between the activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.
This is less frequently seen in malignant lesions, but common in benign neoplasms and chronic inflammation.
Mucocele:
These images are of a 47-year old male, who complained of tension in his forehead. First look at the images.
What are the findings?
Is the lesion expansile or destructive or both? Then continue reading... Findings: MRI was performed to confirm the most likely diagnosis of a mucocele... The MRI shows an expansile lesion with only rim enhancement. There is no enhancement within the lesion. This confirms the diagnosis of a mucocele. A mucocele is a cystic lesion filled with mucous. It develops when the opening of (part of) a paranasal sinus
becomes obstructed. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the MRI images. Here more examples of mucocele. There is complete fill with soft tissue (i.e. mucus) as well
as expansion with intact bony margins of the sinus.
2. Frontal sinus mucocele. Sometimes, thinning of the bony margin is present simulating destruction. On
thin CT-slices it is usually possible to see the intact bony structure.
3. Mucocele of an anterior ethmoid sinus cell.
4. Right sphenoid sinus mucocele. The intersphenoidal septum is expanded over the
midline.
5. Frontal sinus mucocele.
6. Mucocele of the right ethmoid sinus with thinning and expansion of the
lamina papyracea into the ipsilateral orbit. Mucocele versus Retention cyst In order to fulfill the criteria for mucocele, there has to
be both complete fill-in as well as expansion of a sinus. Image This patient has a mucocele in the left maxillary sinus with
a little bit of expansion (white arrow). On the right there is a mass without expansion (yellow
arrowhead) and there is still some air in the maxillary sinus. This is a retention cyst. Image
This patient also has a mucocele in the left maxillary sinus.
On the right there is a complete fill in of the maxillary sinus, but no expansion . 
Therefore it does not fullfill the criteria for the diagnosis of a mucocele. The most common site of a mucocele is the lower lip. 
Other
locations include the oral cavity. 
If the lesion originates from the obstructed
sublingual gland, it is called a ranula.
Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma:
These images are of a 75-year old male who complains of a stuffy nose and bleeding from the nose. First look at the images.
Continue with the coronal reconstructions... Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images. What are the findings?
Is the lesion expansile or destructive (red flag)?
Is there another red flag? Then continue reading... The two red flags are: In patients with rhinosinusitis there may be expansion and
even sometimes bony destruction, but the disease is (almost) always bilateral. Continue with the MRI... On these STIR-images you can see the difference in signal
intensity between the obstructed maxillary and ethmoid sinuses (black arrows)
and the tumor (white arrows). In patients with a mucocele the entire lesion would have had the
same signal intensity unlike  this case. On the diffusion images the lesion has a high signal
intensity on b1000. On ADC, the lesion has a very low signal intensity, even
lower that brain tissue, indicative of marked restriction. 
This means that we
are dealing with a hypercellular tumor. This is a third red flag. On the CT you might get the impression that the tumor also involves the frontal sinus (black arrow).
However on the MRI we can clearly see that the frontal sinus is only obstructed and has a higher signal intensity (white arrow) compared to the tumor in the ethmoid sinuses (yellow arrows). The final conclusion is: Biopsy showed a sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC), which has a very poor prognosis.
The patient was treated with resection and post-operative radiotherapy and to our surprise there is no sign of recurrence after four years.
Squamous cell carcinoma:
Here another example of a lesion with a destructive growth
pattern. Notice the tumor enhancement on the MRI (arrow). There is invasion of the (medial) orbit. Biopsy showed a squamous cell carcinoma.
Localization:
In the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses the most common diseases are sinusitis and polyposis.
These diseases are almost always bilateral. Any disease which is unilateral, should raise the question: could this be a malignant tumor?
Adenocarcinoma:
This is a patient who complains of obstructive nasal
congestion. Now, if you would only report this case as subtotal
opacification of the paranasal sinuses on the right, the treating physician could
would be inclined to think, that it is (just another case of) ordinary
sinusitis. As we have discussed before, the red flag here is the
unilateral localization of the abnormality. A unilateral sinusitis is extremely uncommon. and if you look carefully, there is destruction of the nasal
septum, which is a second red flag. Continue with the MRI... The MRI-images show a unilateral tumor in the right nasal cavity with obstruction of frontal sinus and to a lesser degree also of the maxillary sinus. There is diffusion restriction (high on DWI and low on ADC), which is the third red flag. Biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma.
The patient was treated with resection followed by proton radiation and is now disease-free for 14 months. Case courtesy B.M. Verbist, Leiden
Inverted papilloma:
Here another unilateral tumor.
The enhancing tumor has a higher signal intensity compared to the obstructed maxillary sinus.
Notice that the tumor has a lobulated border.
This is frequently seen in inverted papillomas, but is not highly specific and anyhow a biopsy has to be performed. Final diagnosis: inverted papilloma. This is another inverted papilloma. It presents as a lobulated mucosal mass with a ‘cerebriform’ appearance. As if we are looking at gyri (arrowheads). 
This finding is somewhat specific for inverted papilloma Next to a malignant lesion, another cause of unilateral paranasal obstruction has to be kept in mind.
This is illustrated in this case. This is a 62-year old female patient. 
CT sinus was requested by the otolaryngologist. Clinical information: ‘chronic unilateral sinusitis’. Images
There is a soft tissue obliteration of the right maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinus (a so-called ‘infundibular pattern’). 
As discussed above, this is a red flag. Look at the following images and try to decide if there is a malignant lesion causing the infundibular pattern (or is there another cause?) Images
There are periapical lucencies around the roots of a right upper molar indicative of dental infection (black arrowheads).
Compare to the normal left side on the axial image (white arrowhead). 
Further clinical examination excluded a malignant lesion.
The patient was referred for dental evaluation because a dental infection may well be the cause of a unilateral chronic sinusitis. Note: For this reason, it is crucial to include the maxilla in the field of view of a sinus CT.
Vascularization:
As a single feature,
vascularity is not very specific in the discrimination between benign and
malignant in head and neck tumors. 
But in combination with other imaging
features, it can be quite helpful in the differential diagnosis. Think of the
strong enhancement and flow voids on MR in glomus tumors (paragangliomas) in
combination with the localization (i.e. from the carotid bifurcation up to the
jugular foramen). In any vascular lesion in the head-neck region we should check:
Rhabdomyosarcoma:
These images are of a 16-year old male with proptosis and
nasal bleeding. First study the images. Look for red flags. Then continue reading. Based on the CT examination in another hospital there was a
suspicion of a juvenile angiofibroma, which is a hypervascular locally
aggressive tumor in young males with severe nasal bleedings, that can be
life-threathening. On these images there is a destructive lesion with invasion
of the orbita. A juvenile angiofibroma always originates from the posterior
nasal cavity and is centered around the sphenopalatine foramen and pterygopalatine fossa. Continue with the additional images... Pterygopalatine fossa The pterygopalatine fossa is an inverted pyramidal-shaped, fat-filled space located on the lateral side of the skull, between the infratemporal fossa and the nasopharynx. It is a major neurovascular crossroad between the orbit, the nasal cavity, the nasopharynx, the oral cavity, the infratemporal fossa, and the cranial fossa. Given its connections, the pterygopalatine fossa can act as a conduit for the spread of inflammatory and neoplastic diseases in the head and neck. These images are of two different patients. This made the original diagnosis of a juvenile angiofibroma unlikely. Continue with the MR-images... The MRI shows a unilateral destructive tumor with marked diffusion
restriction (low signal intensity on ADC). So we have three red flags. The diffusion restriction is another argument against the
diagnosis of an juvenile angiofibroma, because a vascular lesion would not
cause diffusion restriction. There is invasion of the orbit and also of the anterior soft
tissue of the cheek (arrow). A biopsy was performed which revealed a rhabdomyosarcoma,
which was treated with chemotherapy.
Juvenile angiofibroma:
First look at the images. Why is this a typical juvenile angiofibroma? Findings: Continue with the DSA... The DSA shows the hypervascularity, which (in combination
with the characteristic  localization) is
strongly indicative of juvenile angiofibroma. Pre-operatively this patient was treated with embolization. Surgery has to be as radical as possible in order to prevent
recurrence. First look at the images. What are the findings? Findings: This is a typical juvenile angiofibroma. Continue with the MRI and DSA... And again the typical findings on MRI and DSA.
There is strong
enhancement and hypervascularity.
Cystic lesion in the neck:
Cystic lesions in the neck are very common. In young patients the chance of malignancy is low. However a cystic lesion in an adult patient, especially when
over 30 years, is a red flag.
Branchial cleft cyst:
These images are of a 59-year old man, who is a smoker and
presents with a swelling in the neck. The original MR-report stated that there was a cystic lesion
posterior to the submandibular gland and anterior to the sternocleidomastoid
muscle; no associated lymphadenopathy. 
Most likely diagnosis: branchial cleft
cyst. This seems a logical conclusion since the typical location of
a (second) branchial cleft cyst is between the submandibular gland and the
sternocleidomastoid muscle. However the age of the patient is a red flag. Continue reading... Five months later the swelling became painful. The MRI is repeated.
Look at the images.
What is your diagnosis? The findings are: These findings were thought to be the result of infection and a cystic metastasis was less likely, but could not be excluded, especially because of the age of the patient. The patient was treated with antibiotics and one month later the lesion was excised.
The specimen proved to be a branchial cleft cyst. Typical branchial cleft cysts are thin walled cystic lesions. However, cystic metastases can mimic a branchial cleft cyst. Especially lymph node metastases of a papillary thyroid
carcinoma and of an (HPV associated) oropharyngeal carcinoma. Human papilloma virus is the cause of cervical cancer and is
associated with vaginal and vulvar cancer It is also associated with cancer of the oropharynx (back of
the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils). As a rule of thumb: Any cystic neck lesion in an adult patient, especially
when over 30 years, should be considered suspicious and a malignant origin
should be excluded. Case courtesy R.H. Hermans, Leuven This is a branchial cleft cyst in a ten-year old in the typical location.
HPV associated oropharynx carcinoma:
These images are of a 69-year old man with a left neck swelling. It was reported as brachial cleft cyst.
The fluid fluid level (arrowhead) was thought to be debris as a result of prior infection or bleeding. In the follow up the swelling increased and ten months later the lesion was excised.
Pathology: Metastasis of a squamous cell carcinoma, positive for P16 marker.
This is a marker for human papilloma virus positivity. Continue... In search of the primary tumor, the ENT specialist noticed a slightly larger tonsil on the left. Notice that the area of low signal on the ADC is smaller that the area of high signal on the DWI (b1000).
This means that only the center of the tonsil is cancer. The carcinoma lies deep within the crypts of the tonsil and is frequently not visible during endoscopy. Biopsy revealed a HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma and the patient was treated with radiotherapy. Here two more cases of (seemingly) identical lesions: Notice the nodular enhancement in the wall (arrow). This is never seen in a branchial cleft cyst.

Spine fractures - TLICS Classification:

Thoraco-Lumbar Injury Classification and Severity score:
by Clark West, Stefan Roosendaal, Joost Bot and Frank Smithuis
Department of Radiology and Regional Spinal Cord Injury Center of the Delaware Valley, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia and the Radiology Department of the Free University Medical Center and the Academical Medical Center, Amsterdam:
Publicationdate 2015-05-01 The Thoraco-Lumbar Injury Classification and Severity score (TLICS) is a classification system for thoracolumbar spine injuries, designed to assist in clinical management. Unlike other classifications, the TLICS is an easy scoring system that depicts the features important in predicting spinal stability, future deformity, and progressive neurologic compromise. TLICS also facilitates appropriate treatment recommendations.
Introduction:
Most classification systems of spine injuries are based on injury mechanisms and describe how the injury occurred. This is all based on the premise that a fracture caused by forward flexion should be treated by undoing the flexion by positioning the patient in an extension brace, or by surgical intervention correcting the spinal column in extension. Some of the injuries thought to be due to extension mechanisms, however, turn out to be due to flexion and vice versa. These descriptions may thus be misleading. A problem with classifications such as the AO-classification is that they are usually complex, leading to high inter-reader variability. Using the popular Denis three-column classification may lead to another situation since it uses the terms stable and unstable. In many cases, however, there is no good correlation with the necessity for surgery. Furthermore, the word stability itself is ambiguous and may refer to direct osseous stability; it may refer to neurological stability and finally, to long-term (ligamentous) stability. Both of these commonly used systems fail to systematically take into account the neurological status of the patient and the indication for MRI to determine the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex. For these reasons the Spine Trauma Study Group introduced in 2005 the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Scale (1), with intention to be a reliable, ease-to-use tool to facilitate clinical decision making and as a practical alternative to cumbersome classification systems already in use. The TLICS consists of three independent parameters: A parameter can be scored 0-4 points and the total score is the sum of these parameters with a maximum of 10 points. The total score predicts the need for surgery as is shown in the TLICS algorithm. A total of more than 4 points indicates surgical treatment. A compression fracture gets 1 point. When it is complicated by a burst, it gets an additional 1 point, resulting in 2 points. The integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex plays an important role in the TLICS. Sometimes it will be possible to determine PLC injury on CT, but MRI may be necessary. When there are several fractures, each level has to be scored separately. The level with the highest TLICS score will determine the type of treatment. Morphology and PLC are scored separately. For example, in a translation/rotation injury, the PLC is always involved, making a total of 3+3=6 points. When there is a distraction on the posterior side, the PLC is always involved, making a total of 4+3=7 points. In case of a distraction on the anterior side, however, the PLC may or may not be involved, i.e. it will be either 4 or 4+3= 7 points.
Morphology:

Posterior Ligamentous Complex:
The PLC serves as a posterior "tension band" of the spinal column and plays an important role in the stability of the spine (3). A torn PLC has a tendency not to heal and can lead to progressive kyphosis and collapse. The PLC is composed of the supraspinous ligaments, interspinous ligaments, articular facet capsules, and ligamenta flava (figure). The supraspinous ligament is a strong, cordlike ligament which connects the tips of the spinous processes from C7 to the sacrum. The interspinous ligaments are weak, thin, membranous structures connecting the adjacent spinous processes. The contractile force of the ligamenta flava presses the vertebrae together and keeps them aligned. The facet joints act against rotational forces. CT features of PLC pathology are: When the PLC is definitely injured on CT, it can already be scored as 3. Since the integrity of the PLC depends mostly on ligamentous structures, MR is sometimes needed to adequately diagnose pathology of the PLC, especially when there is no dislocation or disruption on CT. MRI features of PLC pathology are: MRI has a tendency to overdiagnose PLC injury (4). In some cases it can be difficult to decide whether there is a burst fracture with a torn PLC or distraction with a torn PLC and a compression fracture (figure). You have to decide what you think is the main issue: the collapse of the vertebral body or the distraction. Since in both cases the TLICS score based on imaging will be high, there is usually an indication for surgical treatment. TLICS score In case of multiple fractures, you have to score each level separately. The level with the highest TLICS score usually will be decisive for the therapy of choice.
Neurological status:
The third category is the neurological status as determined by the neurologist or spine surgeon. The role of the radiologist is to report the following: One of the key points here is that an incomplete cord lesion will likely benefit more from surgery than a complete lesion; therefore a complete cord injury is scored as only 2 points, while an incomplete cord injury gets 3 points.
Modifiers:
Modifiers are other factors which can affect the decision of appropriate treatment: Sternum fracture Sternum fracture The image shows a vertebral fracture with a transverse fracture of the spinous process, but also a fracture of the sternum. Analogous to the 3-column classification of Denis, some investigators consider the sternum as the fourth column in upper thoracic spinal fractures and recognize it as an independent variable in the assessment and treatment of these patients (5). Rigid spine Patients with a rigid spine (such as in ankylosing spondylitis, DISH and rheumatoid arthritis) are more susceptible to spinal fractures, even after minimal trauma (6). Ossification of the spinal ligaments and calcification of the annulus fibrosus alter the biomechanics of the spine, creating long lever arms and limiting the ability to absorb even minor impacts. The bone is usually very osteoporotic. The images are of a patient with a typical bamboo spine as a result of ankylosing spondylitis. After a fall on his back no fracture was seen on the x-rays. However the CT shows a thin fracture line through the anterior side of the vertebral body and also through the spinous process. Continue with the MR-images. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Look at the images. What are the findings? Then scroll to the next images. The findings are: The TLICS-score is high, because there is distraction and injury to the PLC.
Simple compression:
A simple compression fracture is the most common form of injury and is seen in 90% of cases. It is either loss of height of the anterior part of the vertebral body or disruption of the vertebral endplate. The posterior cortex of the vertebral body has to be intact and this feature differentiates a simple compression fracture from the more severe burst fracture. The posterior cortex may bulge slightly posteriorly in a simple compression fracture. As long as there is no free fragment with posterior displacement, it is a wedge compression fracture and not a burst fracture. The images show a compression fracture. All we see is a cortical disruption in the upper anterior wall of the vertebral body and slight loss of height ventrally. The posterior vertebral cortex is intact. The sagittal reformatted image also shows the cortical disruption. Notice that on a 2.5mm axial slice you can miss these fractures. You have to look at the thin slices to detect such a subtle fracture. Enable Scroll

This density does not mean that it involves an older fracture that is already healing with sclerosis. This is merely a sign of trabecular impaction in an acute fracture. It is very common to see more fractures on imaging with CT and MRI than on the radiographs. In this case the CT shows 2 fractures and the MRI shows 3 fractures. Pitfalls in diagnosing a compression fracture are: The images show two cases of osteochondrosis. On the right with kyphosis.
Burst fracture:
This is the severe variant of a compression fracture with higher risk of neurologic deficits. The name is derived from the typical fracture following a fall from height and landing on the feet. A burst fracture gets 2 points for morphology in the TLICS. This means that a patient can be treated non-surgically. In the absence of a neurologic deficit, PLC integrity should be confirmed at MR imaging, especially if conservative management of a burst fracture is planned (3). In the Denis classification a burst fracture is classified as a two-column injury, calling it unstable and requiring surgical stabilization. Subsequent modifications of the Denis classification have recognized that with an intact posterior ligamentous complex (PLC), two-column unstable injuries can be successfully treated non-surgically (3).

Disable Scroll Retropulsion of posterosuperior vertebral body fragment Retropulsion of a fragment is the typical feature of a burst fracture and distinguishes it clearly from a simple compression fracture. Scroll through the images. Sagittal
fracture of vertebral body and
posterior element A sagittal fracture of the vertebral body and a sagittal posterior element fracture is seen in respectively 90% and 85% of cases of burst fracture cases. Here are four examples. In the Denis classification this would be a three column fracture -anterior/middle/posterior - indicating a very unstable fracture. In the TLICS classification however this is a burst fracture, i.e. 2 points for morphology. The treatment will depend on the PLC integrity and the neurological status. Widening of the interpedicular distance Widening of the interpedicular distance, often a result of the sagittal fracture, is seen in 80% of burst fractures. The lateral view shows the typical features of a burst fracture. On the AP-view notice the subtle widening of the interpedicular distance compared to the levels above and below. The axial CT and MRI in the same patient show the displaced fragment pressing on the thecal sac. On the sagittal CT and MRI there are no signs of posterior ligamentous injury. The anterior longitudinal ligament is disrupted. The right facet joint looks a bit widened on the CT and there is some fluid in the joint on the MRI. If there was a lot of fluid in the joint, we should call this indeterminate. In this case we are not sure. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images. How would you describe the morphology and the PLC? The findings are: You could argue that these fractures of the spinous processes indicate distraction, i.e. 4 points for morphology. However in this case the compression is the most prominent finding.
Translation - Rotation:
This type of fracture includes all fractures that are the result of displacement in the horizontal plane: side-to-side motion, either left-to-right or anterior-to-posterior or side-to-side rotary motion of one vertebral body with respect to another. Often unilateral or bilateral facet dislocation is seen in rotational fractures. It is a severe type of injury, which always involves the PLC. In the TLICS this means 3 points for the morphology and 3 points for the PLC, which makes a total of 6 points indicating the need for surgical stabilization. Enable Scroll

However notice the following: Even though there is not much displacement at this moment, we should probably call this translation injury. Continue with the axial images. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll On the axial images we see: These are typical findings in translation-rotation fractures. So we should call this a translation fracture with anterior displacement.
Distraction:
A distraction injury is separation or pulling apart of two adjacent vertebrae. It is a severe injury since there is a high chance of cord injury when its osseous and ligamentous supporting structures are pulled apart. A distraction injury on the posterior side can lead to a compression fracture on the anterior side. So be sure not to underestimate the injury by only looking at the compression fracture and overlooking the distraction injury. In some cases it is difficult to decide whether you are dealing with distraction combined with a compression fracture or with a compression fracture with PLC-injury. If the distraction is the main feature, then the morphology is distraction, i.e. 4 points. In these cases the PLC is always involved, resulting in a total of 7 points for the TLICS-score. If compression is the main feature, then the morphology is burst, i.e. 2 points combined with the PLC injury making a total of 5 points. In both cases the patient is a surgical candidate.

The vertebral body fractures show hardly any compression. Notice that there are 3 vertebrae involved. Only the level with the highest score counts. TLICS score based on imaging is 7 points: In this case there is severe compression of the vertebral body. However the most important findings are the horizontal fractures of the posterior elements. TLICS score based on imaging is 7 points. Enable Scroll

However the distraction is the most important finding, i.e. distraction and PLC injury, i.e. 4+3 points. So here is a typical case of distraction. The primary feature is pulling apart. There is not much else happening here. The disc space is markedly widened about four times the normal level. The facet joints are separated on both sides. There is a spinous process fracture, which is not a key element but a frequently associated injury. Continue with the MR. The MRI shows exactly the same things. Frequently when you have a good CT, you have most of the anatomic information. The MRI also shows disruption of the ligamentum flavum and a partial disruption of the interspinous ligament. TLICS score: This patient is at high risk of developing a spinal cord injury. Here a fracture that just looks like another compression fracture on the lateral view. At first glance the AP-view doesn't look very odd. That is until we zoom in and look at the distance between the spinous processes. Now when you look carefully at the lateral view, you will notice that the facets are separated. The MRI tells us the whole story. You can see the edema related to the fracture of the vertebral body and the massive edema in the paraspinous muscles. There is major disruption of the PLC of both the ligamenta flava and the interspinous ligament. TLICS: distraction injury + PLC disruption. This is an interesting case since non-surgical management was initially attempted in this patient. However when we classify according to the TLICS-score, we give 4 points for the morphology and 3 points for the PLC. Assuming the neurological exam was normal, this patient would still get 7 points. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, conservative management failed with near-dislocation. Finally a posterior spondylodesis was performed. Here's another example. You could call these compression fractures. There is loss of height with a dense band of impaction and there is an anterosuperior corner fracture on both levels. But look at the spinous processes. One of the spinous processes is in two pieces and the two pieces are widely separated. So this is a distraction fracture, also known as Chance fracture. Now when you describe such a fracture the first word in your report should be distraction, i.e. morphology: 4 points. This next case has a great teaching point. There is widening between the spinous processes. But there are also little pieces ofbone, that have avulsed at least 10mm away. At first we thought that little pieces of bone didn't matter, but they may be the most important sign of a major injury on a CT-scan. The fact that these little pieces of bone have been so severely displaced means there has to be a major injury. Now in this case there are lots of other things going on, but sometimes these little pieces of bone are all you get. If you look back, see how nicely it correlates with the PLC-injury on the MRI. The teaching point is: pay careful attention to little pieces of bone. Patients with a rigid spine are more at risk for translation or distraction. Here is a patient with distraction on the anterior side. Notice the rigid spine and how easily this major injury can be overlooked. This patient had a motorcycle accident. The MRI demonstrates rupture of the flava ligaments, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments as well as fracture of the posterior elements and compression of the vertebral body. A posterior spondylodesis was performed. Here another distraction injury. At surgery the rupture of the supraspinous ligament was confirmed (red and black arrows)

MRI examination of the ankle:
Frank Smithuis and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre in Amsterdam and Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp in the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2019-03-01 In this article a systematic approach is presented on how to describe a standard MRI of the ankle. The following subjects will be discussed: MRI protocol Systematic approach
Systematic approach:
We use a checklist when evaluating an MRI of the Ankle: When you have evaluated all these structures, combine your findings and try to make a specific diagnosis.
Bones:

Bone marrow edema:
Start your exam with fatsat images of the bones to screen for edema. Bone marrow edema is only an indication that there is something abnormal in the bone or connected structures. This patient has bone marrow edema on the posterior side of the distal tibia. On the axial image, the edema is localised around the insertion site of the posterior syndesmosis. This is edema due to a ligamentous avulsion injury. Here two patients with bone marrow edema. The patient on the left has bone marrow edema in the medial malleolus. The patient on the right has edema in the medial talus. Both patients have had an eversion injury, with stretching of the deltoid ligament. The bone marrow edema in these patients is due to avulsion injury on the insertion sites of the deltoid ligament. This patient has bone marrow edema in both the medial malleolus and the medial talus. The lateral ligaments also show edema and thickening. The bone marrow edema is likely due to impaction of talus and medial malleolus secondary to inversion injury.
Stress fractures:
Stress fractures of the calcaneus are a frequently unrecognized source of heel pain. This patient has edema in the calcaneus as a result of a stress fracture. This injury usually results from overuse, especially in runners. When the fracture is not seen on the T2W fatsat-images, look at the non-fatsat T2W or the T1W- images for a hypointense fracture line. Sometimes the fracture line is not seen on MR. In those cases you may consider a CT-scan which can be more sensitive. This patient has multiple stress fractures of the calcaneus. In this patient there is very subtle edema in the distal fibula. No fracture line is visible. There is subtle thickening of the cortex and some infiltration of the subperiosteum. When there is edema like in this case and no visible fracture line, you may consider CT. Do not mention the edema without having ruled out a fracture line on MR or CT. Stress fractures are easy to miss on MR alone and this could lead to a wrong diagnosis like for instance osteomyelitis. In this case there is a lot of edema in the navicular bone. The axial image nicely depicts the stress fracture.
OCD:
OCD is an abbreviation which can stand for either Osteochondritis Dissecans or Osteochondral Defect. Osteochondritis dissecans is used when the patient is young and the cause is not exactly known, yet most probably due to repetitive microtrauma. Osteochondral defect is mainly used when a patient is older or when a particular trauma is thought to be the cause of the defect. Both describe a joint defect which involves the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. When a small defect in the chondral plate is present, the intraarticular fluid will erode the subchondral bone, which will result in bone marrow edema. This process can evolve into cyst formation. Finally, when fluid flows underneath the defect, the OCD can become unstable and may result in a corpus liberum. Here three patients with various stages of OCD.
Os Trigonum:
In the foot and ankle many accessory ossicles can be seen. The most common ossicle is the os trigonum, which is a prominent unfused apophysis of the lateral tubercle of the talus. The os trigonum is present in the normal population in about 5-15%. Compression of the os trigonum and surrounding soft tissues between the tibia and the calcaneus during plantar flexion can be a cause of posterior impingement. This is especially seen in ballet dancers. The term Stieda process is used, when the lateral tubercle is very prominent. This can also lead to posterior impingement. Here another patient with an os trigonum. On the fatsat images edema is present in the os trigonum and surrounding soft tissue. This is an example of posterior impingement due to a symptomatic os trigonum. Here an example of an os trigonum with rather subtle edema. This case is shown to demonstrate the great variety of ossicles and tubercles on the posterior side of the talus. This patient has an unfused prominent lateral tubercle with a fibrous connection to the talus, therefore it is a partly fused os trigonum. On the axial image more unfused prominent tubercles on both the medial and lateral side of the lateral tubercle are seen.
Joints:

Effusion:
Once you have studied the bones, scan the joints for effusion. The left image shows a normal fluid accumulation in the tibiotalar joint, talocalcaneal joint en retrocalcaneal bursa. The right image shows massive joint effusion as a reaction to degenerative osteochondral defects in the tibiotalar joint. The effusion can run alongside the flexor hallucis longus tendon (FHL), since this tendon sheath is continuous with the joint. Two examples of diffuse joint effusion in the tibiotalar joint. There is also some joint effusion in the talocalcaneal joint.
Capsular thickening:
The ankle joint is lined by the joint capsule. When the capsule is thickened, it may cause impingement or synovitis, which can be seen in the image in the middle. The capsule thickening can be posttraumatic or postoperative. On the right a patient who developed postoperative fibrosis after resection of a Haglund exostosis. There is fibrosis along the posterior calcaneus and the posterior joint capsule. In this patient there is only a small effusion in the ankle joint. On the non fatsat images there is subtle thickening of the capsule, with reactive changes in the surrounding soft tissue. This patient had anterior ankle pain due to impingement by the thickened capsule. Here another example of thickening of the capsule. On the fatsat images, you may think that there is only some edema in the subcutaneous fatty tissue. On the non fatsat images however, there is obvious thickened fibrotic tissue on the anterior side. Capsular thickenig and soft tissue abnormalities are usually better seen on non-fatsat images. In this case there is fibrous thickening of the capsule (arrow). This patient has secundary degenerative changes in the joint with subchondral edema and cyst formation. It is a result of repetitive impaction of the fibrotic tissue on the bone during dorsal flexion.

Anatomy in axial plane:
Scroll through the image stack for the ligamentous anatomy in the axial plane. You can click on the image to enlarge. The syndesmoses are best seen on axial images: The syndesmoses are usually involved in exorotation injuries like:
Anterior syndesmosis:
In A - a normal anterior syndesmosis is seen as a thin low intensity band. In B - the anterior syndesmosis is thickened with edema, indicating partial tearing or grade 2 injury. In C - the anterior syndesmosis is thickened and there probably is a focal discontinuity (arrow) and that is the reason why this was called a grade 3 injury (full thickness tear). Isolated injury of the anterior syndesmosis can be seen in low grade exorotation injuries. In this patient there is a full thickness tear of the anterior syndesmosis (yellow arrow). There is also a fracture of the malleolus tertius (blue arrow). More proximal, edema is seen around the membrana interossei. This patient had a Weber C fracture, which is a grade 4 pronation exorotation injury in the Lauge-Hansen classification.
Posterior syndesmosis:
Acute injury presents as edema and thickening, while an old injury presents with thickening and low signal intensity due to scar formation. In A there is edema and thickening around the anterior and posterior syndesmosis (arrow), indicative of acute grade 2 injuries. In B there is edema and thickening of the posterior syndesmosis, which is an acute grade 2 injury. The anterior syndesmosis is also thickened but shows low signal. This is scar formation as a result of prior injury. In C there is scar tissue as a result of previous injury, which again can be a cause of posterior impingement.
ATFL:
There are three ligaments on the lateral side: The ATFL runs from the lateral malleolus anteriorly to the lateral border of the talus. It has a transverse orientation and is best seen on axial images. This is the most commonly injured ligament of the ankle and it is also the first to be injured on the lateral side. This means that when the CFL or the PTFL are injured, it is very likely that the ATFL is injured aswell. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll through the coronal images. You can enlarge the image by clicking on it. Here we see three patients with ATFL injury. The patient on the left has subtle edema around the ATFL-ligament, while the ligament itself looks normal. This probably represents a mild strain (grade 1). Usually this is best appreciated on fatsat images. The patient in the middle has thickening and architecture distortion representing a partial tear (grade 2). The patient on the right has a full thickness tear (grade 3). Bright rim sign This sign presents as a fine linear band of high signal intensity which is the result of a small avulsion of cortical bone in a grade 3 full thickness tear. Here an example of a grade 3 ATFL tear with a bright rim sign (arrow). It is thought that it is caused by a chemical shift artifact when subcortical fatty marrow is exposed to joint fluid.
CFL:
The Calcaneofibular ligament runs from the distal fibula to the lateral side of the calcaneus and is best appreciated on coronal images. The CFL passes two joints, the talocrural joint and the talocalcaneal joint. Isolated injury of the CFL is uncommon. Most of the time the ATFL is injured as well.
PTFL:
The Posterotalofibular ligament courses posterior to the lateral tubercle on the posterior aspect of the talus. Isolated injury is very rare. When it is injured, there has to be injury to the other lateral ligaments. Here a normal PTFL and a grade 2 tear. Notice that there is also a grade 2 tear of the ATFL. Enable Scroll

Deltoid ligament:
The deltoid or medial ligament is more difficult to evaluate, since seven components have been described. Some components are always present, while others are variable and not always seen on a standard MR. The deltoid ligament is best evaluated in the coronal plane. The deep layer connects the inferior border of the medial malleolus to the medial side of the talus. The fibers are interposed with fatty tissue, giving it a striped pattern on MR. The superficial layer of the deltoid ligament is connected to the navicular bone anteriorly and the calcaneus posteriorly. At the insertion on the medial malleolus, it blends with the periosteum of the medial malleolus and the flexor retinaculum. Caudally, it is connected to the Spring ligament, which is the superomedial part of the calcaneonavicular ligament. This ligament serves as a hammock for the talus. The Spring ligament is oriented obliquely and has a close relation with the deltoid ligament and the posterior tibial tendon. Surgical repair of the spring ligament is increasingly being recognized as an important management component of the adult-acquired flatfoot. These images show injury to the deep deltoid ligament. It is difficult to differentiate between grade 1 and 2 injuries, because the edema will blur the normal striped pattern. The image on the right shows fiber discontinuity making it a full thickness or grade 3 tear. First look at the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: On these images we can recognize the close relationship between the deltoid ligament and the periosteum of the medial malleolus and the flexor retinaculum. On the image in the middle there is a deltoid ligament injury with separation of the periosteum or "periosteal stripping". In addition, the flexor retinaculum is thickened. On the image on the right there is thickening of the deltoid ligament with a low signal intensity as a result of chronic injury. Note that the periosteum and flexor retinaculum are also thickened. Thickening of the periosteum is a common finding and indicates injury of the deltoid ligament in the past.
Plantar fascia:
The plantar fascia is a thick aponeurosis which supports the arch on the plantar side of the foot. It runs from the tuberosity of the calcaneus to the heads of the metatarsal bones. Plantar fasciitis, the most common cause of heel pain in the athlete, is a low-grade inflammation involving the plantar aponeurosis and the perifascial structures. MR can show edema around the insertion of the plantar fascia on the calcaneus and spurring. When the patient is treated, the edema will vanish, but the spurring may still be present. Spurring as seen on a X-ray therefore can be seen in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Tendons:

Anatomy in the axial plane:
The tendons can be divided into four compartments: Tendinopathy is a collective term to describe different tendon disorders like tendinosis, tendinitis and mucoid degeneration. The pathogenesis of these disorders is different, but the clinical presentation and imaging features are not always distinctive. Therefore it is best just to describe a tendon abnormality as tendinopathy without trying to further specifying the abnormality. MR findings in tendinopathy are: Most tendons in the ankle joint have a tenosynovial layer. A small amount of fluid around the tendon therefore can be normal. The amount of fluid should not exceed the volume of the tendon itself. The achilles tendon does not have a tenosynovial layer but a paratenon. Fluid around the Achilles tendon is always abnormal.
Posterior tibial tendon:
The posterior tibial tendon is the most commonly injured tendon. Tendinopathy is seen as abnormal swelling of the tendon, but you have to realize, that the normal posterior tibial tendon can measure twice the size of the flexor digitorum tendon. Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction is more common in women and in people older than 40 years of age. It results in pain and swelling on the medial aspect of the ankle and an acquired flatfoot deformity. Posterior tibial tendon injury in young patients is mainly due to trauma or overuse. When the posterior tibial tendon is injured, be sure to check the spring ligmanent, since they together maintain the arch of the foot on the medial side. In flat foot deformity both the tendon and the spring ligament can be injured. The images show tendinopathy of the PTT, aswell as injury to the spring ligament.
Achilles tendon:
The Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the human body. The two most common injuries are tendinopathy and rupture. Achilles tendinopathy is most likely due to a series of microtears that weaken the tendon and cause swelling of the tendon (image on the right). On sagital images the achilles tendon should be a straight line without any fluid around it and no focal thickening. A transverse diameter of 8 mm is the cut off. Three fat sat axial images of the achilles tendon. Normal achilles tendon. Its border is concave, it is within 7mm, no paratenon fluid is seen.
* Middle Normal achilles tendon. Note that the other tendons all contain fluid, but the achilles paratenon shows no fluid at all.
* Right Fluid alongside the paratenon, i.e. paratenonitis and achilles tendinopathy. Normally, a small amount of fluid is seen in the retrocalcanear bursa. Too much fluid is indicative of bursitis. Thickening of the Achilles is seen with paratenonitis. The Haglund syndrome consists of the triad of: This image shows fibrotic tissue anterior to the Achilles tendon (yellow arrow) after resection of a Haglund exostosis. This was the cause of continuing impingement. This image shows an extreme case of insertion tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon. Another example of Achilles tendinopathy. Rupture of the Achilles tendon usually occurs in the part of the tendon situated within 6 centimeters of the insertion to the calcaneus. This part is prone to rupture because the blood flow in this area is poor, which also can impair its ability to heal. The image shows an old rupture.
Peroneal tendons:
The peroneus brevis tendon is injury-prone, because it is positioned inbetween the fibula and peroneus longus tendon. As the foot undergoes dorsiflexion, the peroneus brevis tendon is repeatedly compressed between the peroneus longus tendon and the lateral malleolus, predisposing to tear. Once a small tear is initiated, it will results in a cashew nut deformity. The peroneus longus tendon migrates forward into the peroneus brevis tendon tear, thereby preventing healing (figure). In the middle and right we see two examples of cashew nut deformity, indicative of partial split rupture. This can be challenging, because the actual tear cannot be seen, only the architectural deformation. Split tears are associated with inversion injuries, most likely due to greater force on these tendons after ligamentous injury. Split tears of the peroneus longus are less common. They are associated with a prominent calcaneal tubercle. Anterior The extensor tendons are rarely injured. Tom Hates Dick is a useful mnemonic.
Accessory muscles:
Accessory muscles are frequently seen around the ankle joint. Since they have a normal signal intensity, they are easily missed. However when you compare the findings with the normal patient on the left, you will detect the big accessory soleus muscle. Some examples of accessory muscles. They are usually asymptomatic, but can be a cause of impingement in specific patient groups (dancers, athletes). Accessory FHL or FDL are associated with tarsal tunnel syndrome. The patient on the right has a hypertrophic plantaris muscle. This can be a cause of Achilles tendinopathy.
MRI protocol:
Standard axial, coronal and sagittal planes are used in the ankle both on 1.5T and in 3T. In addition to the standard planes, a oblique scan is sometimes included oriented perpendicular to the peroneus and tibialis posterior tendons. Small tears or subtle tendinopathy are better visualized on these views. The orientation of the tendons along the medial and lateral malleolus can cause the 'magic angle artifact' to occur. The tendons will show relatively hyperintense signal at 55* to B0), simulating pathology like tendinopathy or partial tears. This artifact is visible on short TE images (f.e. PD). On long TE images (like T2) this artifact does also occur but less pronounced. by Kiley D. Perrich et al. AJR 2009; 193:687-695
Neck Masses in Children:
Annemieke Littooij, Cécile Ravesloot and Erik Beek
Radiology department of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2016-11-01 A mass in the neck is a common finding in children. In this article we present a pictorial essay of neck masses in children and provide a diagnostic approach based on the location of the lesion and whether it is cystic or solid. Ultrasound is the imaging method of choice and in many cases a definite diagnosis is possible, especially if the lesion is cystic. MRI is of value in large lesions, to determine whether the lesion infiltrates into deep spaces. CT is sometimes applied in acutely ill patients with infections to assess whether an abscess is present. In suspected malignant lymphoma ultrasound can demonstrate which node is most accessible to image guided biopsy or excision, while PET/CT is used for staging.
Introduction:

Diagnostic approach:
In a neck lesion in a child, ultrasound can usually determine whether a lesion is cystic or solid. Often more than one lymph node is enlarged. Try to differentiate between reactive nodes, lymphadenitis due to TB or cat-scratch disease and malignant lymphoma.
* Solid - not a lymph nodeIf a solid lesion is not a lymph node look for a possible site of origin, like the salivary gland, the thyroid gland or the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Subcutaneous solid lesions sometimes have a typical appearance, like pilomatrixomas, lipomas or hemangiomas. In many cases however a solid lesion will be non-specific and a diagnosis can only be made through biopsy or excision. Click on image to enlarge
Location of cystic lesions:
Once you have decided that the lesion is cystic its location will often point to its nature (figure). Midline lesions Midline lesions are either thyroglossal duct cysts, dermoid cysts or ranulas. Older children can be asked to protrude their tongue. A thyroglossal duct cyst will move upward with the hyoid bone. Ranulas have a typical location in the floor of the mouth. Off-midline lesions Off-midline lesions can be branchial cleft cysts or lymphangiomas. Branchial cleft cysts often contain debris. Anteriorly located lymphangiomas are often multicystic. In the posterior neck they are often single.
Cystic lesions:
Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. In neck lesions we first try to figure out whether a lesion is cystic or solid. In clear cystic lesions this is straightforward. It can however be a problem if the cyst has been inflamed or when a cyst has bled, since children often present with a preexistent lesion that has bled. Try to elicit swirling of the contents by compressive movements of the probe or by changing the position of the child and look for acoustic enhancement. The video shows a swelling, that appeared overnight in a 13-year-old girl. A hypo-echoic lesion is seen superficial to the carotid artery and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. No movement of the lesions content was seen when pinged with the probe. When the girl was asked to sit upright the contents swirled.
Thyroglossal duct cyst:
Thyroglossal duct cysts are common lesions in children. The thyroglossal duct runs from the base of tongue at the foramen caecum to the thyroid gland. The embryonic thyroid gland travels through the duct to reach its final normal position. Normally, the thyroglossal duct then involutes, but when the duct persists, a thyroglossal duct cyst can develop anywhere along this tract (figure). Thyroglossal duct cysts move upward if the tongue is protruded or during swallowing (see next movie). Ultrasound is usually sufficient to make the diagnosis. Always look for the presence of a normal thyroid gland and make an image of it. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. This videoclip demonstrates the upward movement of the thyroglossal duct cyst together with the hyoid bone during swallowing. Thyroglossal duct cyst Thyroglossal duct cysts can be anechoic or hypo-echoic with internal echoes, due to infection, hemorrhage, or proteinaceous content. The majority of thyroglossal duct cysts is located within 2 cm of the midline. Here a tranverse image of a hypoechoic thyroglossal duct cyst with some internal echoes located in the midline. Thyroglossal duct cyst Here a tranverse image of an anechoic thyroglossal duct cyst just left of the midline. Typical hyper-echoic dermoid cyst in the suprasternal notch.
Dermoid cyst:
Dermoid cysts are inclusion cysts, that contain epithelium and skin adnexa like hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands. 7% of dermoid cysts occur in the head and neck region, especially around the orbit and in the midline of the neck, with a predilection for the suprasternal notch. Here a typical homogeneous hyper-echoic oval lesion, representing a dermoid cyst, which was located in its favorite location, the suprasternal notch. Dermoid cyst In the neck dermoid cysts are generally homogeneously hyperechoic, although they can be inhomogeneous. The differentiation from a thyroglossal duct cyst can be difficult if the dermoid cyst is located near the hyoid bone. The content of thyroglossal duct cysts is usually hypo-echoic and may contain internal echoes, while dermoid cysts generally have a more homogeneous hyper-echoic content. Here an unusual inhomogeneous appearance of a dermoid cyst in front of the thyroid gland (figure). Orbital dermoid cyst The most common location of a dermoid cyst in the head-neck region is around the orbit, typically at the upper outer corner. On ultrasound they are anechoic and one should look for the presence of a bony lining. If the integrity of the bony lining is uncertain, a CT or MRI is necessary to determine possible intracranial extension. Here a typical orbital dermoid cyst. It was firm on palpation and located at the lateral border of the orbit. On ultrasound it is anechoic with remodelling of the underlying bone.
Branchial cleft cyst:
Most branchial cysts are remnants of the second brancial cleft. Cysts at the level of the thyroid gland can be remnants of the third or fourth branchial cleft. Incomplete obliteration results in either a cyst (75%), a sinus or a fistula (25%). Cysts present as painless masses, sometimes appearing suddenly after internal hemorrhage. They are located along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lateral to the common carotid artery, and if more cranially between the internal and external carotid artery. Sometimes a beak sign may be seen as a curved rim of the lesion pointing medially between the internal and external carotid. Typical ultrasound appearance of a branchial cleft cyst with echogenic debris. On ultrasound they often contains internal echoes caused by debris, which consists of cholesterol crystals. The cyst is usually compressible, which results in movement of the content. This may not be the case in a cyst with a fresh internal hemorrhage. They can inflame and present with an empyema. Here another branchial cyst with a typical location superficial to the carotid artery bifurcation. Branchial sinuses Branchial sinuses are blind ending tracts, presenting anterior of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Branchial second arch fistulas end in the tonsillar fossa, as can be demonstrated with a contrast fistulogram or MRI. With ultrasound a tract can often be seen to travel upwards, but it is usually not possible to depict the proximal ending. Here a two-year-old boy with a dirty spot in the right lower neck. A small tract could be seen to extend inwards. At operation a second branchial fistula was excised. Here a ten-year-old girl with a pit in the right neck, anterior of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. On US a long cystic lesion can be seen which can be traced up to the right submandibular region. At operation, the fistula extended towards the right tonsillar fossa and was excised.
Lymphangioma:
Lymphangiomas are cystic lesions, caused by maldevelopment of the lymph channels. The majority occur in young children, with 90% in the head and neck region. In the posterior neck a lymphangioma usually has one or more larger cysts. In the anterior neck a lymphangioma can consist of innumerable small cysts, and may infiltrate deeply into the neck or mediastinum. This is also called a hygroma colli. The sonographic appearance depends on the size and number of cysts. Larger cysts are mostly anechoic or may contain some debris. A microcystic lymphangioma can be hyper-echoic due to the high number of closely related reflecting walls. Here an ultrasound of a typical lymphangioma. MRI was performed because the extension of the lesion was not clear. Here the T2-weighted image of the same patient. On T1-weighted images the content has a variable signal intensity, depending on its protein or blood content. It generally has a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Contrast enhanced T1 can show enhancement of the wall. Here an ultrasound image of a six-year-old girl with a sudden swelling in the left neck. There were several small anechoic cysts and one large cyst containing internal echoes, which were probably the result of a bleeding in a preexistent lymphangioma. A 3-year-old boy presented suddenly with a supraclavicular mass. Ultrasound showed a lesion with echogenic debris. A hemorrhage in a preexisting lymphangioma was suspected. Continue with the MRI. The T1-weighted image shows a slightly hyperintense lesion with a fluid-fluid level (arrow). After gadolineum administration there is enhancement of the cyst wall. The lesion subsided with conservative therapy. Ranula
Ranula:
A ranula is a fluid filled cyst originating from the sublingual salivary gland. It can extend into the floor of the mouth and be visible on inspection of the oral cavity. It can also extend through or over the mylohyoid muscle and is then called a "plunging ranula" and present as a submental or submandibular mass. Here an image of a sixteen-year-old boy with a firm swelling under the tongue on the left side. Ultrasound showed an anechoic mass continuous with the sublingual salivary gland. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Jugular ectasia:
In some children a swelling can appear in the lower neck during straining. This is often caused by dilatation of the internal jugular vein as can easily be demonstrated by ultrasound that will show the variations in caliber of the vein. An example is shown on the video of a seven-year-old boy, initially suspected of a laryngocele.
Solid lesions - Lymph nodes:
This image shows a commonly used classification for the location of lymph nodes. Submental and submandibular nodes
* Level 2 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, above the level of the hyoid bone
* Level 3 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, between the hyoid bone and cricoid cartilage
* Level 4 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, below the cricoid cartilage
* Level 5 Posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the clavicles
* Level 6 Anterior to the thyroid gland Normal lymph nodes are always visible with ultrasound in children. A normal lymph node: The normal jugulodigastric node which is located below the mandibular angle can have a short axis of 15 mm. Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck are very common in children. In most cases these are reactive nodes as a reaction to a nearby infection. Less commonly it is due to a primary infection of the lymph nodes itself, which is called lymphadenitis. Usually the terms reactive lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis are used synonymously. Although ultrasound cannot always reliably distinguish lymphadenitis from a malignant lymphoma, the following table can be helpful to decide whether an excision biopsy should be done or that a "wait and scan" policy can be adopted. Supraclavicular lymph nodes should always be considered to be malignant until proven otherwise.
Reactive lymph nodes:
Reactive lymph nodes are a reaction to nearby inflammation. They are slightly enlarged and more hypoechoic than normal with a broader echogenic center. Here a six-year-old boy with weight loss, fatigue and lymphadenopathy. On ultrasound a string of enlarged lymph nodes with preservation of a echogenic hilum was seen. Excision biopsy showed reactive lymph nodes. Here a two-year-old girl with a palpable swelling in the left neck since a few weeks. On ultrasound the lymph nodes are enlarged with preservation of the echogenic hilus and normal perfusion. It was decided to wait and see and the nodes slowly shrunk.
Bacterial or viral lymphadenitis:
A bacterial or viral lymphadenitis is an infection of the node itself. Bacterial lymphadenitis is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or B-hemolytic Streptococcus. The nodes, which are frequently located in the submandibular region, are painful and the skin is warm and red. Bacterial lymphadenitis has an acute onset and is usually unilateral. The ultrasound image is of a one-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck for three weeks. A partly liquefied lymphnode is seen with infiltration of the surrounding subcutaneous fat. The swelling disappeared on antibiotic treatment. Abscess formation is clinically difficult to detect, and ultrasound is also not reliable. Signs of liquefaction are areas with a detectable wall and more hypoechoic center or areas with mobile, moving echoreflections. According to the literature there are 30% false-positive ánd false-negative results. Here a one-year-old boy with a swelling in the right neck for one week. Ultrasound shows an enlarged lymph node with areas of liquefaction. It was incised and drained, after which the infection subsided.
Cat-scratch disease:
Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae. The infection is the result of a scratch or bite of a cat. It is the most common cause of chronic axillary lymphadenopathy. The symptoms are often mild and lymph node swelling can be prolonged. The clinical diagnosis can be difficult and PCR results are insensitive. On ultrasound the affected nodes are round, heterogeneously hypoechoic, hypervascular, and with some surrounding inflammation. The nodes are a bit tender but not painful. They can be difficult to distinguish from malignant nodes. Here an ultrasund image of a sixteen-year-old girl, who was treated for recurrence of acute lymphatic leukaemia. Six months after the last treatment, she developed a swelling in the left shoulder region. A hypoechoic node without any internal structure was seen. It was excised. The final diagnosis was, surprisingly, Bartonella henselae. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Cat-scratch disease 2 Here a video of a fifteen-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck. There are multiple lymph nodes with surrounding infiltrated tissue. Continue with next video. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. After a week suppuration was seen. Aspirated pus was positive for Bartonella henselae. The boy was successfully treated with antibiotics. Two-year-old boy with a progressive swelling in the neck. No effect of antibiotics. An atypical Mycobacterium infection (avium) was confirmed. The anechoic parts (arrow) in the node are often seen in atypical Mycobacteria infection.
Mycobacteria:
Infection with atypical Mycobacteria generally occurs in patients between one and five years of age. There are few clinical symptoms, most often only a palpable mass. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually unilateral and in the pre-auricular or submandibular area. There is often a pronounced skin discoloration. Tuberculosis (TB) and atypical Mycobacteria frequently present with a single enlarged node and some smaller satellite lesions. There is central necrosis, thickening of the overlying skin, surrounding inflammation and after a while a confluent mass. Fistulas may be present. Calcifications are seen more commonly in TB infections than in atypical Mycobacterial infections, especially after treatment. Continue with next image... Three months later the swelling is still present. The deeper lymphnode has liquefied. After another four months a lymph node had undergone liquefaction and discharged in the surrounding tissue. Here an ultrasound image of a 6-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck. Fine calcifications are seen in the lymph node. The Mantoux and Qferon test were positive, but cultures for tuberculosis were negative. The patient was treated with tuberculostatics with good result.
Malignant lymphoma:
Malignant lymphoma presents with painless lymphadenopathy. In Hodgkin lymphoma the cervical nodes are most commonly involved, while in non-Hodgkin lymphoma the nodes of the Waldeyer ring are often involved. On ultrasound the affected nodes are round, homogeneously hypoechoic and the normal echogenic hilum is absent. The diagnosis is made by ultrasound-guided biopsy or excision. PET/CT will demonstrate the extension of the disease. The images are of a fourteen-year-old boy with a painless swelling in the left neck. The ultrasound shows several enlarged hypoechoic lymhnodes, that lack an hyper-echoic hilum. Here another fourteen-year-old boy with a painless swelling in the left neck. Ultrasound showed several enlarged lymhnodes. Continue with the MR and PET/CT... A coronal STIR image shows the pathologic lymph node masses similar to the PET-CT. The diagnosis was Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Solid lesions - not lymph nodes:
The most common cause of a solid lesion in the neck is an enlarged lymph node as we just discussed. Other solid lesions in the neck are far less common. They are listed in the table. In many cases the imaging findings in a solid lesion will be non-specific and a diagnosis can only be made through biopsy or excision.
Thyroid lesions:
Congenital anomalies The most common anomalie is a partial or complete agenesis of the gland. In partial agenesis the gland is ectopic and located anywhere between the base of the tongue and the thyroid cartilage. Mostly near or in the tongue, a lingual thyroid. Here an image of a newborn with an abnormal thyroid test. No thyroid gland is visible in the neck, neither in its usual position nor higher up in the neck. Thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules are common. They can be single or multiple. Some are purely cystic but most are solid. On ultrasound they are isoechoic with the normal gland. In a goiter a multitude of solid nodules are seen. If there is concern about a possible malignancy fine needle aspiration can be done. Preferably a technician of the cytology department is present to make a quick assessment of the retrieved cells to ascertain that thyroid cells are aspirated, and not only blood. This is an ultrasound image of a six-year-old girl with a small cyst with a septum in the right thyroid lobe. It remained unchanged over a year. Hashimoto's thyroiditis: An enlarged thyroid gland with a diffuse inhomogeneous structure and hyperemia is seen in a ten-year-old girl Thyroiditis The most common forms of thyroiditis are Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves disease. Both Hashimoto's thyreoiditis and Graves disease can present as an enlarged and hyperemic thyroid. Hashimoto's thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is an auto-immune disease. It presents with hypothyroidism. Although primarily a disease of the middle-aged it can present in children. On ultrasound the gland is diffusely enlarged and inhomogeneous. On color doppler the blood flow is often normal but can be increased like in Graves' disease. In a later stage the gland shrinks. Graves disease In Graves disease the thyroid gland is also enlarged and shows an increased perfusion. On color Doppler it has been described as an inferno in red and blue. Here an image of a 16-year-old girl with hyperthreoidism. A diffusely enlarged thyroid gland is seen with hyperemia. The final diagnosis was Graves disease. She was treated with I-131. Ultrasound image of the thymus in a two-months-old boy.
Thymus:
The thymus is located in the upper mediastinum and can be visualized with a suprasternal scan plane. With increasing age its echogenicity increases and becomes more granular. Ultrasound is ideal to demonstrate the thymus as a cause of a widened upper mediastinum in infants. Sometimes the thymus causes a swelling in the suprasternal notch on straining. Such a herniating thymus can be demostrated with ultrasound. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. The thymus is located in the upper mediastinum and can be visualized with a suprasternal scan plane. Ultrasound image of the thymus in an eight-year-old boy. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Here a video of a six-month-old boy with a mass which was sometimes visible in the suprasternal notch. While crying the thymus was seen to herniate in front of the trachea. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Ectopic thymus:
Ectopic thymic tissue may occur anywhere along the path of descent through the thymopharyngeal duct. When it presents as a neck mass, it can be mistaken for a tumor. The ectopic part of the thymus has the same echo characteristics as the normal thymus. The video shows an ectopic thymic remnant, which was an incidental finding in the neck, detected on a MRI of the brain in a 2-year-old boy. The ectopic thymus has the ultrasound characteristics as the normal gland. Here images of a six-month old boy with a vocal cord paralysis. The MRI examination shows a mass between the parotid and submandibular gland (yellow arrow). The signal characteristics are equal to the thymus (green arrow). Ultrasound confirmed an ectopic thymic remnant (yellow arrow), with identical sonographic characteristics as the orthotopic thymus (green arrow). Left: orthotopic thymus; right: ectopic thymus LEFT: normal sternocleidomastoid muscle. RIGHT: Hyperechoic mass in sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Fibromatosis colli:
Fibromatosis collis is a swelling of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in a newborn. It is probably caused by pressure necrosis of the muscle during delivery. Contrary to common belief it is not caused by hemorrhage. 50% of affected babies are born in breech. The swelling becomes apparent one to three weeks after birth. Sometimes a torticollis is noted. The swelling will usually regress spontaneously within a few months. On ultrasound an enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is seen. It can affect the whole muscle or part of it. The sternal head is always affected, and often the cleidal head as well. It can be hypo-, iso- or hyperechoic. Longitudinal images of the swelling will demonstrate its muscular origin. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Here a video of a two-month-old boy with a torticollis. A mass is seen within the enlarged sternocleidomastoid muscle. The diagnosis is fibromatosis collis Hemangioma
Vascular anomalies:
Vascular anomalies are classified into proliferative vascular tumors and vascular malformations. This classification is important as the treatment is different. Some vascular tumors will regress spontaneously or after administration of beta-blockers. Vascular malformations however need excision, sclerosing, or embolisation, if treatment is requested. The classifications of these lesions is constantly changing and beyond the scope of this article. A recent article on vascular anomalies provides a new classification (2). Hemangioma Hemangiomas are benign vascular neoplasms. They are the most common tumors of infancy. 60% of hemangiomas are seen in the head-neck regio. They usually appear in the first weeks after birth, show rapid growth, followed by spontaneous involution. Here we see images of a highly vascular lesion in the left submandibular region, which was present at birth. Three months later it had decreased in size. Infantile hemangioma A soft swelling was present on the side of the head in a six-week-old boy. It was small at birth and showed rapid growth. This is typical for an infantile hemangioma. Venous malformation Venous malformation A six-month-old boy presented with a swelling in the left neck at birth. Several ultrasound examinations could not differentiate between a hemangioma or a venous malformation. At six months of age, the ultrasound showed a lesion, which was mostly composed of vessels which increased in size on straining. On color Doppler the lesion showed increased flow while crying. The final diagnosis on imaging and on clinical examination was a venous malformation. Firm tumor in the right temporal area of a 2-year-old boy. Ultrasound shows an echogenic lesion with a well demarcated wall and slight posterior shadowing, characteristic for a pilomatrixoma.
Pilomatrixoma:
A pilomatrixoma or epithelial inclusion cyst of Malherbe is a benign skin lesion associated with hairfollicles. It presents as a firm, mobile, painless swelling. Sometimes a blue discoloration is present. They vary in size from a few millimetres to 3 centimetres. The majority occurs in the head and neck region. On ultrasound a pilomatrixoma presents as an oval tumor lcated between the cutis and subcutis. It is hyperechoic, sometimes with calcification and acoustic shadowing. The wall is often hypoechoic and on color Doppler tiny vessels can be seen in the wall. These images are of a firm mass in the neck of a 17-year-old girl. A cytologic sampling was inconclusive. Ultrasound shows a typical pilomatrixoma, confirmed at pathology after excision. Some perfusion in the wall of the pilomatrixoma is seen. Large pilomatrixoma on the upper arm of a 12-year-old girl.
Salivary glands:
Enlargement of the salivary glands can be diffuse or focal. Diffuse swelling mostly affects the parotid glands. If it is bilateral it can be caused by autoimmune diseases (like Sjögren's disease) or infections (HIV). On ultrasound many small hypoechoic lesions are present. Unilateral swelling can be caused by a bacterial parotitis. Hemangioma is the most common parotid gland tumor of childhood, which involute in the course of a few months.
Teratoma:
Teratomas of the neck are rare in children. Teratomas are composed of all three germ layers. They often present at birth. On ultrasound they are composed of solid and cystic parts and often contain calcifications. They can have a close connection to the thyroid gland. If the extension is unclear MRI can be done. Here we see a midline tumor in the anterior neck of a three-day-old boy. Calcifications and solid and cystic parts are seen. Pathology was compatible with a mature teratoma.
Paraganglioma:
Here images of a 17-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck, thought to represent a branchial cleft cyst. An echogenic solid mass was seen with moderate perfusion on color doppler examination. No specific diagnosis could be made. The final pathologic diagnosis was a paraganglioma, a very uncommon finding in children.
Neurofibroma:
Here a large neurofibroma in the subcutaneous tissue in the neck of a 10-year-old boy with a known neurofibromatosis.
Neuroblastoma:
Neuroblastoma usually presents as an abdominal mass in young children. In the neck it accounts for 1-5% of neuroblastomas. On ultrasound a heterogeneously echogenic mass is seen, often with some calcifications (1). Here a ten-month-old girl with a lump in the neck. Ultrasound shows a inhomogeneous mass with some calcifications. There were also three enlarged lymph nodes with calcifications. Imaging could not make a definitive diagnosis. Pathology showed a neuroblastoma. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Video of neuroblastoma. by Lonergan GJ, Schwab CM,Suarez ES, Carlson CL. Radiographics 2002, 22(4); 911-34

Ligaments:
MR-signs of ligament tear
Anterior Cruciate Ligament:
The ACL has interesting anatomy. It is an intra-articular structure, but it is extra-synovial. The synovium folds over the ligament. So at arthroscopy they look through the synovium. Sometimes when there is a tear ,the synovium layer is intact and only a hemorrhagic ACL is seen. The ACL is composed of 3-5 layers of fibers. Between the fibers there can be fat or synovium or sometimes a little bit of fluid. This explains why the ACL is not black on PD-images. Do not look at the ACL on PD-images because this may give a false impression of pathology. Only look at the ACL on T2W-images and even on these images the ACL does not have to be entirely black. Criteria for the normal ACL are: So on MR the primary signs of a tear are: discontinuity on T2, abnormal orientation or non-visualisation. Many secondary signs of tears have been described, but these are not helpfull, since we have to rely on direct visualisation of the ligament. Only bone bruises can be a helpfull secondary sign. Notice that on coronal and axial images fibers of the ACL are right next to the bone of the intercondylar notch (arrows). There should never be any fluid between these ACL-fibers and the bone of the lateral condyle ('empty notch sign'). Also notice that the PCL is also composed of many fibers. LEFT: Acute ACL-tear. ACL fibers too flat compared to condylar roof.RIGHT: Discontinuity of fibers. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (2). The case on the left shows a ligament that's too flat and we see disrupted fibers so there is abnormal orientation and discontinuity. Based on these images we cannot differentiate between complete tear, high grade partial tear or partial tear. MRI does not accurately differentiate between partial or complete ACL tear. But yes we can differentiate between high grade or low grade injury. A high grade injury is 'not able to see 50% of the fibers'. So if the othopaedic surgeons operate on a high grade injury, they will either find a totally torn ACL or a high grade partial tear, that needs to be repaired. On the other hand if most of the fibers appear to be intact on MR indicating a low grade ACL tear, they will find an intact or partially torn ACL, that is stable and doesn't need any treatment. LEFT: ACL-tear with bone bruises on lateral side. RIGHT: Anterior condyle hits the posterior part of the tibia. ACL torn due to stretching. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (3). Bone bruises appear in a very typical location indicating the dislocation, that was the cause of the ACL-tear. Segond fracture indicating ACL-tear Anterior Cruciate Ligament (4) On X-rays an important indirect sign of an ACL-tear is a Segond fracture. Difficult to see on MR, but much more easy to see on radiographs. A Segond fracture is an avulsion fracture at the attachment of the lateral collateral band due to internal rotation and varus stress. In 75-100% there will also be a tear of the ACL. The unhappy triad or O'Donoghues syndrome is a different combination of injuries. The unhappy triad injury commonly occurs in contact sports such as football when the knee is hit from the outside. This causes an injury to three knee structures: Torn ACL. ACL fibers are too flat (yellow arrow) compared to intercondylar roof (Blumensaat's line). Anterior Cruciate Ligament (5) Case on the left shows a torn ACL. Fibers have an abnormal orientation (too flat). Yet it is difficult to see if these are attached to the femur. The acute angulation in the ligament is due to fact that the ACL and PCL have scarred together (see below). LEFT: ACL-fibers have a normal orientation but do not connect to femurcondyle. RIGHT: Empty notch sign: fluid against the interior part of the lateral condyle Sometimes it is easier to see whether these fibers are attached in the coronal plane. Against the interior part of the lateral condyle there never should be fluid. If this is the case it is called the 'empty notch sign' indicating that the ACL is torn from it's attachment to the femur. In the axial plane there is an empty notch sign (yellow arrows) where there should be ACL attached to the condyle. At a lower level (going right) the torn ACL is scarred to the PCL (green arrows) Also in the axial plane there should be ligament next to the condyle. At a lower level we see the torn ACL attached to the posterior cruciate ligament. They have scarred together. This is a very common appearance of a chronic ACL tear. This scarring leads to the acute angulation of the ligament. Even though the ACL is connected to the PCL it is not strong enough and still needs reconstruction. ACL Mucoid degeneration. This patient had an operation for another reason and the surgeons called it normal because it looks normal. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (6) Case on the left shows a non-visualisation of the ACL on a PD-image. But the lesson is 'do not look at ligaments on a PD-image'. If you want to judge the ACL-ligament look at the T2W-images. The T2W-images show fibers going all the way from the tibia to the femur with a normal orientation. So the ACL is intact. This is a case of mucoid degeneration. Normally between the ACL-fibers there can be synovium or fat. In normal aging that can change into gelatinous material. This has no effect on the strenght of the ACL. ACL Mucoid degeneration with cyst-formation (intra-osseus ganglion). Mucoid material is squeezed from between the ACL-fibers into the bone. At arthroscopy ACL and bone looked normal. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (7) Another case of ACL Mucoid degeneration. Often this is associated with cyst-formation in the bone. You could call it ganglion cyst, but you could also call it normal because it has no clinical meaning. This is part of normal aging. ACL ganglion cyst Anterior Cruciate Ligament (8) Case on the left shows cyst seperate from ACL unlike mucoid degenaration. This is a ganglion cyst. Probably also a form of degeneration. The difference with Mucoid degeneration is that these cysts can be symptomatic. Sometimes these cysts will drained under ultrasound guidance. Be sure to use a very large needle, because it is very thick material. Acute PCL-tear: In the coronal and axial plane most of the fibers are gone so it's a high grade tear.
Posterior Cruciate Ligament:
We use the same criteria for all the other ligaments in the body. The case on the left shows a high grade PCL tear. MCL from medial epicondyle (yellow arrow) to below the inferomedial geniculate vessels (red arrow) about 7 centimetres below the joint space.
Medial collateral ligament:
The superficial medial collateral ligament (MCL) extends from the medial epicondyle to insert not just near the joint but 7 cm below the joint space. At that point there are three landmarks: the inferomedial geniculate artery and paired veins (figure). The deep part of the MCL, even when it is normal, you may not be able to see. It is closely applied to the medial meniscus and the superficial MCL. Grade 1 MCL Sprain Medial collateral ligament (2) The case on the left shows a Grade I sprain of the medial collateral ligament. Grade II MCL Sprain Medial collateral ligament (3) The case on the left shows a Grade II sprain of the medial collateral ligament. Superficial MCL-tear (yellow arrow) and deep MCL tear (orange arrow). Medial collateral ligament (4) The case on the left shows a superficial MCL that is torn from it's attachment on the tibia. Remember it should be attached 7 cm below the joint line. Deep MCL is also torn the ligament is absent. Posterolateral corner anatomy from medial to lateral on sagittal images. Fibular collateral ligament (green) and Biceps femoris tendon (yellow) form a letter V and insert as conjoined tendon on fibular head.
Posterolateral Corner injury:
Normal anatomy Posterolateral corner contains seven or eight structures. Only three of them are important to us because they are visible on MR and because the surgeon might want to fix them. These structures are: Fibular collateral ligament Biceps femoris muscle and tendon. Popliteal tendon The fibular collateral ligament together with the tendon of the biceps femoris form the letter V on sagittal images. They inserts on the fibulahead as the conjoined tendon. LEFT: bone bruise anteromedial. RIGHT: biceps femoris tendon is not attached to the fibula. Posterolateral corner injury (2) On the left a football player, who was hit in the front part of the knee. The image on the far left shows a bone bruise anteromedially. So you suspect ligamentous injury on the contralateral side, which is the posterolateral corner. The next image shows a normal popliteus tendon but biceps femoris tendon is not attached to the fibula. LEFT: distal rupture of fibular collateral ligament.RIGHT: biceps femoris tendon and collateral ligament do not attach. On the left more images of the same patient located more anteriorly. The fibular collateral ligament has a normal proximal attachment but is not attached to the fibula. On a sagittal plane there is a gap between biceps femoris tendon and collateral ligament on one side and the fibular head on the other. These findings indicate a conjoined tendon rupture. LEFT: cruciate lig.rupture (orange), med coll lig rupture (green), proximal rupture of the fibular collateral ligament (blue).RIGHT: no attachment of popliteus tendon (red arrows) Posterolateral corner injury (3) On the left PD-fatsat images after severe injury. There are bone bruises and many ligaments are ruptured. There is a posterolateral corner injury with proximal rupture of the fibular collateral ligament. There is also a rupture of the popliteus tendon because it is not attached proximally.
Cysts, Bursae and Recesses:
LEFT: popliteal cyst originating between semimembranosus tendon (red arrow) and gastrocnemius muscle and tendon (green arrow).RIGHT: ruptured popliteal cyst with fluid tracking down the muscles. There are about 12 named bursae and recesses in the knee. Some very common and others uncommon. These are synovial lined structures. The most common recess is the popliteal or Baker's cyst. The origin is between the semimembranosus and gastrocnemius tendon. Prepatellar bursitis
Prepatellar bursitis:
On the left the typical imaging findings of prepatellar bursitis. Deep infrapatellar bursitis
Deep infrapatellar bursitis:
An uncommon form of bursitis is the deep infrapatellar bursitis. Sometimes associated with Osgood-Schlatter. Medial collateral ligament bursitis located between the deep MCL (yellow arrow) and the superficial MCL (green arrow). These bursae are all named by the structures next to them. So a bursitis of the bursa between the deep MCL and the superficial MCL is called a medial collateral ligament bursitis. Iliotibial Band Friction syndrome: no fat between iliotibial band (yellow arrow) and the lateral condyle. Cysts, Bursae and Recesses (2) Adventitial bursae are bursae, that are formed in places where normally there is no bursa> The bursa is formed due to abnormal friction. Iliotibial Band Friction syndrome A common place for abnormal friction is between the iliotibial band and the lateral condyle in speedwalkers, bicyclists and sometimes runners. When a bursa is formed in this location it is called the 'Iliotibial Band Friction syndrome'. On the left a speedwalker with lateral knee pain. Between iliotibial band and the lateral condyle there should be fat, but in this case it is missing. Iliotibial Band Friction syndrome : Fluid within a bursa is seen between the iliotibial tract and the femur (yellow arrows). Joint fluid stops at the red arrows. Same patient. On axial images fluid within a bursa is seen between the iliotibial tract and the underlying femur. Sometimes fluid in this location has to be differentiated from joint fluid. You have to look at all the images. In this case the joint fluid stops at the red arrows. Patient with a palpable mass. Marker is placed. Enhancing lesion due to a neurofibroma. Remember that not everything that's bright on a T2W-image is fluid. You have to be suspicious, if there is something, that looks like a fluid collection, but it is not in a location, where there normally is a bursa, cyst or recess. Give Gadolineum to differentiate cystic from solid.
Quadriceps and Patellar tendon:
Normal Extensor mechanism: The quadriceps tendon comes in three layers (orange arrow). Patellar tendon (blue arrow) and quadriceps tendon have a sharp posterior demarcation. Normal Extensor mechanism The extensor mechanism of the knee is composed of the quadriceps muscle and tendon, the patella and the patellar tendon. The quadriceps tendon is made of four tendons but comes in three layers on sagittal images. It has a broad attachment all the way from the front of the patella almost to the back. The tendons of the quadriceps aswell as the patellar tendon are homogeneous in signal but don't have to be black on PD-images. They have a sharp posterior demarcation. There should be no focal thickness. Partial quadriceps tendon tear: T2W-images.LEFT: Abnormal attachment of tendon.RIGHT: Most of tendon is retracted (red arrow) deep part (vastus intermedius) is still intact. Quadriceps tendon tear The case on the left shows an abnormal quadriceps attachment. There is only one layer and the attachment does not go from the front of the patella to nearly the back. In such a case extra images higher up have to be made after repositioning of the coil to see what's going on up there. The missing part of the torn quadriceps tendon is retracted. The deep part is still intact LEFT: Torn tendon with pre-existing tendinopathy (red arrow). RIGHT: Intact vastus intermedius tendon. Same patient, axial images. The torn quadriceps tendon is very thick indicating tendinopathy. Normal tendons do not tear, so always look for signs of pre-existing tendinopathy. Anywhere in the body, if you see a tendon that looks torn, but there is no pre-existing tendinopathy, think hard, if you really have the right diagnosis. An image below this level shows normal vastus intermedius muscle and tendon. LEFT: Partial quadriceps tear. Only rectus femoris tendon is torn (blue arrow). RIGHT: Pre-existing tendinopathy (yellow cirkle) on axial image. Another example of a partially torn quadriceps tendon. Complete quadriceps tear. Sag T2W-images. No continuity. Hematoma in between. If there is no continuity between the patella and the quadriceps tendons it is a complete tear. Jumper's Knee Jumper's knee is a spectrum from tendinopathy to tear. Just the same as with the quadriceps tendon or any other tendon the MR shows a spectrum from eccentric tendon thickening, indistinct posterior border, increased signal on T2W-images and finally fiber disruption. Patellar tendinopathy and Partial patellar tendon tear Patellar tendinopathy Patient on the left is a professional ballet dancer with pain underneath the knee cap. Patellar tendon proximally is too thick. Posterior border is indistinct. In patella a little bit of edema ( or bone bruise). If left untreated could end up like...
Partial patellar tendon tear. Image on the right of a different patient. Complete Patellar tendon tear. Image on the right shows hemorrhagic bursitis ( low signal in bursa). Complete Patellar tendon tear. Images on the left show no continuity between fibers and patella. The tendon is thickened. Patellar sleeve avulsion. Fractureline only visible on the coronal images. Patellar sleeve avulsion. In children we have a different situation. They don't develop tendinopathy. The case on the left shows images of a girl who had pain beneath the patella after doing gymnastics. Although the X-ray is normal there accually is a fracture through the cartilage part of the lower pole. On MR it looks just like the jumper's knee above. Only on coronal images the dark fractureline within the bright cartilage is visible. Usually these fractures are sutured. When these lesions are unrecognized they heal with ossification just below the patella.
Patellar dislocation:
Normal anatomy The patellar cartilage is the thickest in the body. It should have smooth contours. The most important part of the medial retinaculum is the medial patellofemoral ligament which inserts all the way posteriorly just in front of the MCL. LEFT: Bone bruise lateral condyle (yellow circle). Normal MCL (green arrow) but missing patellar femoral ligament anterior to it.RIGHT: Medial patellar femoral ligament thorn from femoral attachment. Case on the left is a female soccerplayer who twisted her knee. Four MR-images from caudal to cranial demonstrate all the imaging features of a patellar dislocation with rupture of the medial patellar femoral ligament . The patella was dislocated and the medial facet has bumped onto the lateral condyle. The patella has spontaneously reduced. LEFT: Bone bruise medial patella (green arrow).RIGHT: Cartilage fracture. Bone bruise may be complicated by cartilage fracture. Patellar dislocation (2) Patellar dislocation is a common condition, but clinically often unrecognized because the patella after the dislocation comes back in it's normal position. The patient comes with a swollen painfull knee which could be anything from ACL-, MCL- or meniscal tear to a fracture. So the MRI-findings are important in recognizing this condition. Patients who have loose bodies or continuing dislocation may undergo operation with retinaculum repair.
Bone and Cartilage:

Normal and abnormal bone marrow:
In adults the bone marrow is largely composed of fat. Normal islands of red marrow may produce confusing images. Red bone marrow can be pronounced in young women, cigarette smoking, high altitude, hemoglobinopathy or for no reason at all. As long as the criteria on the left are fullfilled it is normal. Normal red marrow on the left. Restricted to the metaphysis and not into the epiphysis. Comes in islands. On T1 brighter than muscle. Patient with leukemia and abnormal bone marrow Abnormal Bone Marrow Case on the left shows abnormal bone marrow. On T1W the signal intensity is lower than muscle. On T2W-images the signal is very bright. The abnormal signal comes into the epiphysis. Abnormal bone marrow. There is abnormal signal intensity in the form of circles in metaphysis and epiphysis. Another case with abnormal marrow. In this case the marrow is too dark on T1 and T2 due to iron deposition in the marrow after many blood transfusions in a patient with hemosiderosis. Avascular Necrosis: fluid underneath the cartilage just like a crescent sign on a X-ray. Cartilage is normal.
Avascular Necrosis:
The most common marrow abnormality is Avascular Necrosis (AVN). Some people will say 'AVN, Osteochondrosis Dissecans and Stress fracture all look the same'. There is however a distinct difference. AVN has the following features: Focal abnormality is subchondral and originates in the bone. Normal cartilage (until it collapses). Wedge shaped marrow edema due to bone infarction. Wedge-shaped bone infarction in AVN The wedge-shaped pattern of bone marrow edema is just the same as any other infarction in the body i.e. liver infarction or kidney-infarction.
Insufficiency fracture:
On the left a different entity, but the patient had the same symptoms. Acute onset of medial pain. There is diffuse marrow edema on T2W-image. On T1W-image the focal abnormality is not directly subchondral. The abnormality on the T1 is more inside the edema. On the T1W-image a dark line is visible indicating a insufficiency fracture. This patient will get better with no weight bearing. On the left another patient with knee pain after trauma. There is some effusion but otherwise the x-rays are normal. Tibiaplateau fracture. This also is a osteochondral fracture as the fracture line extends all the way through the cartilage to the joint surface. In the same patient the MRI shows an obvious tibiaplateau fracture. The point is that any patient who is unable to bear weight in the hip, knee or ankle with normal X-rays needs another study. Unstable Osteochondritis Dissecans
Osteochondritis Dissecans:
The diagnosis Osteochondritis Dissecans is usually made on X-rays. The question for MRI is whether it is stable or unstable. The case on the left is unstable for two reasons: small cysts at the base of the lesion (red arrow) even more important is fluid at the base of the lesion (blue arrow) Notice that this layer of fluid is different from AVN where the fluid is between the cartilage and the bone. Unstable Osteochondritis Dissecans. The only helpfull sign for the diagnosis unstable OD is the fluid (yellow arrow) not the edema nor the break in the osteochondral surface (green arrow). Not helpfull for the discussion stable versus unstable OD are bone marrow edema (could be stable or unstable) break in the osteochondral surface. So the case on the left is unstable because there is fluid at the base of the lesion. The case on the left shows a OD with bone marrow edema and a break in the osteochondral surface. But since there is no fluid we cannot tell if this is stable or unstable. At operation the OD was found to be stable In those cases where you cannot tell whether the lesion is stable or unstable MR-arthrogram is helpfull. We look for Gadolineum tracking around the osteochondral lesion.

Pulmonary Fibrosis:

A stepwise approach to fibrosis on HRCT:
Onno Mets, Lilian Meijboom and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Amsterdam University Medical Center and Alrijne hospital Leiderdorp:
Publicationdate 1-7-2021 In this article we will discuss lung diseases with a reticular pattern and provide a guidance for radiologists to evaluate the most common diseases and their patterns. 
A stepwise approach is presented to identify the key features in fibrotic lung disease and to make it easier to reach a differential diagnosis. Images can be enlarged by clicking on them. We would like to thank Nestor L. Müller for his comments on the
manuscript draft.
Lung anatomy:
Lung anatomy showing secondary lobules and the axial and peripheral interstitium. The anatomy of reticular lung disease is all about the pulmonary interstitium, which is a continuum that comprises both a peripheral and axial component (fig). The peripheral interstitium supports the distal secondary lobules and involves the subpleural and perifissural areas, whereas the axial interstitium supports the bronchovascular structures from the hilum towards the periphery. The interstitium also contains the lung lymphatics. Under normal circumstances the interstitium itself is below the resolution of CT.
Thickening of the interstitium is the underlying mechanism of a reticular pattern. The Fleischner glossary of terms [1] defines reticulation as “a collection of innumerable small linear opacities that, by summation, produces an appearance resembling a net”.
Stepwise Approach:
The
first step is to determine whether reticulation really represents fibrosis. The
next step is to determine if it is definite, probable or indeterminate UIP
pattern, or an alternative pattern. If
it is definite or probable UIP, one needs to realize that not all UIP equals
idiopathic lung fibrosis, as UIP with/without honeycombing can also be seen in
fibrotic sarcoid, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and end stage connective
tissue disease related-ILD (CTD-ILD).
Step 1 - Is it really fibrosis?:
Click to enlarge Fibrosis causes traction on surrounding structures and will lead to: Hence, these are the first features to look for when assessing whether the reticulation represents lung fibrosis or not. The images show fibrotic lung disease with distortion of the secondary lobule, volume loss and traction bronchiectasis (green is normal, yellow is abnormal). Pulmonary edema (A), Lymphangitic carcinomatosa (B), EGPA (C). Not
all reticulation is fibrosis, as the pulmonary interstitium can be thickened by
other pathology. Most
commonly this is: The
images show examples of non-fibrotic reticulation due to interstitial
thickening in pulmonary edema (A), lymphangitic carcinomatosis (B), and
eosinophilic infiltration in eosinophilic granulomatis with polyangitis [EGPA,
former Churg-Strauss syndrome] (C).
ILA -interstitial lung abnormalities:
Incidental mild interstitial changes – in patients clinically not suspected of ILD – have been named ‘interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA)’. These indeterminate and minor changes may represent an early stage of fibrotic interstitial lung disease, but may also just represent some post-infectious scarring or mild smoking- or age-related interstitial changes. A cut-off of 5% lung involvement has been suggested as a discriminator for significant disease [2], however, accurate visual assessment is very difficult. Follow-up may show whether or not it is a relevant incidental finding, which is optional and depending on patient characteristics.
Step 2 – UIP pattern:
A
UIP pattern is based on the disease gradient, distribution of the fibrosis and
absence of another dominant HRCT pattern. Another
HRCT pattern like ground-glass, lung cysts, centrilobular or perilymphatic
nodules and consolidation should be absent, since these are associated with
other underlying disease and point away from a UIP/IPF diagnosis. First the fibrosis has to show a gradient towards the lung bases, with the lower lobes and costophrenic angles more extensively involved than the mid and upper lung zones. The fibrosis may be somewhat more anterior in the mid/upper lung zones, which has been named the ‘propeller sign’, after the twist that is present in a propeller blade. The images show a basal and subpleural dominant pattern in A versus an apical and central dominant fibrotic disease in B. Subpleural dominant (A), subpleural sparing (B), and peribronchial dominant (C) patterns of fibrosis. Second, the fibrosis has to be subpleural dominant. This means that the disease targets the peripheral interstitium and involves the lung directly beneath the pleura.
It should not spare the subpleural lung tissue, nor should it centre around the bronchovascular bundle (ie. predominantly involve the axial interstitium).
UIP classification:
There are specific imaging guidelines for UIP/IPF evaluation - issued by both a collaboration of worldwide Thoracic Societies (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT) as well as by the Fleischner Society [3,4]. 
The bottom line of both guidelines is that HRCT imaging should reach a conclusion of either: In a patient with basal and subpleural dominant fibrosis, without inconsistent ancillary features, the presence or absence of honeycombing determines whether to assign a definite or probable UIP pattern. 
However, honeycombing assessment may suffer from substantial interobserver variability, even among experts [5]. 
Honeycombing on CT imaging is defined as “subpleural oriented clustered cystic air spaces, typically on the order of 3-10 mm”. 
Note is made that it is different from the honeycombing seen on histopathology, which is defined as “destroyed and fibrotic lung tissue containing numerous cystic airspaces with thick fibrous walls, with complete loss of acinar architecture” [1].
Although both represent established and severe fibrosis, they are seen at significantly different levels of magnification. Definite UIP (A) and probable UIP (B). In A there is honeycombing combined with basal and subpleural dominant fibrosis indicating a definite UIP pattern. In B there is a probable UIP pattern without honeycombing. The ongoing process of honeycombing formation. There is a spectrum ranging from normal lung tissue (A), through distortion of the secondary lobule with traction bronchiolectasis (B), to end stage cyst formation (C). Honeycombing
is the result of progressive fibrosis with architectural distortion and is at
the end of the scale from normal lung tissue, through distortion of the
secondary lobule with traction bronchiolectasis, to end stage cyst
formation. Although
the presence of honeycombing defines the difference between a probable and
definite UIP pattern, honeycombing is not pathognomonic for idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF) as it is just a feature of severe fibrosis. Honeycombing
may also be present in the fibrotic (end-)stages of sarcoidosis, NSIP and
hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In short, a UIP pattern does not equal IPF. But,
in the correct clinical setting ina patient clinically suspected of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) a UIP pattern will seal the case (ie. diagnosis of
UIP/IPF), eliminating the need for further invasive diagnostics like cryo- or
surgical lung biopsy.
Step 3 - Alternative Patterns:

- Axial and non-basal distribution:
Axial and non-basal distribution When
the interstitial disease is not mainly subpleural but rather predominantly
peribronchial, the two main considerations are fibrotic chronic hypersensitivity
pneumonitis (HP) and sarcoidosis. Apical
dominance is often seen in sarcoidosis, but only in a minority of cases of
chronic HP. Typical fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis showing diffuse non-basal dominant (A), peribronchial orientated ground-glass and mild fibrotic changes with mosaicism (A and B), and expiratory air trapping (C).
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis:
Typical
fibrotic chronic HP is characterized by peribronchial fibrosis with various
degrees of ground-glass and marked mosaic attenuation due to sparing of
secondary lobules. Expiratory
air trapping due to small airways obstruction is a hallmark finding. Centrilobular
ground-glass nodules may be present, but are more often and dominantly seen in
the subacute (non-fibrotic) stages of the disease. The
fibrosis may show a random or diffuse distribution, or a mid- or upper lung
predominance with relative sparing of the bases. Fibrotic sarcoidosis with peribronchovascular and apical dominant disease
Sarcoidosis:
Sarcoidosis
is the great mimicker. The
fibrosis in sarcoidosis typically shows peribronchovascular and mid to upper
lung zone predominance with architectural distortion and central traction bronchiectasis,
a varying amount of reticulation and, occasionally, even honeycombing. While
sarcoidosis initially typically manifests with bilateral hilar and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, in the late fibrotic stage of the disease the nodes are usually
normal in size and calcified. The
images show typical fibrotic sarcoidosis with peribronchovascular and apical
dominant disease, showing (confluent) nodularity, reticulation and mild ground-glass, as well as extensive traction bronchiectasis.
- Ground-glass pattern and Consolidation:
Ground-glass Although some ground-glass may be seen in areas of reticulation – a finding that does not exclude the diagnosis of probable UIP pattern - dominant ground glass component suggests an alternative diagnosis. Ground-glass may point to a wide range of diseases, including connective tissue disease (CTD) related ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, as well as smoking-related and drug-related ILD.
Ground-glass is often a feature of non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. Pure ground-glass without fibrotic changes is the hallmark feature of cellular NSIP, separated from fibrotic NSIP pattern in which there is reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion due to fibrosis. NSIP is typically basal dominant with marked ground-glass, reticulation and traction bronchiolectasis. Subpleural sparing of the dorsal regions of the lower lobes is present in (only) approximately 40% of cases and may be a helpful feature in making the diagnosis. Consolidations Consolidations are not part of a probable UIP pattern. Small focal areas of fibrosis may be seen in UIP, however, more significant consolidation in HRCT imaging is often due to organizing pneumonia component and suggests a diagnosis other than UIP/IPF.
Active pulmonary infection or malignancy should always be considered.
Connective tissue disease related ILD:
The table shows the imaging patterns in connective tissue disease related interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD), where font size correlates to imaging pattern frequency. CTD-ILD can result in many different patterns.
Within the overall heterogeneous group, disease manifestation with NSIP pattern as well as other components such as arcade-like consolidations due to OP (organizing pneumonia) or cysts due to LIP (lymphoid interstitial pneumonia) may hint toward a specific diagnosis (see Table). NSIP in Sjögren’s disease
NSIP:
Classic
fibrotic NSIP pattern in Sjögren’s disease with
fibrotic changes and dominant ground-glass in a basal dominant pattern that
extends somewhat more centrally. Subpleural
sparing is not a dominant feature in this case. ibrotic NSIP in anti-synthetase syndrome The images show a combination of basal dominant groundglass and traction bronchiectasis, combined with limited perilobular arcade-like consolidations due to co-existing organizing pneumonia (OP). The final diagnosis was fibrotic NSIP in anti-synthetase syndrome. Anti-synthetase syndrome is an immune-mediated multisystem disorder that can include (among others) interstitial lung disease, myositis and/or polyarthritis, skin changes and Raynaud’s phenomenon. UIP pattern in Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid Arthritis:
Severe fibrotic changes in a subpleural and basal dominant orientation, with extensive honeycombing, consistent with a UIP pattern due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatoid arthritis can show multicompartment involvement and result in airways disease, pleural disease and interstitial lung disease, most commonly with a UIP pattern.
Smoking-related ILD:
Smoking-related interstitial lung disease is a difficult subgroup which typically shows profound emphysema with milder superimposed fibrotic changes, more diffuse or apical dominant abnormalities, less severe basal volume loss and more ground-glass when compared to (probable) UIP pattern. However, smoking-related changes of the lung often coincides with other interstitial lung disease as a substantial number of ILD patients are (former) smokers. Smokers rarely suffer from chronic HP, while it is an individual risk factor for UIP/IPF.
Smoking-related interstitial fibrosis (SRIF) and combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) are regularly used terms, however, as radiological patterns not strictly defined.
Drug-induced ILD:
Drug-induced interstitial lung disease is a difficult subgroup with often non-specific imaging features.
It should always be considered in every differential diagnosis, especially in cases showing a non-UIP pattern.
Classically, drug-induced ILD is associated with dominant ground-glass and/or organizing pneumonia consolidation pattern, more than frank fibrosis. Methotrexate, Amiodarone and Nitrofurantoin are well-known examples of pneumotoxic drugs, although a near endless list has been recognized.
Compared to the past decades, the increasing use of immunotherapy will likely lead us to encountering drug-induced pneumonitis patterns more often.
See www.pneumotox.com for more information on pneumotoxic drugs and their reported associated imaging patterns.
Radiologically non-classifiable disease:
Not uncommonly HRCT findings do not conform to one of the well known radiological patterns. 
This may be due to limited and nonspecific interstitial changes, or due to a combination of features that are truly indeterminate. 
For example, there may be subpleural dominant reticulation and traction bronchiectasis, but without a clear gradient or questionable groundglass component and no other ancillary findings to suggest a specific diagnosis. It is often felt to be an act of weakness to not conclude on an imaging pattern, however, it is stressed that “radiologically non-classifiable disease” is also a valid conclusion of the HRCT report. 
In fact, it is much better than “possibly UIP, differential NSIP or HP”.
Multidisciplinary approach:
Diagnosing a classic disease based on typical imaging findings is not that common. 
Instead, it is more common to have a differential diagnosis as imaging features may be nonspecific. 
In a multidisciplinary team imaging findings can be correlated to clinical information, pulmonary function test, lab results, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsy findings to reach a consensus diagnosis and treatment plan.
Clinical information:
During
the evaluation of an ILD patient clinical information is gathered (table) Despite
that for example over 200 agents have been associated with chronic
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, yield of occupational and environmental exposure
analysis is unfortunately often limited.
Pulmonary Function Tests:
A basic understanding of pulmonary function test mechanics is helpful. 
There are three major components in lung function testing: Index parameters in static lung volume assessment are: Typically, lung volumes are decreased in restrictive lung disease (eg. lung fibrosis, neuromuscular disease) and increased in obstructive lung disease (eg. COPD, asthma). DLCO measures the capacity for carbon monoxide gas exchange, and is a surrogate marker for the ability of oxygen to be delivered to the blood. 
DLCO is directly proportional to the alveolar-capillary membrane surface area and inversely proportional to alveolar-capillary membrane thickness. 
Typically, DLCO is decreased in diseases that either lower the membrane surface area (eg. emphysema, thromboembolic disease) or thicken the membrane over which diffusion takes place (eg. lung fibrosis). The classic PFT pattern in lung fibrosis is restrictive, showing relatively normal spirometry with decreased lung volumes and DLCO.
However, a mixed pattern can be seen if patients who have both restrictive and obstructive disease components. 
For example, advanced stages of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis or sarcoidosis may show both small airway disease and lung fibrosis simultaneously. 
Also, summative contributions of emphysema and fibrosis in ‘combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema’ (CPFE) may lead to ‘pseudo-normalisation’ of spirometry and lung volumes, while clinical symptoms and DLCO are usually profoundly abnormal.
Laboratory analysis:
The search for inflammatory markers and auto-antibodies are part of standard ILD evaluation. 
It is important to realize that the presence of an auto-antibody does not equal a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease. 
Rather, a positive serology helps to support a diagnosis if accompanied by appropriate clinical signs and symptoms. Common biomarkers are:
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL):
Immunologic BAL is a diagnostic procedure to retrieve respiratory secretions.
There is limited value of BAL results in UIP/IPF diagnosis, other than exclusion of other underlying aetiologies.
Pathology:
If there is still no diagnosis after clinical evaluation, CT imaging and additional diagnostic tests, the MDT may decide that a lung biopsy is needed. 
This is however highly dependent on the patient’s wishes, co-morbidities and the available treatment options, as the procedure carries a relative high risk of complications and mortality. Most often a video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) surgical lung biopsy is performed, in which typically three samples are taken from each lobe of the right lung. 
A more recent option is an endoscopic cryobiopsy, however, yield is often suboptimal compared to surgical biopsies. The final diagnosis of IPF is based on the findings on HRCT in combination with the histopathology (table).
Treatment and follow-up:
ILD patients are most often followed with PFT and HRCT imaging to assess for disease progression. 
Depending on the final diagnosis, medical therapy may be available. 
A dichotomous split of therapeutic options is anti-fibrotic medication (in primarily fibrotic lung disease such as IPF) vs. immunosuppressive therapy (in immune-mediated fibrotic lung disease such as chronic HP or CTD-related ILD). Medication may be combined with termination of exposure to antigens or pneumotoxic drug, smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, etc. A lung transplantation may be the ultimate endeavour, if available.
Esophagus II: Strictures, Acute syndromes, Neoplasms and Vascular impressions.:
Terrence C. Demos, MD, Harold V. Posniak, MD, Wayde Nagamine, MD and Mary Olson, MD
Department of Radiology of the Loyola University Medical Center, USA:
Publicationdate 2007-12-07 In Esophagus II we will discuss: Vascular impressions. Strictures
Strictures:
The table shows common and uncommon causes of esophageal strictures. To the far left is an image of a stricture (arrow) with irregular mucosal folds at stricture site on air-contrast view. This patient had Barrett's esophagus. Mid esophageal strictures and ulcers are suspicious for Barrett's esophagus. The two images on the right show a Barrett's esophagus with an irregular stricture due to adenocarcinoma. Here an image of a long, symmetric tapered benign stricture months after radiotherapy. Here are images of a patient with a benign stricture high in the esophagus (arrow). There is bilateral lower lobe lung consolidation due to repeated aspiration. Approximately 5,000-15,000 cases of caustic ingestion occur in the US every year. About 50%-80% occur in the pediatric population. On the left a high stricture (arrow) following caustic ingestion Osteophytes (arrow) can impinge on the esophagus and hypopharynx. However they rarely cause symptoms. Multiple structures are uncommon. The table shows diseases that may present with multiple esophageal strictures. Benign pemphigoid Here is an image of a patient with benign pemphigoid. Mucosal bullae have led to multiple strictures (arrows). Epidermolysis bullosa This image is of a patient with benign epidermolysis bullosa. Multiple strictures (arrows) are a residual of mucosal bullous disease. Extensive bullous skin disease has led to webbed fingers and contractions. Corrosive ingestion Corrosive ingestion can result in multiple strictures.
Acute esophageal syndromes:
In the table on the left are etiologies of an acute esophageal syndrome.
Boerhaave syndrome:
Boerhaave syndrome is rupture of the esophageal wall. It is most often caused by excessive vomiting in eating disorders such as bulimia although it may rarely occur in extremely forceful coughing or other situations, such as obstruction by food. Boerhaave syndrome is a transmural or full-thickness perforation of the esophagus, distinct from Mallory-Weiss syndrome, a nontransmural esophageal tear also associated with vomiting. These syndromes are distinct from iatrogenic perforation, which accounts for 85-90% of cases of esophageal rupture, typically as a complication of an endoscopic procedure, feeding tube, or unrelated surgery. This image is of a patient with Boerhaave syndrome. Chest radiographs show pneumomediastinum (arrows). Esophagram with extravasated water soluble contrast material in left hemithorax (asterisk) Perforation is almost always on the left side of distal esophagus. Radiographs show mediastinal gas, effusion, and later pneumothorax. Esophagram is used to confirm leak, first with water-soluble contrast, then barium if no leak is demonstrated. Boerhaave's syndrome On the left a patient with Boerhaave syndrome. The barium study shows extraluminal gas (arrow) without contrast extravasation. CT shows extraluminal gas (arrows). Rent of distal left esophagus confirmed at surgery. CT can show small amounts of extraluminal gas or extravasation not visible on radiographs or esophagram.
Mallory-Weiss tear:
A Mallory-Weiss tear results from prolonged and forceful vomiting, coughing or convulsions. Typically the mucous membrane at the junction of the esophagus and the stomach develops lacerations which bleed, evident by bright red blood in vomitus, or bloody stools. It may occur as a result of excessive alcohol ingestion. This is an acute condition which usually resolves within 10 days without special treatment. Mallory-Weiss tear On the left a patient with a Mallory-Weiss tear. Spot films show barium (arrows) in linear mucosal tear near gastroesophageal junction. Tears may be in distal esophagus, gastric fundus, or extend across the GE junction.
Esophageal hematoma:
These unusual lesions have been associated with increased esophageal
intraluminal pressure, most often vomiting, instrumentation, and anticoagulation
or bleeding disorders. Some are spontaneous. Blunt trauma is a rare cause. Hematomas are self-limited and almost never progress to perforation. Most esophageal hematomas resolve in 1-2 weeks with conservative treatment. On the left a patient with an esophagus hematoma. He presented with chest pain and dysphagia after vomiting. Aside from tortuous aorta chest radiograph is normal. The barium study shows a narrowed lumen (arrows) on AP view and flattened lumen on lateral view (arrowheads) suggestive of a intramural hematoma. On CT the diagnosis of an intramural hematoma was confirmed. A high density mural hematoma (arrowhead) is seen next to NG tube (arrow). Following conservative treatment, six months later the barium study was normal. On the left a patient who had a complicated endoscopy. Instrumentation caused a mucosal tear and dissecting intramural hematoma resulting in double lumen with separating stripe of mucosa (arrows). On the far left an intramural extravasation (arrow) after distal dilation for achalasia. In the middle an intramural extravasation (arrow) after complicated endoscopy. On the right a perforation after biopsy with extravasation of contrast material (arrow).
Benign neoplasms:
Here a list of benign esophageal masses. Esophageal leiomyoma
Leiomyomas:
Leiomyomas are the most common benign esophageal neoplasm and are often large yet nonobstructive. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are least common in the esophagus. On the left an asymptomatic patient with a leiomyoma. On the chest film an abnormal opacity is seen behind the heart (arrow). The barium study demonstrates a lobulated mass (arrow) that does not obstruct despite its large size. Esophageal leiomyoma Mucosal lesions are indicated by mucosal irregularities. Submucosal intramural lesions produce smooth filling defects, and in profile, the margins often form close to a right angle with the esophageal wall. Extrinsic lesions tend to form longer obtuse angles if not fixed to the esophageal wall, and their epicenter may be outside the esophagus. In practice, the location of a lesion may be difficult to determine. On radiograph, tumor (arrows) protrudes into azygoesophageal recess. On esophagram, the inferior margin of this intramural lesion forms close to a right angle (arrow) with esophageal wall. Calcified esophageal leiomyoma A calcified esophageal mass is almost always a leiomyoma. On the left a patient with a calcified esophageal lesion (arrows) protrudes into azygoesophageal recess on radiograph. Lesion (arrow) on CT and surgical specimen radiograph showing calcification. On the left a patient with granular cell myoblastomas, an uncommon benign tumor. These two lesions (arrows) are nonspecific in appearance, but the proximal lesion does demonstrate overhanging and right angle margins indicating mural location. Pedunculated fibrovascular polyps
Fibrovascular polyp:
Pedunculated fibrovascular polyps are rare lesions, that are difficult to diagnose on esophagrams. Their movement during the examination produces an inconstant position. Their shape may be suggestive as in this patient. The stalk is often difficult to identify.
Duplication:
On the left a patient with an esophageal duplication. The findings on the barium study are non-specific. Lesion (arrows) is visible behind the heart on radiograph. Esophageal narrowing (arrows) is caused by duplication. A foregut duplication cyst is a congenital cyst. In the case on the left it displaces hypopharynx and opacified esophagus (arrow) posteriorly and trachea and larynx (asterisk) anteriorly.
Malignant neoplasms:
Here a list of malignant esophageal masses. Early and small esophageal carcinoma are not synonymous. Early esophageal carcinoma is limited to the mucosa, submucosa with no lymph node metastases. Most are small ( Small esophageal carcinoma is defined by the size of the lesion, a diameter So an early carcinoma may be small, but a small carcinoma may be invasive or metastatic and thus not an early carcinoma. This image is of a patient with an early esophageal carcinoma. Lesion is not visible on single contrast esophagram. Air-contrast esophagram shows surface irregularity (arrows) indicating a mucosal lesion. This was both a small lesion and a pathologically early squamous carcinoma. LEFT: Small polypoid carcinoma. RIGHT: Large polypoid lesion. Advanced carcinoma has many gross appearances: On the left two cases of polypoid carcinoma. Esophageal carcinoma with ulcerations (arrows) and sharp right angle junction with esophageal wall (arrowheads) This image is of a patient with an infiltrative ulcerated carcinoma. This lesion has an abrupt transition forming an acute angle and overhanging edge. This indicates mural involvement and is different than obtuse angles usually produced by extrinsic lesions that are not fixed to the esophagus. Varicoid carcinoma These images are of a patient with a varicoid carcinoma. Unchanging appearance of filling defects indicate tumor rather than varices. Note sharp upper margin of lesion and ulceration (arrows) LEFT: Varicoid carcinoma. RIGHT: Superficial spreading carcinoma. To the far left an image of a patient with a varicoid carcinoma. Long lobulations simulate varices but did not vary during fluoroscopy. Note large irregular folds and soft tissue mass (arrow) of gastric fundus Next to it an image of a patient with a superficial spreading carcinoma. Extensive superficial spread involves distal esophagus. This appearance can be seen with both early and advanced lesions. LEFT: Long irregular distal stricture due to carcinomaRIGHT: Distal narrowing is not tapered and more proximal than achalasia. Irregularity (arrow) at narrowed site is subtle but persistent On the far left a patient with a carcinoma with stricture. An irregular, asymmetric stricture is highly suggestive of carcinoma. Smoothly tapered, symmetric strictures are characteristic of a benign etiology, but malignant strictures can have similar characteristics and mimic benign lesions. Next to it a patient with a carcinoma with stricture resembling achalasia. Distal esophageal malignancy may closely resemble achalasia. If esophageal motility is normal, achalasia can be excluded. If abnormal, however, subtle imaging features; asymmetric, irregular, abrupt, or high narrowing, mucosal abnormality, or fixed abnormality suggest diagnosis. On the left another case of pseudoachalasia. Distal narrowing simulates achalasia, but narrowing is eccentric, shoulders are asymmetric (arrows), and the mucosa is irregular at the tip of narrowing. CT shows gastric fundus thickening (arrows) due to adenocarcinoma. Tracheoesophageal stripe Width of the juxtaposed posterior tracheal and anterior esophageal walls > 5 mm on a lateral chest radiograph is suspicious for pathology, most often esophageal carcinoma or achalasia. On the left a patient with a widened 1 cm stripe (arrows). Esophagram shows widened stripe (arrows) and irregular margins of midesophageal carcinoma. CT shows abnormal soft tissue dorsal to trachea. The tumor invades mediastinum adjacent to aortic arch (arrow) Barrett's esophagus with ulcerated (arrow) adenocarcinoma
Barrett's esophagus and Adenocarcinoma:
Barrett's esophagus is a proven risk factor for the development of an adenocarcinoma. The incidence of cancer in Barrett's however is controversial. Who, how, and when individuals should be screened is unresolved. Adenocarcinoma was 10% of esophageal malignancies in 1960s. Since 1960s, incidence increasing in USA greater than any other carcinoma. Incidence now approaching or exceeding squamous carcinoma in Caucasian men in the USA and Europe. On the left a patient with an ulcerated (arrow) plaque like adenocarcinoma in a Barrett's esophagus. Primary gastric fundus adenocarcinoma can invade the esophagus, but means of differentiating invasion from a primary esophageal tumor are a subject of debate. On the left a patient with a gastric fundus adenocarcinoma. The barium study demonstrates marked irregular thickening of distal esophagus and folds at gastroesophageal junction. CT shows thickened irregular lesser curvature wall (arrows) near gastroesophageal junction. Spindle cell carcinoma Spindle cell carcinomas are rare neoplasms, also called carcinosarcomas. They are often bulky but nonobstructive as in the case on the left. Leiomyosarcomas and rare primary melanomas of the esophagus also tend to be bulky but do not cause significant obstruction. Leiomyosarcoma of the esophagus On the left a patient with a leiomyosarcoma of the esophagus. Margin (arrows) of bulky lesion visible on chest radiograph. Lateral view of esophagram shows marked irregularity and esophageal narrowing (arrows). Leiomyosarcoma of the esophagus On the left another patient with a leiomyosarcoma of the esophagus. Large lesion distorts esophageal lumen. CT shows lesion distorting but not obstructing esophageal lumen (arrow). Esophageal obstruction due to metastatic mediastinal lymphnodes. On the left three patients with esophageal narrowing as a result of metastatic mediastinal lymphnodes. On the far left a bronchogenic carcinoma. Extrinsic mediastinal lymph nodes produce long obtuse angles at the interface with esophagus. In the middle another bronchogenic carcinoma. Irregular distal esophageal wall due to invasion of esophagus. In the right a patient with a breast carcinoma. There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy with esophageal invasion and obstruction. LEFT: normal esophagusRIGHT: Mediastinal nodes (arrows) displace esophagus to right Due not confuse normal esophageal irregularities for impressions by lymphnodes. On the left a normal esophagus. The esophagus (arrow) protrudes under aortic arch into right side of AP window. Next to it mediastinal nodes (arrows) that displace the esophagus to right in a patient with bronchogenic carcinoma.
Vascular impressions:
On the left a list of vascular structures that may cause impressions on the esophagus. Uphill varices in a patient with cirrhosis.
Uphill varices:
With portal hypertension, elevated portal venous pressure leads to reversed (hepatofugal) flow bypassing the liver through the left gastric vein to dilated esophageal and periesophageal veins that anastamose with the azygos and hemiazygos veins which drain uphill into the superior vena cava. Filling defects due to varices are characterized by change in appearance during the examination related to breath holding and thoracic pressure. On the left are CT images of a patient with large Uphill varices secondary to cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Large mediastinal and esophageal (arrows) varices On the left CT images of a patient with uphill varices. LEFT: Retrocardiac mass-like varices (arrow). RIGHT: Esophagram showing varices (arrows) Uphill varices can be mass-like as seen in the case on the left. Continue with next image. Mediastinal varices (blue arrows) and esophageal varices (red arrow) The CT shows mass-like mediastinal and esophageal varices (arrows). Varicoid carcinoma Varices have to be differentiated from varicoid carcinoma. On the left the fixed appearance of filling defects indicates tumor rather than varices. Note sharp upper margin of lesion (arrows) Downhill varices in a patient with a superior vena cava obstruction Downhill Varices With superior vena caval obstruction, upper body venous blood flows caudally downhill through esophageal veins to the azygos vein which empties into the superior vena cava caudal to the obstruction. If the obstruction is at or below the azygos, the blood flow extends further caudally to the portal system and then the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava and the right atrium. On the left downhill varices in a patient with a superior vena cava obstruction due to histoplasmosis. On the barium study inconstant filling defects (arrows) represent downhill varices in upper esophagus. The angiogram demonstrates collateral vessels including a dilated left superior intercostal vein (arrow). Downhill varices in a patient with a superior vena cava obstruction The barium study demonstrates inconstant filling defects (blue arrows) due to downhill varices in upper esophagus. CT demonstrates esophageal (red arrow) and mediastinal varices. Continue with venogram. Upper arm venograms show SVC obstruction. Aberrant right subclavian artery
Aberrant right subclavian artery:
This is the most common thoracic arterial anomaly and rarely causes symptoms. The artery extends up and to the right producing a dorsal diagonal impression on the esophagus (arrows). The CT demonstrates that the aberrant artery (arrow) is last vessel from arch and extends dorsal to trachea and esophagus. Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery
Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery:
A right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery is most often an incidental finding. A right aortic arch with mirror-image branching however is almost always associated with congenital heart disease. CT shows right arch (R) and aberrant left subclavian artery (arrow) arising low off arch and extending to left dorsal to esophagus and trachea. On the left the esophagram of a patient with a right arch that produces a dorsal indentation on this lateral view (blue arrow). The diagram shows the aberrant left subclavian artery (L SCA) dorsal to the trachea and esophagus. Double ArchLEFT: Right and left arch indent esophagus (arrows) at different levels RIGHT: Angiogram with double arch in asymptomatic 65-year-old
Double Arch:
Double arch most often presents with airway obstruction, dysphagia, aspiration in children. The arches indent esophagus at different levels. Double Arch On the left another double arch. Chest radiograph with right lung consolidation due to aspiration in 6-year-old. Right and left arch indent esophagus (arrows) at different levels Aberrant left pulmonary artery: aberrant artery extends between trachea and esophagus indenting both (arrows)
Aberrant left pulmonary artery:
The aberrant left pulmonary artery indents the trachea dorsally and esophagus ventrally as it extends between them. Narrowing of right bronchus can cause air trapping or atelectasis. Tortuous aorta A tortous descending aorta is a common cause of extrinsic impression on the esophagus. The image on the far left shows a narrowed distal esophagus. Oblique view shows esophageal indentation by aorta with obtuse margins (arrows) characteristic of extrinsic compression. Normal and abnormal aortic arch impression on the esophagus Aortic pathology On the far left the normal aortic arch impression on the esophagus. This impression can be enlarged if there is dilatation of the aorta as seen in this patient with a mycotic aortic arch aneurysm (arrows). Coarctation: 'Reverse figure 3' indention of esophagus
Coarctation:
On the left 3 images of a patient with a coarctation. On the chest film the 'Figure 3' shape of aortic knob due pre and post stenotic dilatation (arrows). The barium study demonstrates the 'Reverse 3 figure' indention of esophagus by pre and post stenotic aortic dilatation (arrows). An angiogram demonstrates a coarctation with pre and post stenotic dilatation in another patient. by Gore RM, Levine MS.

Prostate Cancer - PI-RADS v2.1:
Georgios Agrotis, Rhiannon van Loenhout, Frank Zijta, Robin Smithuis and Ivo Schoots
Radiology Department of University Hospital of Larissa in Greece and the Haaglanden MC, Alrijne Hospital and Erasmus MC in the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2018-08-01. Update 2023-07-01 The introduction of the PI-RADS classification for prostate MRI in 2012 lead to a more standardized acquisition, interpretation and reporting of prostate MRI.
The PI-RADS Steering Committee has recommended several modifications to the PI-RADS version 2.0. 
Because the overall framework of the system is maintained, the updated version is termed PI-RADS version 2.1 rather than version 3. Modifications
in the new version include: Modifications to the version 2.0 will be highlighted. For the prostate anatomy click here.
Introduction:
The PI-RADS assessment categories are based on the findings of multiparametric MRI, which is a combination of T2-weighted (T2W), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging.
It is an accurate tool in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. In PI-RADS v2.1 clinically significant cancer is defined on pathology as: Gleason score
The Gleason score is used by pathologists to grade prostate cancers.
If the cancer cells and their growth patterns look very abnormal, a grade 5 is assigned. The Gleason score is the sum of the two most prevalent patterns.
These 2 grades are added to yield the Gleason score. The highest Gleason score therefore is 10.
For example, if the Gleason score is written as 3+4=7, it means that most of the tumor is grade 3 and the second most common or most malignant grade is 4.
PI-RADS version 2.1:
This is the PI-RADS version 2.1.
Changes from the old version 2.0 are indicated in light red. Assignment of a PI-RADS assessment category for each lesion is based on the scoring of T2W, DWI/ADC, and DCE sequences, according to zonal anatomy.
Since the dominant sequence for PI-RADS assessment in the peripheral zone is different from the transition zone, identification of the zonal location of a lesion is vital. Peripheral zone (PZ)The peripheral zone is situated on
the posterior and lateral side of the prostate, surrounding the transition
zone.
For the peripheral zone the DWI/ADC
is the primary determining sequence (dominant technique) to assign the PI-RADS
assessment category.
A lesion assessed as suspicion category
3 based on ADC/DWI, remains a PI-RADS score 3 if there is no focal enhancement (negative),
however, it becomes a PI-RADS score 4 if there is focal enhancement (positive). Changes in PI-RADS version 2.1: Transition zone (TZ)The transition zone surrounds the
prostatic urethra and enlarges in aging men as a result of benign prostatic
hyperplasia.
For the transition zone the T2W
imaging is the primary determining sequence (dominant technique) to assign the
PI-RADS assessment category.
A lesion assessed as category 2 based
on T2W images remains PI-RADS score 2 if the DWI/ADC is ≤ 3, however it becomes PI-RADS score 3 if the DWI is ≥ 4.
A lesion assessed as category 3 based
on T2W images remains PI-RADS score 3 if the DWI is ≤ 4, however, it becomes a PI-RADS score 4 if the DWI/ADC is score 5. Changes in PI-RADS version 2.1: Peripheral zone (PZ)
A lesion assessed as suspicion category 3 based on DWI/ADC, remains a PI-RADS score 3 if there is no focal enhancement (negative), however, it becomes a PI-RADS score 4 if there is focal enhancement (positive). Transition zone (TZ)
A lesion assessed as category 2 based on T2W images remains PI-RADS score 2 if the DWI/ADC is ≤ 3, however it becomes PI-RADS score 3 if the DWI is ≥ 4.
A lesion assessed as category 3 based on T2w images remains PI-RADS score 3 if the DWI is ≤ 4, however, it becomes a PI-RADS score 4 if the DWI/ADC is score 5.
Peripheral zone:

PI-RADS:
Transitional zone - T2W category 1 Transitional zone - T2W category 2 Transitional zone - T2W category 3 Transitional zone - T2W category 4 Transitional zone - T2W category 5
Examples of PI-RADS 1-5:
In the transition zone, the PI-RADS
assessment category of a lesion is determined primarily on T2W-images and then
correlated to DWI/ADC. Examples of PI-RADS categories 1-2 are given in the table.
Click to enlarge the image. In the transition zone an equivocal or indeterminate lesion (category 3) is assigned to PI-RADS category 4 if the DWI corresponds with score 5 (markedly intense greater than 1.5cm). The lesion remains assigned to PI-RADS category 3 if the DWI corresponds to DWI score 4 (markedly intense but less than 1.5cm) or a lower score. Examples of PI-RADS categories 3-5 are given in the table.

Prostate cancer in PZ:
For the peripheral zone the DWI/ADC
is the primary determining sequence to assign the PI-RADS assessment category. First look at the images and describe
what you see. A 16 mm lesion (measurement not
shown) was detected and located dorsally in the peripheral zone of the
mid-portion of the prostate on the right. This lesion was assigned to PI-RADS
category 5, based on marked hypointensity on ADC and marked hyperintensity on
DWI (score 5 - dominant sequence), correlated to markedly hypointensity on T2W
(score 5). The Gleason score was 3+4, which
means intermediate risk of an aggressive cancer. The lesion does not abut the
pseudocapsule and there is no sign of extraprostatic growth. Suspicious lesions in the peripheral zone typically have the following characteristics on
T2W-images: Less suspicious features are the following characteristics on T2W-images: First look at the images and then
continue reading. The findings are: This lesion was assigned to PI-RADS
category 5 with suspicion of extraprostatic extension. The Gleason score was 4+3.
This suspected lesion has significant
diffusion restriction .
The ADC measured 440 mm2/s.
Low ADC values indicate a higher risk
of malignancy. The actual ADC value is inversely
correlated to the likelihood of a clinically significant malignancy.
Values above 900 mm2/s are considered
likely benign and below 750 mm2/s likely malignant.
However quantification results may
vary substantially between scanners and protocols. First look at the images and then continue reading. The findings are: A lesion with PI-RADS assessment category 4 located in the left
peripheral zone in the mid-portion of the prostate.
Focal marked hypointensity on ADC
(yellow arrow) (score 4), corresponding an hypointense area on T2W (score 4).
The Gleason score of this lesion was
3+4. A lesion with PI-RADS assessment category 3 is located in the right
peripheral zone, with mild focal hypointensity on ADC (green arrow) with
isointensity on DWI (score 3). No DCE was performed and no further
discrimination could be determined.
Biopsy did not show any sign of
malignancy.
Transition Zone:

Prostate cancer in TZ:
Suspicious lesions typically have the following characteristics: Images 
There is a lesion in the right anterior part of the transition zone.
It has irregular margins on T2W images (score 4) and is focal markedly hypointense on ADC (680 mm/s) (score 4), not exceeding 15 mm in length.
This lesion corresponds to a PI-RADS category 4.
MR-Ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy resulted in a Gleason 3+4. In the right peripheral zone there is a wedge-shaped slightly hypo-intense area (score 2) without suspicious chracteristics on DWI/ADC (score 2).
It was assigned as PIRADS category 2.This region is benign and has
most likely glandular atrophy or focal inflammatory findings on histopathology. High-grade tumors often reveal a
lower T2W signal intensity than low-grade tumors. Extension into the anterior
fibromuscular stroma or the urethral sphincter can be seen. In general, suspicious lesions in the
transition zone are frequently challenging to distinguish from the surrounding
hyperintense glandular and hypointense stromal tissue. ImagesThere is a lesion located anteriorly in the midline, most likely in the anterior fibromuscular stroma at the junction of the base and the mid-portion of the prostate.
There is no extraprostatic extension.
The lesion has irregular margins on T2W images with an
"erased charcoal" appearance, exceeding 15 mm in maximum length (score
5) and is markedly hypointense on ADC (score 5).
Category: PI-RADS 5.
MR/Ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy resulted in a Gleason
3+4. Images 
27mm lesion anterior in the apex of
the transition zone, with an "erased charcoal" appearance.
This corresponds to an area of
restricted diffusion with a droplet-shape. The lesion was scored a PIRADS category
5.
MR/Ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy
resulted in a Gleason 3+4.
Anterior Fibromuscular Stroma:
The normal AFMS shows bilaterally
symmetric shape (“crescentic”)
and symmetric low signal intensity similar to that of the obturator or pelvic
floor muscles on T2W, ADC, and high b-value DWI without early enhancement. Since prostate cancer does not originate from the
AFMS, when reporting a suspicious lesion in the AFMS, criteria for either the
PZ or TZ should be applied, depending on the zone from which the lesion appears
most likely to be originating. This is an example of an adenocarcinoma involving the AFMS. ImagesT2W: The left anterior TZ zone shows a lenticular
hypointense lesion.
A focal markedly hyperintense region on DWI corresponds to
hypointense focal markedly area on ADC.
DCE: The region of interest shows early
enhancement. PI-RADS score: 4.
Histopathology: Gleason score 4+4 following
MRI fusion-guided targeted biopsy.
TNM-stage:
TNM-staging is based on clinical (c) and pathological (p) findings, and if indicated on additional imaging findings. For T-staging a prostate MRI is advised in: Nowadays there is increased utilization of prostate MRI in the primary diagnostic work-up. The table only shows the stages that are relevant for imaging. The full table is found here Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate
Locally advanced prostate cancer:
The prostate does not have a true capsule. However on MRI the outer border of the prostate does have a thin, hypointense line, which is histopathologically composed of a fibromuscular band. This hypointense line can be used to assess extraprostatic tumor growth. The neurovascular bundles are located at the posterolateral aspect of the prostate (at the 5 and 7 o'clock position, see example on the left). Involvement of the neurovascular bundle should be specifically reported, as nerve-sparing surgery will not be possible. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images of locally advanced prostate cancer. There is a large lobulated tumor originating from the left prostate lobe infiltrating the mesorectum, the rectum as well as the left pelvic wall (i.e. T4). There are large para-iliac and mesorectal lymphnodes distributed mainly on the left side of the pelvis (i.e. at least N1). Left prostate needle biopsies proved localization of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Gleason score 9 (5 +4), volume percentage estimated 90%. The vascular insertion at both the base and apex are susceptible locations for extraprostatic extension.
Seminal vesicle invasion can be observed by direct tumor extension into the vesicles.
Expansion of the vesicles, focal or diffuse low T2W signal intensity, abnormal contrast enhancement or restricted diffusion can also be features of involvement.
In addition, involvement is likely present when the angle between the prostate base and the vesicle is obliterated.
When the external urethra is involved at the apex, surgical excision can cause sphincter malfunction, resulting in incontinence. ImagesThe axial T2W-image at the level of the prostate base demonstrates low signal intensity replacing the normal signal intensity of the left peripheral zone, with direct tumor extension from the base of the prostate into both seminal vesicles (arrow).
Restricted diffusion appears as an area of low signal intensity on the ADC map.
Gleason score: 4+3.
N-stage:
DWI is the best sequence for detection of lymph nodes. T1W series are useful for interpretation of the border contour and signal characteristics of lymph nodes. MR has a low accuracy for distinguishing positive or negative lymph nodes if characterization is based on size alone. The following characteristics are considered suspicious: Regional lymph nodes (green) are below the level of the common iliac junction and are staged N1: Distant lymph nodes (red) are outside these regions and are staged as metastatic disease M1a:
Benign findings:

Benign prostate hyperplasia:
Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) results in the formation of well-circumscribed, encapsulated nodules in the transition zone.
Some of these nodules have dense stroma with low T2W signal intensity and low ADC (yellow arrow). The most important characteristic feature to distinguish BPH nodules from malignancy is the generally well-defined and well-circumscribed morphology interpreted in axial, coronal and sagittal series. The left peripheral zone lesion was classified as PI-RADS 5 (red arrow).
MRI- targeted biopsy revealed a Gleason 3+4. T2 hypointense BPH nodules can be less distinctly circumscribed within the transition zone and may show some degree of restricted diffusion. Also, these nodules tend to enhance early and intensely on DCE, making conclusive characterization difficult. Here a patient with BPH in the transition zone seen as heterogenous stroma with a large cystic area (arrow). Biopsies showed chronic benign prostatitis. Not all nodules exist in the transition zone.
Some can be ectopic and may be found in the peripheral zone (arrow). 
This entity shouldn’t be confused with prostate cancer. BPH consists of a mixture of stromal and glandular hyperplasia and may appear as band-like areas and/or encapsulated round nodules with circumscribed or encapsulated margins. ImageThis coronal T2W
image shows various types of BPH nodules. Predominantly glandular BPH nodules and cystic atrophy exhibit moderate-marked T2 hyperintensity and are distinguished from malignant tumors by their signal and capsule. ImageAxial T2W image shows
a glandular BPH nodule with hyperintensity on T2W image surrounded by a
capsule.
Prostatitis:
Prostatitis or rather inflammation is
a common finding in men and can occur in the absense of any clinical history or
symptoms.
Prostatitis and other benign features
like glandular fibrosis, scarring, atrophy and post-biopsy hemorrhage can mimic
prostate cancer in the peripheral zone, since all present as a focus of low
signal on ADC.
However benign features mostly
presents as a band-like or wedge-shaped or diffuse area of low signal
intensity, while prostate cancer is more round or droplet-shaped. The hypointensity on ADC in inflammatory
prostatic tissue is usually not accompanied by hyperintensity on high b-value
DWI series. Also ADC values in prostate cancer
tend to be lower than ADC levels in prostatitis.
On DCE there is increased
enhancement, which is therefore not helpful in the differentiation.
In case of chronic inflammation,
concordant fibrosis and focal atrophy may be observed, which presents as focal
retraction in the normal anatomic convexity of the peripheral zone. Differences between prostatitis ( images on the left) and prostate cancer (images on the right) Here we see the differences between prostatitis ( images on the left) and prostate cancer (images on the right). Left The images on the left show a wedge-shaped area of mild hypointensity on T2W and ADC with no concordant high signal on DWI located dorsally in the right peripheral zone of the midportion of the prostate (yellow arrow). This was interpreted as focal inflammation (PI-RADS category 2). No biopsy performed. Right The images on the right show a clinically significant prostate cancer with an ill-defined zone of markedly hypointensity on T2W and ADC and focal high signal intensity on DWI dorsally in the left peripheral zone (PI-RADS category 4). MRI-targeted biopsies showed a Gleason score of 4+3. The images show bilateral wedge-shaped, sharply demarcated hypointense lesions in the peripheral zone with minimal low ADC signal. These findings can be regarded as benign characteristics, i.e. inflammation. Biopsies showed focally some inflammation with glandular hyperplasia. The T2W-images show a diffusely
hypointense peripheral zone. The ADC does not show any foci of
significant low signal intensity. The DWI is hyperintense on both
sides. The ADC value was 830 mm2/s. This was interpreted as benign
characteristics (PI-RADS category 2) and diagnosed as chronic inflammation. Biopsies showed focal chronic active prostatitis and no malignancy. A 70-year old patient was referred with a raised PSA of 9ng/ml, a PSA density 0.10.
A PI-RADS score of 5 was
given to a hypointense area in the right peripheral zone at the midgland, with
diffusion restriction (black arrow). The DCE  showed vivid and peripheral enhancement of the lesion (arrowheads). A biopsy was performed and the histopathology results showed abscess formations. Peripheral enhancement and diffusion restriction are typical imaging findings of an abscess. Hemorrhage. The DCE image is prior to contrast enhancement.
Hemorrhage:
Hemorrhage in the peripheral zone and in the seminal vesicles is common after biopsy.
It appears as focal or diffuse hyperintense signal on T1W and iso- or hypointense signal on T2W. 
However, chronic blood products may appear hypointense on all MR sequences. This is a case of a 78-year old patient
with raised PSA that underwent a prostate biopsy the previous year before
undertaking one again. ImagesHypointense lesions are seen on T2W in the anterior TZ zone.
These small lesions have high signal on T1W, indicating blood products. No cancer was found after fusion-guided targeted biopsy.
Hemorrhage findings should always be reported.
Cysts:
A variety of cysts can occur in the prostate and adjacent structures.
As elsewhere in the body, cysts in the prostate may contain “simple” fluid and appear markedly hyperintense on T2W and hypointense on T1W.
However, they can also contain blood products or proteinaceous fluid, which may demonstrate a variety of signal characteristics, including hyperintense signal on T1W. ImagesT2W
image shows a focal region of hyperintensity in the left peripheral zone of the
prostate. 
This area corresponds to a hypointense area in DCE images (images
prior to  enhancement). 
Restricted
diffusion is present. 
This corresponds to a proteinaceous cyst.
Prostate volume and PSA density:
Prostate volume determines the feasibility of external radiation therapy, which can be performed up to a volume of 55cc. Please note that this limit is only valid for conventional extern radiation. For proton radiation this limit don't exist. PSA density-values of ≥ 0,20 contribute towards the suspicion of a clinically significant prostate malignancy. In this case the measurements of the prostate are 36 x 50 x 60mm (AP x LR x CC). This results in a volume of 0,52 x (3,6 x 5,0 x 6,0) = 56,2 cc. The PSA level in this patient was 5. The PSA density is 5 : 56,2 = 0,09. This is a low PSA density and this patient probably has no clinically significant malignancy. Ellipsoid formulation:
Maximum AP and longitudinal diameters on a mid-sagittal T2W image and maximum transverse diameter on an axial T2W image multiplied by 0.52.
MR-protocol:
In PI-RADS v2.1 the recommended sequences and settings are:
Spasmolytic agents:
Spasmolytic agents can be considered prior to examination to reduce movements of the small and large bowel. Air and feces within the rectum can impair diffusion assessment. The images are of a patient who did not receive any preparation prior to the MR-exam. The presence of air and stool in the rectum induces discrete linear artifactual distortion in the region of the prostate, restricting the diagnostic accuracy of both the DWI and ADC series. Here an example of a patient who did receive a minimal preparation enema administered a few hours prior to the exam. This resulted in an evacuated rectum. Although an enema may induce rectal peristalsis, no artifacts were observed in this patient.
T1W:
T1W-images determine the presence of post-biopsy hemorrhage.
This patient had systematic TRUS-guided biopsies 3 weeks earlier ImagesHigh signal
intensity on T1W image in the right peripheral zone, with little signal
reduction on T2W images, and no restricted diffusion on DWI / ADC (yellow
arrow).
Furthermore, a suspicious lesion was
identified right anteriorly in the transition zone with low signal intensity on
T2W and ADC and high signal intensity on DWI (black arrow). This lesion showed a Gleason score
4+3 following MRI-targeted biopsy. A large FOV up to the aortic bifurcation helps to assess extraperitoneal and pelvic lymph node involvement and osseous metastatic disease (arrow in figure).
T2W:
High-resolution T2W FSE sequences are obtained in the axial and sagittal plane. T2W images show anatomical information on normal and abnormal prostatic tissue. Additional 3D T2 acquisitions can be used for reconstruction in all three anatomic planes and potential radiotherapeutic purposes. The video nicely demonstrates the high resolution of the transverse 3D images with coronal and sagittal reconstructions.
DWI:
Diffusion restriction is present when a lesion with high DWI signal corresponds to low signal on the ADC map, which is highly correlated to malignant cells.
The exact ADC value of the lesion is inversely correlated to the likelyhood of a malignant lesion. High b-values are necessary to create a high signal-to-noise ratio. B-value of at least 1400 is recommended.
Notice the difference between the B1000 and B1400 images. A fusion guided biopsy of the lesion anterior in the prostate demonstrated a Gleason 3+4. Modified criteria for a negative score on DCE in PI-RADS v2.1 are in italic. Criteria for a positive score on DCE remain unchanged.
DCE:
The criteria for a negative or positive dynamic contrast enhancement series are shown in the table.
DCE can be of additional value in confirming the suspicious conspicuity of a lesion, but are frequently non-specific as prostate cancer may reveal early and increased enhancement but also normal enhancement compared to normal prostate tissue. 
Lack of enhancement does not exclude malignancy, and increased enhancement can be the result of acute or chronic inflammation. The temporal resolution of ≤15 seconds is advised and 3D T1W GRE is preferred.
Timing of the examination:
Post-biopsy changes, i.e. hemorrhage and inflammation, are usually located in the peripheral zone or the seminal vesicles. These changes may adversely affect the interpretation of multiparametric MRI whereas signal intensities might be altered. As these changes tend to diminish over time, an time interval of at least 6 weeks or longer between biopsy and MRI is recommended in the PIRADS guideline. In current daily practice there is a tendency to perform multiparametric MRI before obtaining biopsies which consequently resolve this issue.

MRI of the Breast:
Publicationdate 2009-05-29 This review is based on a presentation given by Leonard Glassman and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Marieke Hazewinkel. MRI is a powerful tool: it is able to detect cancer not visible on conventional imaging, it can be used as a problem-solving instrument, and it can be applied to screen high-risk patients. Breast MRI is also better at monitoring the response to chemotherapy than other imaging modalities used today. It can change the treatment plan in 15-30% of patients with breast cancer. We will discuss the interpretation of breast MRI by looking at: Specific breast lesions Introduction
Introduction:
Enhancing lesions are divided into three main categories: focus/foci, masses, and areas of non-mass enhancement (1). Just as in mammography and ultrasound, we look at its shape, its margins and its internal characteristics: this includes its T1- and T2-characteristics as well its enhancement pattern.
* Non-masslike enhancement
 are areas of enhancement without a detectable three-dimensional mass. Features of non-mass enhancement include its distribution, its internal enhancement pattern, and whether the enhancement is symmetric or asymmetric.
Focus and foci:
One of the things we run into are 'little bright objects'. These foci are enhancing areas of less than 5mm in diameter and are too small to characterize. They have persistent type 1 curves. These lesions are typically stable on follow-up and are considered to be a part of the normal
background enhancement pattern in the breast.
Masses:
Enhancing mass with an irregular shape, which proved to be an angiosarcoma
Morphology:
Shape A mass can be round, oval, lobulated, or irregular. Lobulated masses have undulating contours. Irregular masses have an uneven shape that cannot be characterized as round, oval, or lobulated. If a mass is irregularly shaped, it has a 32% chance of being malignant. The image on the left shows a large, irregular mass, which proved to be an angiosarcoma. The image on the far left is a juvenile fibroadenoma - it is oval in shape and has smooth margins, i.e. typically benign. The non-enhancing septations are not seen in this case. The image on the right is another example of a fibroadenoma: a lobulated mass with non-enhancing septations. Epidermal inclusion cyst with smooth margins Margin Margins can be described as smooth, irregular, or spiculated . Spiculated margins are frequently a feature of malignant breast lesions and radial
scars. If a mass has spiculated margins, it has an 80% chance of being malignant. On the left is an image showing a large, round mass with smooth margins, which turned out to be an epidermal inclusion cyst. Invasive ductal carcinoma with spiculated margins The image on the far left shows a spiculated mass, i.e. 80% chance of being malignant. . Next to it the corresponding gross pathologic specimen. You can see the spiculations invading the surrounding tissue in both. Just like on mammography, this lesion is has a high likelihood of malignancy and would be labelled BIRADS 5. The image on the far left shows an irregularly shaped mass with irregular margins, which was an invasive ductal carcinoma. The image on the right shows a similarly irregularly shaped and irregularly marginated lesion, this time an adenoid cystic carcinoma. LEFT: Fibroadenoma with non-enhancing septations. RIGHT: Invasive carcinoma with enhancing septations The image on the left is a classic benign fibroadenoma. It is a lobulated mass with non-enhancing septations. On this image the margins are a bit irregular here and there, which may be a reason to biopsy this lesion anyway. The image on the right is a classic carcinoma. It is an irregularly shaped mass with irregular margins and enhancing internal septations (the enhancement is not well seen on this image). Fat-containing hamartoma with central high signal on T1WI (arrow)
T1-T2 characteristics:
High signal on T1 The pre-contrast T1, non fat-suppressed sequence can show the presence of fat in a lesion. Central high signal on a T1-weighted image can be seen in intramammary lymph nodes or fat necrosis. Fat is also seen in hamartomas. The image on the left shows an example of a fat-containing hamartoma in the breast. Breast lesions containing fat are benign unless they are rapidly growing. Rapidly growing lesions should be biopsied. High signal on T2-fatsat In T2 fat-suppressed images we are looking for water. Lesions that are bright on T2 include cysts, lymph nodes and fat necrosis. These are all benign lesions. Unfortunately there is one malignant lesion that has a high signal intensity on T2 fat-suppressed weighted images. This is the colloid carcinoma. It is the exception to the rule that all things with bright signal on T2 fat-suppressed images are benign. On the image on the left there are multiple rounded areas in both breasts. These are multiple cysts. Fibroadenoma (left) and a colloid carcinoma (right). Both are bright on T2WI. The image on the far left shows a round lesion with bright signal on T2. This is a a fibroadenoma. On the right is an example of a colloid carcinoma in a breast with dense, glandular tissue. It is the exception to the rule that all things with bright signal on T2 fat-suppressed images are benign. Moderate and low signal on T2-fatsat The T2 fat-suppressed sequences are for detecting lesions with high signal, not moderate or low signal. Moderate and low signal intensities can be caused by cancer.
Enhancement pattern of a mass:
Mass enhancement occurs in six main patterns: Homogeneous enhancement The image on the left shows a homogeneously enhancing lesion. This proved to be an invasive ductal carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma with heterogenous enhancement Heterogenous enhancement On the left, the image shows an irregularly shaped mass with spiculations and a heterogeneous internal enhancement pattern, which proved to be an invasive lobular carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma with rim enhancement Rim enhancement The image on the left shows rim enhancement of a lesion invading the surrounding tissue in a case of invasive ductal carcinoma. Type 1 curve with slow rise and a continued rise with tim
Temporal Resolution - Kinetic Analysis (Curves):
First we look at the initial upslope of the curve during the first one to two minutes. This is either slow, medium or rapid. Then there is the delayed portion - two minutes or more after the injection of contrast. This part of the curve shows either an increase, plateau or washout. The kinetic analysis takes about six minutes of repetitive scanning in total and can lead to three types of curve. Type 1 On the image on the left is a type 1 curve. There is a slow rise and a continued rise with time. A lesion with a type 1 curve has a chance of 6% of being malignant. Type 3 curve with rapid initial rise, followed by washout in the delayed phase Type 3 The type 3 curve shows a rapid initial rise, followed by a drop-off with time (washout) in the delayed phase. A lesion with this type of curve is malignant in 29-77%. This is the red on the CAD (Computer Aided Detection). Type 2 Then there is the type 2 curve, which is in the middle: a slow or rapid initial rise
followed by a plateau in the delayed phase, which is allowed a variance of 10% up or down. The chance of a lesion with a type 2 curve being malignant lies somewhere between
the 6% of the type 1 curve and the 29-77% of the type 3 curve. Many physicians will biopsy lesions with type 2 curves. For non-mass enhancement, kinetics are not very useful. If there is clumped enhancement in a breast it must be biopsied, even though there are no areas with a type 3 curve. CAD with a large area of type 3 enhancement
CAD:
Computer Aided Detection is a purely kinetic evaluation. It does not evaluate the anatomy or pathology of the images. CAD looks at the curves and peak enhancements for the contrast (automated kinetics). It also has some very nice features, including motion registration during subtraction, which can correct for a patient's movement during the exam - something not all MRI scanners can do. It can do multiplanar reconstruction and subtraction very well and very quickly – it also has a good measurement package. The CAD shows a large area of red superimposed on the breast lesion in the image on the left. In CAD, red is bad: it means type 3 washout, and probably cancer. The images on the left show a large, abnormally enhancing area in the left breast. The CAD has detected some very small areas with type 3 washout (in red). When you look at CAD images, take note of the worst (red) areas. This was a large invasive ductal carcinoma.
Non-mass enhancement:

Distribution:
Non-mass enhancement is enhancement without three-dimensional characteristics. It is important because it occurs in a significant number of cancers. You need to look at its distribution, its enhancement pattern and its symmetry or asymmetry. The table on the left summarizes the terms used to describe the distribution of non-mass enhancement in the breast. Focal refers to non-mass enhancement in less than 25% of a quadrant of the breast. Ductal involvement is enhancement in a ductal distribution, and is cancer in 60% of cases. Linear enhancement is similar to ductal enhancement, but does not have a ductal orientation. This finding means cancer in 31% of cases. Segmental enhancement refers to multiple ducts and has a 78% chance of being cancer. Regional enhancement is not ductal or segmental but larger than focal and is cancer in 21%. Diffuse non-mass enhancement is typically benign. Focal DCIS The image on the left shows focal non-mass enhancement. This proved to be a focal DCIS. The image on the left shows linear non-mass enhancement. This proved to be stromal fibrosis. The image on the left shows a mass as well as areas of linear non-mass enhancement. This proved to be linear DCIS with an invasive ductal carcinoma. LEFT: segmental DCIS RIGHT: regional DCIS On the left examples of segmental and regional non-mass enhancement in DCIS. The image on the far left shows a mass with associated ductal enhancement coming from the mass,
which corresponds to anterior and posterior expansion of the tumor in this case of DCIS. The image next to it shows an example of linear non-mass enhancement in a different orientation to that of the ducts in stromal fibrosis. LEFT: Heterogeneous enhancement in invasive ductal carcinomaRIGHT: Punctate enhancement in a hamartoma with fibrocystic change (arrows)
Internal Enhancement Pattern - Nonmass:
Non-mass enhancement can be termed homogeneous and heterogeneous, just as mass enhancement can. As mentioned earlier, punctate enhancement is usually benign, but it can occur focally. In that case there is a 25% chance of cancer. Clumped enhancement is the most important non-mass enhancing pattern to recognize. It has a 60% chance of cancer (typically DCIS). For non-mass enhancement, kinetics are not very useful. If there is clumped enhancement in a breast it must be biopsied, even if there are no areas with a type 3 curve. On the far left heterogeneous enhancement in an invasive ductal carcinoma. The image next to it shows punctate enhancement in a hamartoma with fibrocystic change (arrows). Clumped enhancement in DCIS Clumped enhancement Clumped enhancement is the most important non-mass enhancing pattern to recognize. It has a 60% chance of cancer (typically DCIS). On the left two examples of clumped enhancement in DCIS.
Associated findings:
Carcinoma with extensive thickening of the skin Associated findings can be: The image on the left shows a relatively small carcinoma in the right breast, with extensive thickening of the skin. Inflammatory carcinoma with thickening of the skin The image on the left shows a large inflammatory carcinoma with diffuse thickening of the skin. Enhancing large lymph node (arrow) in a patient with breast cancer The image on the left shows a large enhancing lymph node on the right.
Specific breast tumors:

Cysts:
Cysts have a high signal on T2 fat-suppressed images. After the injection of gadolinium, they will show up as filling defects, sometimes with rim enhancement. Classic fibroadenoma
Fibroadenoma:
Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast lesions after cysts.
In order to be certain a lesion is a fibroadenoma, certain criteria must be met: A fibroadenoma must have benign spatial characteristics. This means it can not have a spiculated or microlobulated border. On the left an example of a classic fibroadenoma: a round, smoothly marginated lesion
with some black or gray areas on the inside, which are the non-enhancing septations. This lesion has a type 1 curve. Fibroadenoma with nonenhancing septations On the far left is another example of a fibroadenoma with clear non-enhancing septations.
These septations are also visible on the gross pathology. Two examples of a hamartoma with dark areas of fat on a fat suppressed T1WI with Gd.
Fat containing lesions:
The pre-contrast T1, non fat-suppressed sequence can show the presence of fat in a lesion. High signal on a T1-weighted image can be seen in intramammary lymph nodes, fat necrosis and hamartomas. These areas will be dark on fat suppressed images. On the left two classic examples of hamartomas. These lesions have fat-containing areas which are suppressed on these images after the administration of intravenous gadolinium.
DCIS:
Kinetics are usually not useful in DCIS, especially not in cases when low-grade. Many cases of DCIS show no washout and usually there is slow initial enhancement. The distribution of the enhancement however is important. DCIS typically shows clumped, ductal, linear or segmental non-mass enhancement. On the left a patient with areas of non-mass enhancement in both breasts (DCIS). There is a small enhancing mass medially in the left breast, which was a small invasive carcinoma. DCIS and IDC The image on the left shows an enhancing mass in the left breast. This proved to be an invasive carcinoma. Lateral to it is an area of ductal non-mass enhancement, which proved to be DCIS. DCIS bilaterally On the left another case with diffuse, bilateral DCIS. DCIS bilaterally Another case of DCIS, located laterally in both breasts. The cases on the left are more difficult to diagnose . Both of these patients had large homogeneously enhancing areas in the right breast. In both patients this proved to be DCIS. Two cases of intraductal carcinomas
Invasive ductal carcinoma:
Most invasive carcinoma are ductal, some are lobular, and there is a group of rarer types. Regardless of the type of cancer, they typically appear on breast MRI as an irregularly shaped,
spiculated mass with rim- or heterogeneous enhancement after the administration of intravenous gadolinium. On the left two cases. The image on the far left is an invasive ductal carcinoma presenting as a large, heterogeneously enhancing mass. Next to it an example of an invasive ductal carcinoma presenting as a smaller mass with rim-enhancement. Two cases of intraductal carcinomas The image on the far left shows an irregular mass with some ductal extension, and
on the right an irregular mass extending to the chest wall, but not invading it. There is no chest wall enhancement. Two cases of invasive lobular carcinoma
Invasive lobular carcinoma:
Invasive lobular carcinoma is one of the types of cancer that does not always
show a lot of enhancement on breast MRI, which can make it difficult to diagnose. In these two cases however, this was not a problem. The image on the far left is of a diffuse invasive lobular carcinoma. On the right is a MIP showing a large area of abnormal enhancement, which proved to be a diffuse invasive lobular carcinoma. Colloid carcinoma
Colloid carcinoma:
The image on the left is a T2WI with fat suppression. It is a colloid carcinoma in a breast with dense, glandular tissue. It is the exception to the rule that all things with bright signal on T2 fat-suppressed images are benign. Terminal duct carcinoma
Others:
Terminal duct carcinoma On the left a large, irregular, enhancing mass in a male patient. This was a terminal duct carcinoma. Terminal duct carcinoma Sarcoma with osseous differentiation Sarcoma with osseous differentiation The case on the left is a patient with a sarcoma with osseous differentiation, showing less enhancement. Adenoid cystic carcinoma Adenoid cystic carcinoma On the left an image of an irregular enhancing mass which was an adenoid cystic carcinoma. Metaplastic carcinoma Metaplastic carcinoma On the left an example of a metaplastic carcinoma with rim-enhancement.
This is not necessarily a typical presentation.

Answers to ankle and foot cases
Foot:

case 1 - distortion:
The findings are: A vertical fracture of the medial malleolus is a push-off fracture. According to Lauge-Hansen the fracture results from an adduction force on the supinated foot. 
The lateral side is under extreme tension with stretch on the lateral collateral band. In stage 1 there is either a rupture of the lateral collateral band or an avulsion fracture (which we also know as Weber A). In stage 2 there is always a vertical fracture of the medial malleolus and there has to be either an avulsion of the lateral malleolus or a rupture of the collateral band as these sequences always are in this order with first stage 1 and then stage 2. This means, that whether we see a fracture on the lateral side or not, it doesn't matter.
There must be an injury to both the medial aswell as the lateral side and we now know that the ankle is unstable, because the ring of stability is broken in two places. Here another unstable ankle fracture. According to Lauge-Hansen this is SA stage 2.
According to Weber this is Weber A with additional fracture to the medial malleolus. Go back to the cases...
case 2 - chronic pain post ankle sprains:
The findings are: The calcaneus and navicular bone do not normally articulate. 
With osseous coalition, a bony bar that bridges the two bones is seen. Compare to the normal situation. With fibrous or cartilaginous coalition, the bones are in close proximity, both have irregular surfaces, and the anteromedial calcaneus is abnormally widened or flattened. 
On lateral radiographs, elongation of the anterior dorsal calcaneus may simulate an anteater’s nose. 
Hypoplasia of the talus is sometimes observed in calcaneonavicular coalition. On the CT we see a coalition between the calcaneus and the os naviculare. The CT shows sclerosis and subchondral cysts as a sign of ‘friction’ due to the neoarticulation. The MRI shows bone marrow edema as a sign of a symptomatic coalition. Go back to the cases...
case 3 - distortion:
This is another case of a fracture of the posterior malleolus. Again we have to look at the algoritm for ankle fractures... A fracture of the posterior malleolus is seen in a Weber B or a Weber C fracture. In this case we have already seen an oblique fracture of the lateral malleolus, which means that we are dealing with a Weber b fracture.
Now we only need to determine which stage it is.
The most common stage 2 is stable, but stage 3 and 4 are unstable. In this case we already in stage 3 and we wanna look for signs of stage 4.
A painful soft tissue swelling at examination would already indicate stage 4, but in this case there is more. Maybe you want to go back to the radiograph before you continue reading... In this case we are looking for a stage 4. Now you notice the soft tissue swelling on the medial side (arrow).
The most important finding however is the irregularity and radiolucency of the upper part of the medial malleolus.
If you use your imagination, you can identify a fracure line here, which you would not have seen if you did not use the algoritm. Go back to the cases...
case 4 - distortion:
The only thing that we notice is soft tissue swelling especially on the medial side. Continue with the ankle injury algoritm... Injury to the medial collateral bands can be seen in Weber B fracture stage 4.
However there are no signs of a WeberB fracture. The other possibility is that there is a Weber C fracture with a high fibula fracture, that is not visible on the x-rays of the ankle.
The medial band rupture is stage 1 and the injury may stop there or continue to stage 2,3 or even 4.
We need additional x-rays of the entire lower leg to find out which stage we are dealing with. Continue with the x-rays of the lower leg... A high fibula fracture is seen (Maisonneuve).
Usually the patient will only feel pain at the level of the ankle since ligament ruptures are very painful and not notice the fibula fracture. Go back to the cases...
case 5 - chronic pain:
The findings are: The subtalar joint consists of the anterior, middle, and posterior facets. Talocalcaneal fusion most commonly involves the middle facet at the level of the sustentaculum tali. Talocalcaneal coalitions may be difficult to visualize on the standard radiographic views of the foot because of the complex orientation of the subtalar joint. A number of secondary radiographic signs of talocalcaneal coalition have been described, including: A talar beak occurs because of impaired subtalar joint motion, which results in the navicular overriding the talus. Periosteal elevation occurs at the insertion of the talonavicular ligament, and, ultimately, a cycle of osseous repair results in formation of the talar beak. The “C sign,” is a C-shaped line on the lateral view, that outlines the medial talar dome and posteroinferior sustentaculum. The C sign results from bone bridging between the talar dome and sustentaculum, as well as the prominent inferior outline of the sustentaculum.
As the x-ray beam strikes the posteroinferior outline of the abnormal sustentaculum tangentially over a long distance, an uninterrupted “C” results. The C sign may be observed in both osseous and nonosseous coalitions. ImagesOn the T1W-image there is a bony coalition and ankylosis of the talus with the calcaneus. Go back to the cases...
Ankle:

case 2 - distortion:
In this case the most obvious finding is a fracture of the posterior malleolus.
This should urge you to look for other findings, since an isolated fracture of the posterior malleolus is extremely uncommon and probably does not exists. You need to look at the algoritm for ankle fractures.. Algoritm for ankle fractures In the algoritm a fracture of the posterior malleolus is either: This means that we have to look for other signs.
Since there is no sign of a Weber B fracture, this must be a Weber C fracture. Are there any other signs that are in favor of a Weber C fracure? Yes there is.
Now we recognize the soft tissue swelling on the medial side and a small avulsion, which is stage 1 of this injury. We now can predict a high fibula fracture, which was confirmed by a radiograph of the whole lower leg. Go back to the cases...
case 5 - distortion:
There is a subtle fracture visible on the Morrison's and the lateral view.
This is a large tertius fracture. 
There is no sign of a Weber B type of fibula fracture. The combination of this fracture and the soft tissue swelling on the medial side indicate that we are dealing with a Weber C type of injury (or pronation exorotation injury according to Lauge-Hansen). The medial collateral band injury is stage 1 and the tertius fracture is stage 4.
This means that this is an unstable fracture.
There must be a high fibula fracture. Go back to the cases...

Incidentalomas in the liver:

What to do with incidentally found lesions in the liver?:
Maarten van Leeuwen, Joost Nederend and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the University Medical Centre of Utrecht, the Leiden University and the Rijnland hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2007-05-12 This review is based on a presentation given by Maarten van Leeuwen for the Dutch Radiology Society and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Joost Nederend and Robin Smithuis. With the increasing use of multidetector CT small hepatic lesions are frequently depicted. In many cases the pathological nature of these incidentally found liver lesions or incidentalomas is not known. This results in a diagnostic problem, which is initiated by radiology so radiologists should take responsibility in correctly categorizing these lesions as to their clinical significance. In this article we will discuss the management of two different type of incidentally found liver lesions: Hypervascular lesions. TSTC (too small to characterize lesions)
TSTC (too small to characterize lesions):
Contrast enhanced CT (portal phase) showing multiple small hypodense lesions. First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. We see multiple hypodense lesions. We cannot diagnose them with certainty as: For this type of lesions which, due to their small size and atypical imaging features, cannot be confidently categorized, the term TSTC (to small to characterize) lesions has been coined.
TSTCs in patients without a known malignancy:
Jones (1992) studied 1500 patients who had an abdominal CT examination (1). He found:
TSTCs in patients with a primary malignancy:
Schwartz (1999) studied 2978 patient with a known malignancy (2). He found TSTCs in 12% of patients with a known malignancy. In 88% of patients the lesions were benign and in 12% they proved to be metastases (1.4% of all patients). The percentage of malignancy depended much on the known primary tumor. Most metastases were found in patients with breast cancer. This is in accordance with the observation that breast metastases usually present as multiple small lesions, while liver metastases of colorectal cancer and lymphoma usually present as a solitary or a few larger masses. Probability of a lesion being benign using size and edge as characterization Robinson (2003) studied various characteristics of TSTCs and their correlation with malignancy (3). The lesions where classified by their behavior on follow up CT, as either stable or unstable. Image features of stable (benign) lesions where small size and sharp edge. Heterogeneity and soft tissue attenuation were associated with unstable behavior, but only seen in a small minority of cases.
TSTCs in breastcarcinoma:
Krakora (2004) studied the prognostic importance of small hypoattenuating hepatic lesions seen at initial CT in patients with breast cancer, who did not have definite hepatic metastases at initial examination (4). One or more small hypoattenuating hepatic lesions (TSTCs ) were seen in 54 of 153 patients (35%). During a median follow-up of 584 days definite hepatic metastases developed in 43 of 153 patients (28%). No difference was found in the chance for development of liver metastases in patients with or without TSTCs at initial CT. Krakora concluded that in patients with breast cancer, who do not have definite hepatic metastases at presentation, there is no evidence that small hypoattenuating hepatic lesions seen at initial CT contribute to an increased risk of subsequently developing hepatic metastases.
Conclusion:
In a patient without a known malignancy these small hypodense lesions, as a rule, should be considered as benign. In a patient with a known malignancy a single TSTC lesion can also be assumed to be benign. Even multiple TSTCs in these patients are mostly benign, especially when they are small, sharply defined and hypodens. In these latter cases you should not be too defensive! Don't dictate 'we can't rule out metastases'. In patients with breastcancer and no known livermetastases at presentation, these TSTC lesions have no positive predictive value for the development of livermetastases in the long term.
Incidental hypervascular lesions:
Incidental hypervascular lesions are also very common findings in liver imaging. It is important to differentiate between 'touch' and 'don't touch' lesions. Benign 'don't touch' hypervascular tumors include hemangioma, FNH and small adenomas. 'Touch' lesions include large adenomas (more then 5 cm) and malignant tumors like Hepatocelular carcinoma (HCC), Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLHCC) and metastases. These enhancing, solid lesions should be differentiated from vascular lesions
, like hepatic aneurysm,
aortaportal shunt or pseudoaneurysm.
Incidence of hypervascular lesions:
Karhunen (1986) found at autopsy an incidence of 20 % hemangioma, 3% FNH and 1% adenoma (5). A study in 1989 by the AFIP showed a FNH : adenoma ratio of 8:1 in a series of 9000 autopsies (6). Typical hemangioma with nodular peripheral enhancement. Enhancement in Hemangioma A hemangioma is a slowly perfused vascular space. So the timing and amount of enhancement will
follow, but lag behind the arterial system. Hemangiomas less than 1 cm frequently demonstrate
immediate homogenous enhancement, isodense to the aorta. Hemangiomas larger than 1cm generally show slow
centripetal spread of nodular enhancement, slowly decreasing in density. On the left a typical hemangioma. Enhancement in arterial phase is almost isodense to the aorta, and, as contrast diffuses toward the center of the lesion, the level of enhancement lowers slowly, and in the late phase is still hyperdense compared to the vascular spaces. 'Capillary blush' in FNH. Notice early enhancement, but not as bright as in hemangioma. In venous and delayed phase the enhancement is almost isodense to the liver. Enhancement in 'capillary blush' The typical, slowly perfused vascular space enhancement of a hemangioma has
to be differentiated from the 'capillary blush' due to an abundant capillary network
which characterizes FNH, adenoma, HCC and
hypervascular metastases. As capillaries are surrounded by tissue the overall enhancement will be less
dense compared to the
enhancement of the vascular spaces in
hemangioma. Hence, in capillary blush, the enhancement occurs slightly later compared to the aorta and is less dense than the aorta. Typical hemangioma on dynamic MR
Hemangioma:
Hemangiomas on dynamic MR will show the same
enhancement characteristics as on contrast-enhanced CT. The advantage of MR over CT is its higher sensitivity to contrast as will be shown in the next case. Aspecific hypovascular lesion on CT On the left an atypical, apparently hypovascular lesion on CT, possibly metastasis. MR depicts enhancement better than CT Same case on dynamic MR. Notice how MR depicts the nodular, peripheral, slowly progressing enhancement (blue curved arrow) which CT failed to depict. Small hemangioma atypical on US, showing typical enhancement of small hemangioma on CT. On the left an atypical hypoechoic lesion, surrounded by a small but definite halo. In the arterial phase there is homogeneous
enhancement of arterial intensity, frequently seen in small hemangiomas. In the portal venous phase and in the equilibrium phase it has the same enhancement as the aorta. So all appearances are consistent with a hemangioma, a benign, non-solid
vascular lesion. Once we have excluded hemangiomas, our
main goal is to determine whether a hypervascular lesion is a
FNH, which is the most prevalent hypervascular
solid lesion, or whether it is a lesion
which needs further management like adenoma,
HCC, FLHCC or hypervascular metastases. For this purpose we have to look for morphologic features
like inhomogeneity and presence of capsule, scar,
calcification or fat. Two FNHs with late enhancing central scar
Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH):
On the left two adjacent hypervascular lesions with
homogeneous enhancement in arterial phase and hypodense
central scars in arterial and venous phase, which
enhance in the equilibrium phase. This is characteristic of FNH. Notice that the small FNH, which is
anterior and right to the bigger one, has the same enhancement pattern. FNH is considered a non-neoplastic, hyperplastic
response to a congenital vascular malformation. Histologically, FNH is not a tumor and
consists of benign-appearing hepatocytes
occurring in a liver that is otherwise normal (i.e. no
cirrhosis). At late arterial phase, FNH typically presents
with a bright homogeneous enhancement, but less intense than the aorta with
a hypodense central scar. Smaller (
The radiating hypodense fibrous bands or
septa, arising from the scar, are not infrequent and
quite characteristic. At portal phase, FNH is often iso-attenuating
to the normal liver and may be difficult to
deliniate. Delayed phase often shows hyperattenuation of
the central scar and septa due to late
opacification of the fibrotic components. No calcifications, inhomogeneity or capsule should be seen
in FNH. Typical FNH on MR Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (2) On the left a typical FNH on MR. Slightly hypointense on T1WI and slightly
hyperintense on T2WI. The scar is somewhat hyperintense
on T2. The enhancement is as we
expect with 'capillary blush' with a scar that
enhances late in the equilibrium phase. Atypical FNH with non-enhancing central scar Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (3) On the left a lesion, that has all the
characteristics of FNH except for lack of late
enhancement of the central scar. In addition, it is slightly hypodense to normal parenchyma in
the portal and equilibrium phase. However, all other characteristics are present
like lobular enhancement, central scar and no
capsule, and therefore we characterize this lesion as FNH. Hemangioma and FNH on ultrasound and dynamic MR. Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (4) The ultrasound image on the left shows two lesions. The small one (blue arrow) is characteristic of a
hemangioma, while the larger one (green arrow) is non
specific on US. On T2WI the hemangioma shows the typical
homogeneous hyperintensity . The larger lesion is somewhat hypointense on T1 and somewhat hyperintense on T2. The enhancement is almost homogeneous with
small septae that do not enhance in the arterial
phase and do show late enhancement (yellow arrows). On T2WI the hemangioma shows the typical
homogeneous hyperintensity . The larger lesion is somewhat hypointense on T1 and somewhat hyperintense on T2. The enhancement is almost homogeneous with
small septae that do not enhance in the arterial
phase, and do show late enhancement (yellow arrows). We also characterize this lesion as FNH. Small FNH Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (5) On the left another FNH on MR. The lesion is almost isointense to liver on T1WI and T2WI, but shows more contrast to the liver on a T1W-MPRGRE (gradient-echo). The enhancement in the arterial phase is lobulated with nonenhancing septation and in the equilibrium phase the lesion is not different from normal liver parenchyma. Notice that the lesion has a small scar. Small FNHs often do not have a central scar on imaging and even not on pathologic examination. Incidental hypervascular lesion on a CTA for pulmonary emboli Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (6) Another FNH on the left, in order to get really familiar with these common lesions. On a CTA for pulmonary emboli a small hypervascular lesion is seen in the liver. Further evaluation was done with MR. On T1WI the lesion is not seen and on T2WI it is only slightly hyperintense. In the arterial phase there is homogeneous enhancement and in the venous phase the lesion is not seen. Provided that this patient does not have liver cirrhosis, this is probably a benign lesion, probably FNH. As the appearance was not pathognomonic for FNH, a follow up examination was done and the lesion had not changed, making the
diagnosis FNH most likely. When does it stop, this comfortable feeling, that something is a FNH? It stops when there are too many features that do not belong to a FNH. Like the case on the left. Decide for yourself which findings are compatible with the diagnosis typical FNH and which are not. The lesion on the left does have a central scar
like FNH , but on the T1WI the lesion is inhomogeneous and not sharply defined. On T2WI the scar has a low signal intensity. For typical FNH the signal intensity however should be high and the lesion is again
inhomogeneous. In the arterial phase the lesion does enhance
like FNH, but in the portal and equilibrium
phase the enhancement persists and is inhomogeneous. In addition, the central scar does not enhance in the
late phase. So there are many findings that are not
compatible with the diagnosis FNH. Since the specificity for diagnosing a lesion as
benign should be very high, we cannot stop
here and we have to get a histological diagnosis.
Fibrolamellar HCC:
When we encounter lobulated hypervascular masses in the liver, an important diagnosis that you don't want to miss is a fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC). This particular form of HCC may mimick FNH on imaging. In contrast to HCC, the prognosis is reasonable. Like FNH, FLHCC also is a hypervascular, lobulated mass with a central scar
. Both FNH and FLHCC appear in normal liver, unlike
HCC that is most frequently seen in a cirrhotic liver. In distinction to FNH, FLHCC is inhomogeneous,
large (> 5 cm), frequently has calcifications (>70%), a
blunt central scar and usually there is
lymphadenopathy. Calcifications in FNH are so uncommon that it
should make you consider another diagnosis like
FLHCC. Pathologic specimen of FLHCC and FNH (Courtesy Dr. Baron) Fibrolamellar HCC (2) On the left a pathologic specimen of FLHCC and FNH. At first glance they look very similar. However when you look carefully you will notice the more lamellar and heterogeneous structure of FLHCC compared to the homogeneous appearance of FNH. Left-lobe fibrolamellar HCC. Courtesy Dr. Federle and Dr. Ichikawa (3) Fibrolamellar HCC (3) On the left CT- and MR-images of a left-lobe fibrolamellar HCC in a 19-year-old man. A. Non-enhanced transverse CT scan shows calcification (curved arrow) within the hypoattenuating tumor (straight arrows). B. Hepatic arterial contrast-enhanced transverse CT scan shows heterogeneous hypervascularity within the tumor (arrows). C. Ten-minute delayed transverse CT scan demonstrates subtle areas of hyperattenuation that represent fibrous tissue within the central scar, radiating septa, and capsule (open arrows). 
Curved arrow = calcification. D. Transverse T2-weighted MR image (5,000/105) also demonstrates the central scar and septa (open arrow). The tumor itself (straight arrows) is nearly isointense to liver (the only such case in our series). Left-lobe fibrolamellar HCC. Courtesy Dr. Federle and Dr. Ichikawa (3) On the left a photograph of the cut surface of the gross pathologic specimen shows a large tumor with eccentric and central scars (open arrows) and radiating septa. The mass has an irregular lobulated pushing margin (solid arrows) and a variegated appearance with areas of bile staining. In a series of 31 cases of FLHCC, Ichikawa et al (7) found the following: Adenomas in arterial, portal venous and equilibrium phase
Adenoma:
An adenoma is regularly characterized by bleeding, fat or peliosis. Although we cannot see peliosis itself, it can result in a hyperintense lesion on T1WI. On the left two incidentalomas. Decide for yourself why these are not FNH lesions. In the arterial phase there are two
hypervascular lesions, somewhat less
dense than we would expect in FNH. Both lesions demonstrate a halo of a capsule,
which should not be apparent in FNH. Unlike in FNH, the enhancement is
inhomogeneous and in the portovenous and
equilibrium phase the lesions are not isodens to
the liver. Adenoma with hemorrhage Adenoma (2) Regularly adenomas present with bleeding. On the left images of a woman who presented with acute abdominal pain. On US a livermass was seen and free fluid surrounding the liver. This is a typical presentation of an adenoma. On portal phase CT, the lesion is hypointense with haemorrhage adjacent to the lesion, extending subcapsularly. Adenoma: non-specific features on CT Adenoma (3) On the left an US image of an incidentally found lesion in a 50 y old female. Work up was done with CT, but only non-specific features were found without signs of hypervascularity. . Continue with next images. Adenoma: capillary blush in arterial phase and signal loss in out of phase image indicating the presence of fat. In contrast to the CT, there clearly is
enhancement in the arterial phase on MR, again demonstrating that MR
depicts enhancement better than CT. The enhancement is due to a capillary blush, most intense in the arterial phase with apparent wash-out in portal and equilibrium phase, due to greater enhancement of the surrounding parenchyma. In the 'out of phase' image there is signal loss
indicating that the lesion contains fat,
which is very suggestive for adenoma. A HCC may also contain fat, but in this case
there is no cirrhosis and the entire
lesion shows signal loss,
which we would not expect in HCC. HCC: hypervascular lesion in a cirrhotic liver
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):
Concerning the diagnosis of HCC, there is
one thing to remember: 'Every hypervascular lesion in a cirrhotic liver is
HCC until proven otherwise'
'. On the left we see a cirrhotic liver with irregular
margins (arrows), suggesting that the hypervascular lesion is a HCC. The inhomogeneous
enhancement and the partial capsule are helpful
for the diagnosis HCC, but even if these
features were not present, our diagnosis still
would be HCC. Hypervascular metastases with typical peripheral enhancement
Hypervascular metastases:
Characteristics of hypervascular metastases are: On the left hypervascular metastases. Notice that the larger ones show central necrosis, as they outgrow their blood supply.
Differential diagnosis of Hypervascular lesions:

Work up:
In the workup of incidentally found
hypervascular lesions, we first have to decide
whether the lesion is a hemangioma, because
these are the most common lesions and usually have
specific imaging findings. If not, we have to find out whether it is an FNH. For this differentiation we have to look at
differences in enhancement pattern and
differences in morphology like presence of a
capsule, scar, calcification and inhomogeneity. Hypervascular lesions most often can be characterized, even when small. FNH and hemangiomas need no further investigation or treatment. The preferred modality to characterize incidentalomas is MR, as it is better for lesion characterization and incidentalomas often occur in young females, where radiation burden should be minimized. If HCC or FLHCC is considered further investigation is always needed.

CT and MRI of the Eye:
by David Youssem
Neuroradiology department of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore:
Publicationdate 2008-09-19 This review is based on a presentation given by David Yousem and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. David Yousem is currently the Director of Neuroradiology and Professor of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is also the editor of the book 'Neuroradiology: the Requisites'. In this article a systematic approach to orbital pathology is presented based on division of the orbit into the following compartments: Extraconal space Anatomic Considerations
Anatomic Considerations:
The first thing you do when you see a lesion in the orbit, is to decide whether it is an ocular lesion or a non-ocular lesion, i.e. is it involving the globe or involving the structures outside the globe. If it is a non-ocular lesion, the next question is whether the lesion is located within the intraconal space, i.e. within the space bounded by the cone formed by the extraocular muscles, or whether it is located within the conal or extraconal space? Once you have decided where the lesion is located, consider the differential diagnostic possibilities using the mnemonic VITAMIN C and D. We will first describe the anatomic spaces of the orbit and summarize the pathology within these spaces, even if some of these pathologies are not visible radiologically. Then we will discuss the radiological findings in certain orbital diseases. Ocular space The eye has the following well defined anatomic spaces: Anterior chamber When we move from anterior to posterior the first area is the anterior chamber. It is bounded by the cornea anteriorly and the lens and iris posteriorly. Specific pathologies within the anterior chamber are: Posterior chamber This is a very small area posterior to the iris, which we cannot discern on imaging. Specific pathologies in this area are: glaucoma, uveitis and ciliary melanoma. Vitreous body The larger area posterior to the lens is the vitreous body. Specific pathologies within the vitreous body are: The vitreous body is surrounded by the membranes of the retina, the choroid and the sclera. Retina pathology: Choroid pathology: Sclera pathology: The intraconal space is marked by arrows and is located within the muscle cone It contains the optic nerve, vessels and cranial nerves III, IV and VI. Intraconal space The ocular muscles within the orbit form a muscle-cone. These ocular muscles are connected via the annulus of Zin, which is a fibrous connective tissue sheet and together they form the conal space. It separates the intraconal from the extraconal space. Intra-orbital pathology which is non-ocular is either in the intraconal, conal or extraconal space. Intraconal space pathology: Conal space The conal space is formed by the ocular muscles and an envelope of fascia. Conal space pathology: Extraconal space The extraconal space is the area outside the muscle cone. Extraconal space pathology: Orbital appendages The lacrimal gland is located superolaterally in the orbit. Diseases of the lacrimal gland can be divided into granulomatous, glandular and developmental (see Table). Secretions go medially across the globe and are collected in the punctum and then go into the lacrimal sac. From the lacrimal sac secretions travel inferiorly to the nasal lacrimal duct, which drains under the inferior terminate into the nose. In children congenital obstructions of the valves in the lacrimal duct can lead to cystic areas medially in the orbit also known as dacryocystoceles. In adults obstruction is more often due to strictures from ethmoid sinusitis or stones blocking the nasolacrimal duct. This will result in epiphera or increased tearing. Drainage can be improved with balloon dilatation.
Ocular pathology:
Retinoblastoma: axial FLAIR (left) and coronal enhanced T1WI (right)
Calcifications:
In adults the most common intraorbital calcifications occur at the tendinous insertion of the ocular muscles. Other common calcifications are at the optic nerve head within the eye, also called 'optic disc drusen'. These are usually asymptomatic, but when the ophtomologist inspects the eye, there is the impression of papilledema, i.e. pseudo-papilledema. In children  calcifications in the globe means retinoblastoma until proven otherwise even if it is bilateral. On the left an image of an adolescent with bilateral retinoblastoma.
Retinoblastoma:
As you can see in the table on the left, retinoblastoma is a one of the more common tumor in the first year of life. The other tumors in this age group are neuroblastoma, Wilm's tumor, leukemia and teratoma. All bilateral cases are hereditary and result from a deficient tumor suppression gene on chromosome 13. The diseases that are listed in the differential diagnosis are all uncommon. Bilateral retinoblastoma On the left images are of a 13 month old female with bilateral lesions as a result of bilateral retinoblastoma. Small retinoblastomas are treated with different kinds of therapy (cryoablation, laser photocoagulation, chemothermotherapy, brachytherapy, plaque radiotherapy) in order to save the eye and avoid enucleation. If the patent is treated with radiation, there is a 30% chance of a second malignancy within the radiation field, due to the radiation but also due to the deficient tumor suppression gene. Outside the radiation field there is an 8% chance of malignancy. In order of frequency: Osteosarcoma > other sarcoma > melanoma > carcinoma. Retinoblastoma with calcification These patients are also at risk for pineal tumors and parasellar PNETs. The pineal gland is considered as the third eye and the third testicle. Meaning, you can develop retinoblastoma in the pineal gland, i.e. trilateral retinoblastoma, but also germinoma. Always examine the brain in these patients and remember that at the age of 0-4 years, which is the peak age for retinoblastoma, the pineal gland does not calcify, so any calcification in this region is suspicious of retinoblastoma. On the left images are of another patient with retinoblastoma. This tumor presents as a large calcification. When a retinoblastoma occupies more than half of the globe, as in this case, the eye has to be enucleated. Leukocoria Usually, when a light shines through the iris, the retina appears red to the observer. In leukocoria (white pupil) the retina abnormally appears white. Retinablastoma is usually detected through leukocoria as it occurs in two third of patients with retinoblastoma. These children are usually too young to present with visual complaints. There are many causes of leukocoria as listed in the table on the left. Melanoma
Melanoma:
On the left images of an adult with an ocular mass. The most common intraocular lesion in an adult is melanoma (as in this case).
Number two is metastases and others like hemangioma, leiomyoma and osteoma are uncommon. Persistent hyperplastic primary vitrous
Persistent hyperplastic primary vitrous (PHPV):
On the left another cause of leukocoria. This is persistent hyperplastic primary vitrous (PHPV). There is a persistent hyaloid canal when the hyaloid artery does not integrate. On the images we see a persistent canal that goes from the optic nerve to the lens. There is also retinal detachment (occurs in 30-55%) and notice the microphtalmia. PHPV is the second most common cause of leukocoria. These patients also develop glaucoma and cataract.
Coats' disease:
Coats' disease is a rare eye disorder of unknown cause, leading to full or partial blindness, characterized by abnormal development of blood vessels behind the retina. Traumatic cataract
Globe rupture:
On the left images of a patient who presented in the ER with post-traumatic orbital swelling. This patient has globe rupture and specifically rupture of the anterior chamber. As radiologists we are used to looking at the vitreous body if we think of globe rupture, but that is not enough. Notice that the depth of the anterior chamber is decreased. There is increased density anteriorly as a result of hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber). Also notice that the lens on the right side is blurred and slightly less dense. This is called a traumatic cataract. Maybe you would have expected the lens to be more dense, but that is usually not the case. Globe rupture On the left CT images of a patient who had a left eye trauma. Study the images for 5 findings and then continue reading. The findings are : Globe rupture is seen most commonly at the anterior chamber. The termination of the retina is called the ora serrata (arrows)
Retinal and choroidal detachment:
Blood can be located in the following locations: Retinal detachment can be distinguished from choroidal detachment, because the retinal epithelium ends at the ora serrata (figure). Evidently a retinal detachment will not go beneath this point. Retinal detachment with haemorrhage is seen mostly in adults with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. In young infants it can be seen as part of a shaken baby syndrome. In choroidal detachment recent intraocular surgery is the most common association followed by trauma. Retinal detachment On the far left a CT of a choroidal detachment going beyond ten and two o'clock (with the lens at twlve o'clock) and evidently more anteriorly to the ora serrata. It looks as if the detachment ends at the optic nerve but, if you look carefully, the choroidal detachment actually crosses the optic nerve. That would be very unusual for a retinal detachment, but is sometimes seen in choroidal detachment. On the right a T1WI of a retinal detachment. It ends at the optic nerve and at the ora serrata. Choroidal detachment On the left an image of another case of choroidal detachment. Bilateral colobomas
Coloboma:
Coloboma is a congenital malformation in which part of the eye does not form due to failure of fusion of an embryonic structure called the intraocular fissure. Often there is microphtalmia and the eye protrudes inferiorly. In 10% there are other CNS anomalies. On the left images of a patient with bilateral colobomas. Colobomas Coloboma can be part of the CHARGE syndrome: Coloboma can also be part of the COACH syndrome: On the left images of a patient with a small coloboma at the entrance of the optic nerve. Agenesis of the corpus callosum with lipoma The patient on the left had a coloboma and also agenesis of the corpus callosum with an associated midline lipoma.
Intraconal pathology:
Neuromyelitis optica
Devic's syndrome:
Devic's syndrome is also known neuromyelitis optica. Let's first look at the images and then discuss it in more detail. On the left image there is a normal optic nerve on the right side. Notice that the optic nerve is white matter tract. It has the same signal intensity as the white matter in the brain. On the contralateral side there is high signal intensity in the optic nerve. This is therefore extra-ocular intraconal disease and we will be thinking of neoplastic versus demyelinating diseases. Continue with the next image. Neuromyelitis optica On the left a FLAIR image with fat-sat. Notice the abnormal signal intensity and the fact that the optic nerve is not enlarged, which argues against the possibility of a tumor. Devic's syndrome Images of the cervical spinal cord show a long segment of non-space occupying disease. Based on these images the differential diagnosis is MS and Devic's syndrome (also caled neuromyelitis optica). Since MS is far more common, this would be the most likely diagnosis, but this happened to be Devic's syndrome. Some consider Devic's syndrome as a form of MS, but Devic's syndrome differs from MS: Multiple sclerosis
MS:
On the left images of a different patient, who also has optic neuritis. There is high signal in the optic nerve and in the brain there are multiple lesions as a result of MS. These lesions did not occur at the same time, so there is dissemination in time and in place, which is specific for MS. Meningioma
Meningioma:
On the left images of another patient with extra-ocular intraconal disease. First look at the images, describe them and come up with a differential diagnosis (for a moment disregard the fact that the title of this paragraph is meningioma). The optic nerves are normal, but there is abnormal mass-like enhancement of the optic nerve sheath on the left. So this is probably a neoplasm and of the neoplasms meningioma is by far the most common optic nerve sheath tumor. Meningiomas present with visual disturbances early in the course of the disease as a result of ischemic neuropathy due to venous obstruction. Clinically this presents as a pale disk. Abnormal enhancement of the optic nerve sheath On the left a table with the differential diagnosis of abnormal enhancement of the optic nerve sheath, also called 
optic nerve tram track sign. Meningioma of nerve sheath is a result of subdural growth leading to progressive visual loss, papilledema, optic atrophy. There is a strong association with NF-2. The pale disk is due to venous outflow impairment. Calcifications are seen in 20-50%. Seeding into the subarachnoid space is another cause of abnormal ennhancement of the optic sheath due to the fact, that the sheet of the optic nerve communicates with the intracranial compartment of the subarachnoid space). Optic glioma. CT and MR T1WI
Optic nerve glioma:
First look at the images on the left. Which side is abnormal and what is the most likely diagnosis? There is sphenoid wing hypoplasia on the right and on the left the optic nerve near the chiasma is enlarged (visible on the MR). So the diagnosis is neurofibromatosis type I with sphenoid wing hypoplasia and an optic pathway glioma. Optic glioma in NF1 The term optic nerve glioma is a misnomer. Actually the tumor can present anywhere along the optic tract from the occipital region to the chiasm and the optic nerve. The term glioma is also rather non-specific. These tumors are juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas WHO type 1, which is the most benign form of astrocytoma. They make up 4% of all orbital tumors. More than 50% of patients who have an optic nerve glioma have NF1, but in NF1 only about 10% have optic nerve glioma. They are less commonly cystic in NF than in non-NF. The mean age at diagnosis is 4-5 years and only 20% of these patients have visual symptoms, because the glioma does not affect the optic nerve early and because these small children do not complain of vision problems. On the left another case with a more typical example of optic nerve glioma also in a patient with NF1. LEFT: multiple iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules) RIGHT: axillary freckling (small brown spots) and caf? au lait spots The criteria for the diagnosis of NF1 are met in an individual if 2 or more of the following signs are found:
Conal pathology:
Thyroid eye disease
Thyroid eye disease:
Take a look at the images on the left, describe them and come up with a differential diagnosis and again disregard the title of this paragraph. The diagnosis is thyroid eye disease and the differential diagnosis is pseudotumor of the orbit. In a moment we will discuss how to differentiate these two diseases. In the past the term Grave's ophtalmopathy was used. This however suggested that the patient is hyperthyroid. Nowadays we know that patients that are treated for Graves disease can be euthyroid or even hypothyroid and still develop thyroid eye disease and therefore nowadays we use the term thyroid eye disease. The great danger of thyroid eye disease is compressive optic neuropathy either due to direct compression by the muscles or ischemic by compression of the vessels. The key feature to look for is the orbital apex. If you do not see any fat around the orbital apex, there is a great chance of compression. These patients are treated with decompression through an endoscopic procedure in which the medial wall of the orbit i.e. the lamina papyracea is crushed. Pseudotumor of the orbit
Pseudotumor:
Take a look at the images on the left. This is a case of pseudotumor. Pseudotumor is idiopathic inflammation of the orbit. It can affect every part of the orbit: muscles, tendons, fat, optic nerve, nerve sheet, lacrimal gland etc. Thyroid eye disease versus pseudotumor The key distinction between pseudotumor and thyroid eye disease is the fact that in pseudotumor not only the muscles, but also the tendons are involved. These patients feel pain when they are moving their eyes as the tendons get irritated. On the image on the far left notice the tapering of the swollen muscle at the point of the tendinous insertion in a patient with thyroid eye disease. Next to it the images of the patient with pseudotumor. Notice that the swelling includes to the tendinus insertion.
Extraconal pathology:
Periorbital abscess
Periorbital abscess:
On the left nonenhanced CT-images of a patient with a evident periosteal or periorbital abscess as a result of a complicated ethmoid sinusitis. The teaching point to make is the following:
Do not wait for peripheral enhancement to call it an abscess! In every other location you wait for nice rim enhancement to call it an abscess and if not you say it is a phlegmone. The treatment is the treatment of the sinusitis. Periorbital abscess Here MR-images of an eleven year old boy, who experienced some irritation of his right eye the night before and woke up with a proptosis. The enhanced T1W-images with fatsat nicely demonstrate a periorbital abscess which causes the proptosis. Notice the ethmoid sinusitis. The other teaching point to make is the following:
In children be very careful about extension outside the sinuses! Any change outside the sinus should be called an abscess. In children the periorbita is far more fenestrated and disease will easily spread. So be aggressive in calling small abnormalities an abscess. Periorbital abscess can lead to venous thrombosis of the superior and inferior ophtalmic vein. In certain fungal sinusitis (e.g.aspergillosis) you can even get cavernous sinus thrombosis and cavernous-carotid fistula Orbital cellulitis
Orbital and periorbital cellulitis:
On the left images of a patient who presented in the ER with a 'red hot eye' and proptosis. Now the difference between orbital and periorbital cellulitis is an important one and is based on an anatomic structure, which is called the orbital septum. If a patient comes in the ER with a red hot eye and the inflammation includes the orbital septum and everything superficial to it, the diagnosis is periorbital cellulitis and the patient is treated with oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis. In the case on the left however the structures posterior to the septum are also involved. This patient has an orbital cellulitis and will have to stay in the hospital to receive antibiotics intravenously. Fibrous dysplasia of the sphenoid wing
Sphenoid wing lesions:
On the left a CT image of a patient with proptosis due to a sphenoid wing lesion. There are four sphenoid wing lesions that can cause proptosis: Meningioma with hyperostosis of sphenoid wing and proptosis These images are of a patient who had a slowly progressive proptosis. On the T2W-image the hyperostosis of the right sphenoid wing is seen, which corresponds to the CT-image. Notice the small extra-axial lesion (arrow). This is a meningioma. On the coronal T1W-image post Gadolineum you can see the enhancement of the meningioma. When a menigioma grows like this along the neurocranium, it is also called a meningioma en plaque.
Lacrimal gland lesions:
Lacrimal gland lesions are listed in the table on the left.
Inflammatory conditions are by far the most common lesions of the lacrimal gland (i.e. Sj?gren's, TB, fungus, pseudotumor).
These conditions do not cause masses. The most common mass of the lacrimal gland is lymphoma followed by pleomorphic adenoma.
Epithelial tumors including adenoid cystic tumors are uncommon.
Vascular Malformations:
Vascular malformations can be intraconal, extraconal or multicompartment and that is the reason why they are not discussed in the categories above. Before we show you some cases, we have to discuss the 
Mulliken and Glowacki system for the categorization of vascular anomalies in the head neck region, which is widely accepted now. Capillary hemangioma
Capillary hemangioma:
The first lesion in the Mulliken & Glowacki system is the capillary hemangioma. Capillary hemangiomas have the following characteristics: Venous vascular malformation
Venous Vascular Malformation:
The second lesion in the Mulliken & Glowacki system is the venous vascular malformation. On the left an image of a venous vascular malformation. There is a lesion in the intraconal compartment with a phlebolith. Most are unilocular, but this one is multilocular. Venous vascular malformations have the following characteristics: Lymphatic malformation with fluid-fluid levels locaed both in the intraconal and in the extraconal compartment.
Lymphatic malformations:
The next entity is the lymphatic or veno-lymphatic malformation. These are little cystic areas, that often bleed after minor trauma. They may have high signal intensity on T1WI due to high protein or hemorrhage. they usually do not enhance unless there is a venous component, that may show enhancement. This lesion is in the 'family' of cystic hygroma. More characteristics are: Varix visible during valsalva at the moment of sneezing.
Orbital varix:
On the left images of a patient with an orbital varix, who had noticed that during straining there was a propulsion of the left eye .
The upper image is during rest and the lower image is during valsalva at the moment of sneezing.
During valsalva the varix shows extreme dilation (red arrow).
Notice that during valsalva also on the normal side the superior ophthalmic vein dilates (blue arrow).

Enhancement Patterns in CNS disease:
Linda Jacobi-Postma and Debbie Duyndam
Maastricht University Medical Center and Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis in the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 15-08-2023 Under normal conditions there will be no enhancement of
the brain parenchyma in the central nervous system, because the brain is the only organ with a barrier for proteins, inflammatory cells and also for contrast medium.
This barrier is called the Blood-Brain Barrier. The Blood-Brain Barrier can be damaged by various diseases like: Understanding the patterns of enhancement in CNS disease will improve image assessment and differential diagnosis.
In this article eleven patterns will be discussed with many examples. We want to honour James Smirniotopoulos, who teached us thinking in patterns, not just enhancement. 
His article in 2007 in Radiographics and his animated lectures inspired us writing this article.
He was so kind to review this article.
Introduction:

Pattern approach:
In this table the most common patterns of enhancement in CNS diseases are illustrated.
The first three are extra-axial (diffuse and focal dural and leptomeningeal), while the others are all intra-axial patterns. You can click on the links below to go directly to examples of a specific pattern.
Normal enhancement:
Structures in the brain, that do not have a blood-brain barrier or structures that are extra-axial will show normal enhancement. These structures are the dura, the pineal gland (1), vessels (2), the pituitary stalk (3) and pituitary gland (4), the choroid plexus (5) and the area postrema (arrow). The area postrema is a highly vascular paired structure in the medulla oblongata in the brainstem and is located just inferoposterior of the floor of the fourth ventricule.
Diffuse Dural pattern:
The diffuse dural pattern of enhancement is a common finding in MR examinations.
It is most commonly seen in post-surgery and intracranial hypotension. Normal dural enhancement The dura mater is an extra-axial structure and therefore does
not have a blood-brain barrier. In half of the population enhancement can be seen on a
contrast-enhanced MRI as a thin, smooth and discontinuous layer as seen in
these images.
Intracranial hypotension:
Intracranial hypotension is a condition in which there
is abnormally low pressure or volume within the skull due to a reduction in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
The classical presentation is a persistent orthostatic
headache. Intracranial hypotension can be caused by surgery, lumbar puncture, ventricular drains and “spontaneous”
CSF leakage. Spontaneous CSF leakage is seen in an
anterior dural tear (type 1), a leaking nerve root diverticulum (type 2) or a
CSF-venous fistula (type 3). Further
work-up to find the cause for CSF leakage requires spinal imaging, either with
MRI of CT-myelography.
The CSF leakage can be treated by placing an epidural bloodpatch. MRI findings include small
ventricles, subdural hygromas and
eventually hematomas, diffuse (supra-and
infratentorial) smooth dural enhancement,
sagging of the midbrain and acquired tonsillar ectopia, pituitary engorgement and distention of
the dural venous sinuses. When the CSF pressure drops, the volume of the veins in the subarachnoid space increases, ultimately leading to vasocongestion and interstitial edema in the dura.
Imaging findings can be normal in 10% of cases. These images are of a 58 year-old male who presented with headache in the sitting and
standing position. Images
A
smooth dural enhancement is present in both the supratentorial and the infratentorial compartment. 
Notice the small ventricles. Continue with the sagittal images... Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Image 1The findings are rather subtle, but there is: Conclusion: findings
typical for intracranial hypotension. Image 2
After therapy, which was a non-targeted epidural bloodpatch, the brain and brainstem have returned to their normal position with normalization of the cisterns and fourth ventricle configurations. These images are of a  44-year old male, who presents with longstanding headache, which increases with forward bending. Images
T2W-image demonstrates small bilateral subdural hygromas (arrowheads).
After gadolinium there is
smooth dural enhancement. Continue with the sagittal images... Images
There is engorgement of the venous structures, as is depicted in the superior sagittal sinus (arrow heads), the straight sinus and confluens.
There is downward placement of the brainstem with shortening of the pontomammilary distance, flattening of the pons and kinking of the brainstem at the craniocervical junction.
The venous plexus in the cervical anterior epidural space is widened. ConclusionThese findings are typical for intracranial hypotension.
The patient was later diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder. These images are of a male with a history of left-sided middle cerebral artery
infarction, who presented with headache, worsening on standing and forward bending
and tinnitus. Images
There is thick and somewhat irregularenhancement of the dura, with thicker apposition
over the tentorium, left temporal and left
frontoparietal dura. ConclusionIdiopathic
hypertrophic pachymeningitis.
This turned out to be a biopsy proven IgG4-related disease. Continue with the post-treatment images... After treatment with corticosteroids there is resolvement of the dural thickening and enhancement.
IgG4-related pachymeningitis:
It has now become clear that many of the cases, that we used to call idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis are actually IgG4-related. IgG4-related disease is an auto-immune disease that can affect many organs of which the pancreas is the most common.
In the brain the meninges can be involved.
It is important to suggest this diagnosis as it is a treatable disease. This is a companion
case of a patient with headache and bilateral hearing
loss. Images
There
is thickening of the dura with enhancement with a slight irregular aspect. 
there is no
engorgment of the veins
The enhancement extends into
the internal acoustic meatus (yellow arrowhead). Continue with the images post-treatment... Same patient before and 6 months after steroid
therapy with resolution of the abnormalities . This patient had a craniectomy for surgical evacuation of a left-sided subdural
hematoma. Images
A thin linear enhancement of the left parietal dura is shown,
demonstrating postsurgical dural enhancement.
(PS you might also call a focal dural pattern).
Focal Dural pattern:
The most common tumor that presents with a focal dural pattern is a meningioma, which is an extra-axial lesion. Lymphoproliferative disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled production of lymphocytes, including lymphomas, lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, LIP and many others.
Lymphomas that present as a dural tumor are secondary CNS lymphomas, i.e. the lymphoma starts elsewhere in the body and spreads to the brain. Most intra-axial CNS lymphomas however are primary. 
They start in the brain and are not located in other organs.
Meningioma:
Which findings are typical for the diagnosis meningioma? Findings: The illustration shows favorite locations of meningiomas: at
the skull base, the falx, tentorium and convexity. Most meningiomas are WHO grade 1. An atypical meningioma is grade 2 and an anaplastic
meningioma is grade 3. The meningo-endothelial cells arise from the arachnoid cap cells, which
is the inner most layer of the dura. On CT a meningioma is relatively hyperdense and may contain
calcium. 
When they contain calcium, they usually grow very slowly. On MRI a meningioma is iso-intense to the grey matter on T1-
and T2W-images. There is vivid enhancement due to the fact that the
extra-axial dural capillairies do not have a blood-brain barrier. A dural tail is a common finding. It is caused by vasocongestion and interstitial edema of the
nearby dura and mostly not caused by tumorcells. The images show a more aggressive looking lesion with edema
and midline shift. Which findings favor the diagnosis of a
meningioma? Findings: The intraparenchymal
extension suggests a higher grade meningioma, while the presence of
edema is not a reliable sign of a higher grade. The following signs are described in meningiomas: The
sunburst sign can give the appearance of a flower like in this anterior skull base
meningioma’s These
images are of a 56-year old woman with breast cancer.
She had a skull lesion at a bone scan nine years earlier
which was thought to be a metastasis. Now she presented with vomiting and headache. Images 
There is a a large extra-axial lesion compatible with a  meningioma.
There is profound hyperostosis of the skull and invasion of the superior sagittal sinus.
This is not a bone metastasis because of these findings and the fact that the lesion is present for nine years.
Metastases:
First look at the images and then continue reading. Question: The findings are: In 25-45% of the cases metastases can be solitary. Metastases in the watershed area (black arrow) and at the gray/white matter interface (white arrowheads) Here another patient with metastases. Again notice the location in the watershed area (black arrow) and at the gray/white matter interface (white arrowheads)
Lymphoma:
These images are of a 76-year old woman, who was confused after a fall.
First look at the images and then continue reading. Question: The findings are: All these findings are typical for a primary CNS lymphoma, which is different from a systemic lymphoma.
These tumors make up for 6-7% of all CNS tumors and the histology is a B-cel NHL.
They are mostly located periventricular subependymal, in the corpus callosum and in the basal ganglia.
Always think lymphoma in a solid enhancing lesion which is located near the ventricles. The
hyperdense appearance on CT and the slight hypointensity on T2W-imaging,
as well as the restricted diffusion are attributed to the dense cellularity of
the lymphomatous tissue. In immuno-compromised patients the enhancement can be ring-like.
This patient has a lot of edema, but in many cases the edema is very limited. This is a 81-year old man with Waldenstrom disease. A rare manifestation of Waldenstrom is CNS infiltration
by lymphoplasmocytoid cells. This is called Bing-Neel syndrome. Notice in this patient multiple solid enhancing lesions, which are all located in the periventricular area. Septic emboli
Leptomeningeal:
The leptomeningeal enhancement follows along the pial surface of the brain and
fills the subarachnoid spaces of the sulci and cisterns. The most common cause is infectious meningitis followed by
meningeal carcinomatosis. This
patient presented with headache. Images Images
Sagittal images demonstrate a small osseous defect at the posterior border of the frontal sinus with a small frontal cerebral encephalocele (black arrowhead).
There is leptomeningeal enhancement (arrow). Conclusion
The
presence of a frontal encephocele lead to opacification of the frontal sinus and meningitis due to direct communication
via the osseous defect. Leptomeningitis
represents inflammation of the subarachnoid space. MRI demonstrates FLAIR
hyperintensity in the CSF space, especially in the sulci, and leptomeningeal
enhancement. Possible complications of leptomeningitis are subdural empyema,
secondary communicating hydrocephalus, infarction and ventriculitis. Diffusion
restriction can be seen in the ventricles, sulci and VR spaces. these images are of a 2 year old child, who presented with fever, abducens
paresis and eventually loss of consciousness. Images
There is obliteration of the prepontine cistern on FLAIR with
restrictive diffusion. 
There is hyperintense signal on DWI in the
bilateral ventricles, consistent with pus. 
High-resolution T2W-images demonstrate loss of hyperintense signal in the cisterns and subarachnoid space, based on thick
pus. Final diagnosis
Haemophilus influenzae type B meningitis and ventriculitis. These images are of a 55-year old immunocompromised patient, who presented with
cognitive complaints and headache. Images
FLAIR shows non-supressed enhancing CSF in the subarachnoid
space.
Look along the cerebellar foliae, these are hyperintense on FLAIR (black arrowheads).
There is faint leptomeningeal enhancement (yellow arrowhead). 
Furthermore there is high FLAIR signal at the
perivascular spaces in the semioval centre with enhancement. ConclusionThis turned
out to be cryptococcal meningitis.
The spread
along the perivascular spaces in an immunocompromised patient is suggestive.
Sometimes in these patients there are also pseudocysts. Basal meningitis
Neurosarcoidosis:
These images are of a 31-year old male, who presented with
headache and hemihypesthesia. Images
FLAIR demonstrates high signal at the basal  structures, with enhancement at and around
the basal cisterns and vallecular cisterns.
These findings are compatible with the diagnosis of basal meningitis. Meningitis at the base of the brain is usually caused by sarcoid, tuberculosis, syphilis, or any other low-grade chronic granulomatous process.
For this reason a chest CT was performed. Continue with the CT-images... The chest CT shows the typical findings of sarcoid.
There are small nodules along the fissures in a perilymphatic distribution and enlarged hilar nodes. Sarcoid
can have different neurological and radiological presentations. 
The cranial nerve symptoms are the result of basal meningitis. In most cases there are also abnormal chest findings. This patient has mutiple leptomeningeal nodules
They have high signal post contrast and relatively low signal on T2-weighted images, compatible with granulomatous
nodules. This proved to be neurosarcoidosis. ‘Trident’ sign in a patient with spinal neurosarcoidosis Classical spinal neurosarcoidosis may present with the ‘trident’ sign, where there is
enhancement of the leptomeninges and peripheral white matter (*) and central canal of the spinal cord. In this patient there was also enhancement of the trigeminal nucleus (black arrowhead), the dura and both optic nerves.
The enhancement around the left optic nerve is best seen on the axial image (yellow arrowhead), while the enhancement on the right is best seen on the coronal image (white circle). Tuberculous meningitis In this companion case there is high
signal intensity along the basal cisterns on FLAIR-images and leptomeningeal
enhancement along the ambiens cistern and tegmentum.
Note the small enhancing foci in the right hippocampus and left occipital lobe. This
turned out to be a tuberculous meningitis. “Sugarcoating” leptomeningeal enhancement in medulloblastoma.
Meningeal carcinomatosis:
These images are of a 9-year old boy who is known with a posterior fossa medulloblastoma. Images
The medulloblastoma presents as a large enhancing mass (arrow). 
There are many small enhancing foci as sign of leptomeningeal metastases.
At follow-up after surgery and
radiotherapy there is irregular and nodular leptomeningeal enhancement. 
This
“sugarcoating” enhancement is well demonstrated at the pons and the lining of
the vallecular cisterns. Depiction
of leptomeningeal foci and enhancement can be improved by using contrast-enhanced
FLAIR. 
As with meningitis also look at the subarachnoid space at non-contrast FLAIR.
Normally on these images the CSF is suppressed, but in case of pathology the CSF appears more
hyperintense. 
A helpful clue for metastasis as differential for meningitis is
the appearance of thick nodular enhancement and the presence of intracerebral
and dural metastases. 
Always check the cranial nerves for enhancement.
The clinical signs and history of the patient can be a helpful clue. This is a patient with lungcancer which was complicated by carcinomatous meningitis. Can you tell which cranial nerves are involved? Now on these images it is very difficult to see, but if you were able to scroll through the enhanced MRI, you would notice that the following cranial nerves show pathologic enhancement: Also note the pontine metastasis. Carcinomatous meningitis in a patient with lungcancer and cerebral metastases. These
examples show the advantage of FLAIR+Gd over T1W+Gd in a patient with lung cancer with cerebral metastases and carcinomatous
meningitis. ImagesThe FLAIR-image better shows the leptomeningeal enhancement around the pons (yellow arrow) and in the cerebellar foliae (black arrowheads).
Gyral pattern:
The gyral pattern of enhancement is enhancement of the
cortex, most frequently seen in ischemia as a result of reperfusion during the healing
phase in subacute and acute ischemia This can be caused by
luxury perfusion and/or cortical laminar necrosis. Another cause of gyral enhancement is the vasodilatation
phase of migraine headache and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome
(PRES). SMART is Stroke-Like Migraine Attacks After Radiation Therapy, which is an uncommon delayed complication of
cerebral radiotherapy.
Subacute infarction:
These images are of a 86-year old man who has a wobbling walk since a couple of weeks. Study the images and then continue reading.
What are typical findings in this case? Typical findings: This type of gyral enhancement is the result of luxury perfusion with a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier and some neovascularization. Continue with more images of this patient.. Question: what is the hyperintensity on the non-contrast T1W-image? Images
The FLAIR shows an infarction with cytotoxic edema and
swelling of the gyri. The hyperintensity on the non-contrast T1W-image is called laminar necrosis and although first described
as anoxic encephalopathy, it represents cytotoxic oedema with degradation of
proteins within the metabolic active cortex.
It is a poor prognostic
indicator. In this table the findings in luxury perfusion and laminar necrosis are summarized. In patients who are treated with intra-arterial thrombectomy, the gyral enhancement can start earlier. Gyral enhancement in a woman with breast cancer Sometimes it can be difficult.
This patient had a history of breast cancer.
An MRI was done because she had some neurological failure. On the FLAIR image there is a tiny hyperintense spot (white arrow).
Now this could have been diagnosed as a possible metastasis, but on the T1W-image with Gd there is definitely linear gyral enhancement.
This makes a small subcortical infarction the most likely diagnosis.
A follow up scan (not shown) was performed and definitely excluded the possibility of a metastasis. Multiple infarctions in a patient with COVID This is a patient with COVID infection, which was complicated by clotting problems and this resulted in multiple infarctions. Notice the gyral pattern of the enhancement. Continue with more images of this patient... Again notice the gyral enhancement on the T1W+Gd images as a result of luxury perfusion and notice the widespread diffusion restriction on the DWI-images. Can you tell which vascular areas are involved? These areas are called the watershed or border zone areas. 
A border zone area receives a dual blood supply from the most distal branches of two large arteries.
In times of systemic hypoperfusion, such as in disseminated intravascular coagulation or heart failure, these regions are particularly vulnerable to ischemia because they are supplied by the most distal branches of their arteries, and thus the least likely to receive sufficient blood.
SMART:
These images are of a 59-year old man, who had a partial resection of a glioma in 2008.
In 2016 there was progression of the tumor which was treated with radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy.
In 2021 there was no sign of residual tumor and in 2022 this patient presented with migraine. Images In 2008 a tumor is seen as a lesion with high signal on T2W
at the right basal ganglia and insular region. In 2021 everything is stable, but in 2022 there is gyral
enhancement of the grey matter of the temporal lobe (arrowheads). Continue with two more images of this patient... Stroke-like Migraine Attacks after Radiation Therapy Images
DWI shows cortical diffusion restriction in the right temporal lobe.
The sagittal T1W+Gd-image at a different level again shows the gyral enhancement pattern. This is called SMART  (Stroke-like Migraine Attacks after Radiation Therapy).
It is an uncommon delayed complication of cerebral radiation therapy characterized by cortical swelling and gyral enhancement. These patients usually present with migraine, but seizure and hemiparesis is also a possible presentation.
In the context of prior brain radiotherapy this should raise the suspicion of SMART syndrome. 
Prompt diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary invasive investigations.
It is a self limiting disease. It is a diagnosis per exclusionem and you have to rule out ischemia, PRES and seizures. Herpes encephalitis
Herpes encephalitis:
A 13-year old girl was admitted to the hospital with acute headache and confusion. Images
FLAIR images show widespread hyperintense areas in both temporal lobes and insula.
This is more pronounced on the right side where the T1W+Gd
shows gyral enhancement of the insular cortex. This is a typical case of Herpes encephalitis. Continue with more images of this patient... Notice how subtle the abnormalities are on the NECT compard to the findings on MR. The right temporal lobe is more hypodense compared to the
left with some compression of the right temporal horn (white arrow). 
Note also
the small hypodensity at the insular ribbon (black arrow). CT is less sensitive than MRI and can detect abnormalities
only in half to two-thirds of the patients. 
It may take 3-4 days to manifest
the changes in the temporal or frontal lobes. 
Hypodensities, hemorrhage and
edema are often noted, while contrast enhancement may take almost a week. The DWI
shows diffusion restriction on both sides.
MRI
is more sensitive and subtle abnormalities as diffusion restriction can be
present at an early stage.
In case of suspicion a lumbar puncture is warranted
and prompt treatment should be started. Herpes encephalitis
Herpes encephalitis is a reactivation of the HSV-1 virus which is located in the trigeminal ganglion.
Herpes encephalitis has a bimodal spread.
It is seen in young children and in patients over fifty. Limbic encephalitis
Limbic encephalitis can present with similar imaging findings, but usually has a more indolente course, whereas herpes encephalitis
presents more acutely. It is a paraneoplastic or auto-immune disease where neuronal antibodies attack the cells in the limbic system. 
Antibodies can sometimes be found in the CSF, but a normal CSF and brain imaging does not exclude the diagnosis.
Patients are treated with immune therapy.
Vascular / Perivascular:
Perivascular enhancement is a linear type of enhancement
along the smaller vessels and in the perivascular space. On axial images this type of enhancement can present as small
dots (see figure) or stripes in the distribution of the perivascular spaces. The differential diagnosis of perivascular enhancement
contains many rare diseases, which makes it difficult.
PML-IRIS:
PML-IRIS is a paradoxical deterioration of the patient
following abrupt improvement of the patients immune function. The improvement of the immune system results in an activation
of the inflammatory response to a JC virus infection. It is seen in HIV patients following initiation of
antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The same mechanism with development of PML-IRIS, that we see in
these HIV patients, can be seen in MS patients who are treated with Natalizumab. These images are of a HIV-patient who had started HAART therapy 2 weeks earlier and presented with behaviour disturbances. Images
On the T2W-image there is hyperintensity of the right frontal white
matter. 
Notice the punctate enhancement on the axial images, which is actually
linear on coronal or sagittal images (not shown). This is a perivascular pattern and combined with the history
the diagnosis is PML-IRIS. PML-IRIS in a patient with HIV Here another patient with HIV, who had started HAART two
months ago. The CD4-count is good. However, there is a progressive paresis and the patient is experiencing
more seizures. 
Large bilateral white matter lesions are shown with punctuate
enhancement on the post-contrast T1W-Image. The diagnosis PML-IRIS was made and the patient was treated
with steroids.
CLIPPERS:
CLIPPERS is a Chronic Lymfocytic Inflammation with Pontine Perivascular Enhancement Responsive to Steroids. It can be difficult to differentiate this lymphocytic inflammation from lymphoma and that is why some cases that were first diagnosed as CLIPPERS turned out to be lymphoma. These images are of a 62-year old man who presented with loss
of function of the oculomotor nerve on the left side. Images
FLAIR images show widespread hyperintensity in the pons and
mesencephalon. 
There is punctate and linear enhancement.
When we combine the punctate enhancement of different levels,
we can imagine that it actually is part of a linear or perivascular
enhancement. Differential diagnosis: Continue with post-treatment images of this patient... CLIPPERS This patient was treated with steroids and the perivascular enhancement is not anymore seen on the follow up exam. Continue with the sagittal images... CLIPPERS pre- and post treatment. Also on the sagittal T2W-images the hyperintensity (yellow arrow) is gone on the follow up image (green arrow). Metastases in the watershed areas These images are of a patient with stage IV lungcancer who was on immune therapy.
She presented with nausea, vomiting and confusion. Initially it was thought that this was PML-IRIS.
The treatment was stopped.
Tests however didn't find any sign of a JC-virus infection and the patient got worse. Finally this proved to be metastases as a result of tumor emboli, that got stuck in the small vessels in the watershed areas.
Periventricular:
Periventricular enhancement follows the subependymal lining of the ventricles.
In case of thin enhancement this is most often caused by an infection, whereas one should think of tumor in case of thick periventricular enhancement.
Ventriculitis:
These images are of a  62-year old male, who presented
with headache, fever and lethargy. Images On the contrast-enhanced FLAIR-images there is a hyperintense lining of the left lateral ventricle representing thin enhancement, better
visible than on the contrast-enhanced T1 W images. This proved to be a Lyme meningitis, which was complicated by
ventriculitis. Continue with some additional images... There is restricted
diffusion in the left ventricle. 
The leptomeningeal enhancement is well appreciated on the contrast-enhanced FLAIR-images (arrowheads). This finding is not specific for lyme meningitis, also other infectious causes should be considered in the differential diagnosis. 
When bilateral enhancement of the facial nerve is present, always consider lyme meningitis. These images are of a patient with a parietal abscess. Images
The abscess shows central diffusion restriction with a relatively thick enhancing wall. 
The yellow arrowheads points towards the thin enhancement of the ventricular wall. Conclusion
Intraventricular
extension of the abscess, which resulted in ventriculitis. These images are of a  63-year old male, who presented with a small cerebral abscess (yellow
arrow) in the right semioval centre.
Notice that there is significant ventricular
involvement. 
Next to the ventricular enhancement, there is diffusion
restriction in the abscess and the ventricle (arrowheads)
GBM subependymal spread:
This patient was previously treated for a GBM and now has a
recurrence in the left frontal lobe. Images
There is thick enhancement along the left
lateral ventricle, which is subependymal tumor spread.
Nodular pattern:
Solid nodular enhancement can be solitary or multiple, ranging from minuscule to larger lesions, with a wide differential diagnosis. 
Always take a close look to the location of the lesions as this can aid in differential diagnosis. On axial images normal vessels can mimic small nodular enhancement.
Septic emboli:
These four images are of a young patient with a pneumococal sepsis who deteriorated and became comatous. ImagesThere are small enhancing nodules (yellow arrowheads) in the watershed areas and at the gray/white matter interface.
There is diffusion restriction (white arrowheads).
This pattern is identical to the previous cases. Conclusion
This was regarded as septic emboli. Mutiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis:
This patient is known with MS. Notice that some of the hyperintense lesions, that are seen on the FLAIR
image, show enhancement on the T1W+Gd image. which is a sign of active disease.
The enhancing lesions
show different patterns of enhancement: nodular and (incomplete) ring. The
lesions are also located in the corpus callosum. 
This
is not a frequent location for metastases or ischemia, but commonly seen in MS.
The location of the
FLAIR abnormalities perpendicular to the ventricles (Dawson fingers), the
juxtacortical location of the white matter lesions and the incomplete
enhancement make the diagnosis of a d emyelinating disease, i.e. MS most likely.
Smooth Ring:
The differential diagnosis of ring enhancing lesions is shown in the table. In this table some findings, that can help to differentiate between various ring-enhancing entities.
Pyogenic Abscess:
The various MR-findings of a pyogenic abscess are shown in the table.
The most typical finding is a peripherally-enhancing lesion with central diffusion restriction. The MR-findings can be false negative when there is bleeding into the abscess and it can be false positive when there is a tumor with infected central necrosis. These images are of a 55-year old male with headache.
First look at the images and then continue reading. Question: The findings are: All these findings are
consistent with the diagnosis of cerebral abscesses.
A double rim on T2W-images can be seen in up to 75% of cases.
Classically there is a complete rim
enhancement and diffusion restriction, but sometimes there is incomplete enhancement as the abscess points
towards the ventricle, ready to empty the pus into the ventricular system. You
can see the beginning of that process in the right frontal abscess. 
When this abscess ruptures into the ventricle the rim will be interrupted and there will be
diffusion restriction within the ventricle. These images are of a patient, who presented with headache. Images
There is a right parietal lesion, with rim enhancement and central diffusion
restriction. 
SWI shows susceptibility at the rim, this is thought to be due to
paramagnetic free radicals, produced by macrophages. 
There is also a
hemorrhagic spot at the ventral side, where diffusion is not restricted.
The faint enhancement
outside the inner rim, due to blood-brain-barriere leakage, can make
differentiation from a tumor difficult, but the restricted diffusion,
together with a low rCBV (not shown) makes the diagnosis of an abscess the most likely Here a more difficult case.
This is a patient, who presented with acute cerebellar
signs. Images
On the T2W-image there is a hyperintense lesion, which shows rim enhancing after contrast
administration.
This is luxury perfusion in an enhancing subacute infarction.
Note also the older infarctions in the left cerebellar hemisphere. When in
doubt, follow-up imaging can help.
Irregular Ring:
In the table the various causes of an irregular ring enhancement.
There is some overlap with smooth ring enhancement. These images are of a  47-year old male, who presented with headache, vomiting and a right-sided hemiparesis. Images
A ring enhancing lesion is present in the left basal ganglia.
Note the enhancing structures within the inner border of the
enhancement.
There is no diffusion restriction, which makes the diagnosis of an abscess unlikely. This is a pathologically proven
GBM. These images are of a 55-year
old patient, who presented with headache and aphasia. First look at the images and then continue reading. ImagesThere is a left
frontotemporal lesion, which is bright on T2W, with thick and irregular ring enhancement.
The lesion follows - and extents into the white matter like
the uncinate fasciculus and the u-fibers.
The centre of the lesion shows no diffusion restriction and no enhancement and is most likely necrosis. The most likely diagnosis is a GMB.
Glial
tumors originate from glial cells in the central nervous system and are
infiltrative tumors. 
GBM’s are the most malignant primary brain
tumors. 
They diffusely infiltrate along the white matter tracts, as e.g. the
corpus callosum. These images are of a patient with metastatic lung carcer. There are two enhancing
metastatic lesions in the left hemisphere. 
On the T1W-image with Gadolinium there is also
extensive enhancement of the vessels making it difficult to detect the metastases.
On the black blood sequence the signal of the blood in the
vessels is suppressed making the recognition of the enhancing metastases easier. In this patient your eye is attracted to a large cystic
lesion in the right parietal lobe with irregular and partially thick enhancement . 
There is mass effect and surrounding edema, without restricted diffusion. One could think of a glioma.
However, there are several other
lesions far apart.
One of them with a characteristic location at the gray-white matter
interface (arrow). 
These turned out to be metastases This patient has a history of lungcarcinoma and presented with headache and mental
slowness. Take a look at the images and then continue reading.
Question: ImagesThere
are multiple connected ring enhancing lesions with surrounding edema in the right hemisphere.
The
lining is relatively thin and smooth with central diffusion restriction.
There
is extension to the right lateral ventricle with enhancement of the ventricular
lining (arrow).
Note also the diffusion restriction at the trigonum of the left lateral
ventricle.
Many thought that this was metastatic disease because of the history, but the findings are more typical for abscesses with ventriculitis, which turned out to be the right diagnosis.
Toxoplasmosis:
These images are of a 50-year old female, who presented with a left-sided
hemiparesis. 
Her medical history was unremarkable. Images
There is a rim-enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe. 
There is no central diffusion restriction, but with an eccentric target sign. 
This
target sign is highly suggestive of cerebral toxoplasmosis. This sign is thought to represent enhancing inflamed vessels
within the abscess cavity. This is a companion case of a 34-year old female, who presented with seizures. Images
There is a rim-enhancing lesion in the
left frontal lobe with a target sign and rim-like diffusion
restriction. 
Note also the low signal intensity on T2W and FLAIR Final diagnosis: toxoplasmosis. As classical bacterial causative agents of abscesses
demonstrate central diffusion restriction, atypical causative agents like fungi
and toxoplasmosis do not, making the diagnosis of a cerebral abscess more
challenging. 
An eccentric target sign as in this case is very helpful for the
diagnosis. This is a challenging case of a 60-year old patient, who presented with headache. Images
There is a right frontal lesion with a thick hyperintense rim, which is already visible on the T1W-image without contrast. After gadolinium a nodule is suggested at the ventral part,
could this be a tumor? 
Let’s take a look at the other sequences. On the FLAIR-image the lesion is relatively hypointense.
On the gradient echo there are susceptibility artefacts at the rim and centrally constistent with hemosiderine. 
There is central diffusion restriction due
to clot formation and the T1W hyperintensity is due to methemoglobine. Findings are consistent with an intraparenchymatous
hemorrhage. 
Because of the suggestion of an underlying lesion, the patient was
operated, but no tumor was found.
Open ring enhancement:
The pattern of an open ring usually suggests a demyelinating disease, but is less frequently seen in an abscess. In demyelinization the ring is mostly open towards the
periphery, while an abscess wants to get rid of the pus centrally into the
ventricles, just like an intracerebral hematoma, that leaks into the
ventricular system.
Tumefactive MS:
These images are of a 50-year old woman, who presented with a
hemiparesis of the left arm and leg. No previous history. First look at the images. What are the findings? Images These findings are typical for tumefactive MS. Dilated central vein Here another tumefactive MS-case.
Notice the dilated vein in the centre of the lesion. Most MS lesions in the cerebral white matter expand outward from small inflamed veins.
This is called a perivenular
distribution. Continue with more images of this patient... There is an incomplete ring enhancement. 
Notice that the open ring points towards the ventricle (arrow), which would favor the diagnosis of an abscess. However,
there
is a central vein on SWI and
on the DWI (not shown) there was no diffusion restriction In this case the open ring does not follow the rule. Here another example of open ring enhancement located in the pons in a patient with demyelinization. These images are of a 52-year old woman who was treated for AML and now presented with paresis of the right arm and difficulty finding the right words. ImagesOn
the contrast-enhanced
T1W-image
there is a hypointense lesion without any mass effect, with incomplete enhancement
of
the wall.
Only
this enhancing part of
the lesion shows diffusion restriction (arrowheads). Conclusion
We regarded this as demyelinization with open ring enhancement. This proved to be progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a demyelinating disorder caused by opportunistic infection of JC virus in patients with severe immunodeficiency.
Abscess:
Although abscesses classically present with a complete ring, they sometimes present with open ring enhancement like in this case. Images
In the left frontal lobe is a lesion with open ring enhancement next to the frontal sinus.
There is a small defect in the wall of the sinus (arrowhead).
The central part of the lesion shows diffusion restriction. Conclusion
Intracerebral abscess as a complication of a frontal sinusitis.
Cyst with Nodule:
In this enhancement pattern, the age of the patient is important for your differential diagnosis. 
In children the differential diagnosis is Pilocytic astrocytoma, Ganglioglioma and Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA).
In adults hemangioblastoma is more
likely.
Pilocytic astrocytoma:
Pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common childhood brain tumor and most often found in the posterior fossa. 
Complete resection usually cures the patient. These images are of a 9-year old child who presented with headache. Images
there is a large cystic posterior fossa mass with compression and
obstruction of the fourth ventricle and brainstem. 
A solid contrast enhancing
nodule is present, as well as enhancement of the cyst wall. Conclusion
Most likely diagnosis at this age is a pilocytic astrocytoma These images are of a 3-year old child who also presented with headache. There are two important findings.
Take a closer look at the images and then continue reading. ImagesLarge cyst with enhancing nodule in the posterior fossa..
Notice that the wall of the cyst enhances.
The nodule is not located on the pial side (inner part of the meninges) unlike in a hemangioblastoma. ConclusionMost likely diagnosis at this age is a pilocytic astrocytoma.
The enhancing wall is part of the tumor and needs to be resected. These images are of a 25-year old man. What are the findings.
Take a closer look at the images and then continue reading. Images
Cystic lesion in the suprasellar region with a solid enhancing nodule complicated by an obstruction hydrocephalus. Conclusion
For
suprasellar lesions, a large differential diagnosis is present (mnemonic
SATCHMO).
On the NECT
there is no calcium in the tumor, which makes a craniopharyngioma unlikely. 
In this location the most likely diagnosis is an optic pathway glioma. 
Most of them are
pilocytic astrocytoma.
In older patients a pilocytic astrocytoma can be located above the level of the tentorium.
Hemangioblastoma:
Hemangioblastoma occurs most often in the cerebellum, where it is the most common primary neoplasm in adults. 
It is less commonly seen in the spinal cord.
They start as a solid nodule and gradually develop a cyst.
The nodule is located on the pial side (inner part of the meninges).
The wall of the cyst is not a part of the tumor and normally they do not enhance, unless in cases when there has been a bleeding within the cyst.
Since the wall is not tumor, it is not necessary to resect the whole cyst. These images are of a 63-year old woman who has von Hippel Lindau disease. Take a closer look. What is barely visible? ImagesThere is a large cyst with a small enhancing nodule in the right cerebellar hemisphere.
The wall of the cyst does not enhance.
Notice that the tumor nodule is located on the pial side (arrow).
There are two more enhancing small nodules on the posterior side of the cerebellum. Multiple tumors are almost always associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. These images are of a 29-year old man. Images
Cystic lesion with a non-enhancing wall and an enhancing nodule on the pial side. Conclusion
Typical hemangioblastoma.
When this tumor is going to be resected, they only have to remove the nodule.

Child abuse - Diagnostic Imaging 2.0:

Non Accidental Trauma:
Simon Robben and Rick van Rijn
Department of Radiology, Maastricht UMC and Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Emma Children’s Hospital - Amsterdam UMC, the Netherlands.:
Publicationdate 2021-11-19 This is the second version of diagnostic imaging in child abuse. Child
abuse is a relatively common problem in our society.
In the Netherlands
it is estimated that 100,000 to 180,000 children a year are abused in some form
or manner. This means that one in thirty children under the age of 18 years has been a victim of abuse. The
incidence of fatal child abuse differs between countries. 
The WHO estimated
that in the year 2000 world-wide 57,000 children were victims of
homicide. More information: Child abuse and neglect. This
overview focusses on the role of diagnostic imaging in depicting the findings
that are specific for physical child abuse.
Awareness
of the radiologist is essential in finding these CNS, skeletal, and abdominal injuries
in order to document child abuse. 
This to stop further abuse, provide help and
intervention for the family, and to protect siblings.
Introduction:
Battered
child syndrome, shaken infant syndrome and non-accidental trauma are all terms
to describe the complex of injuries in infants and young children as a result
of abuse. Shaking
is considered a frequent mechanism of trauma in child abuse, causing  rib fractures, metaphyseal avulsion
fractures, subdural and retinal haemorrhage. 
However  the term “shaken baby syndrome” is now considered
obsolete.
Role of the Radiologist:
The
ability to identify child abuse constitutes an important concern to those
involved in the medical care of children.
Studies
show that at least 10% of children under 5 years old who are brought to the
emergency room with trauma have actually suffered non-accidental trauma. As many
as 65% of all abuse cases are initially seen in the emergency room, the first
step in correctly identifying abuse is therefore to train hospital staff
members to recognize abuse indicators. The wide
range of findings, which can mimic other disease processes or normal variants, implies
that the definitive diagnosis of child abuse can only be achieved though
interdisciplinary collaboration.
Several
studies have reported that 30-80 % of confirmed physical child abuse cases were
missed on initial presentation and many infants sustained additional injury
because of the delay in diagnosis. The
radiologist can be the first to suggest the diagnosis on the basis of imaging studies
performed for  a wide range of clinical
indications. Other roles for the radiologist are listed in the table.
The
future safety of a physically abused child partially rests on the radiologist's
performance of these roles.
CNS injury:
Bilateral hypoechoic subdural fluid collections that outline the arachnoid membrane very well (arrows). The cloudy aspect of the fluid suggests it is hemorrhagic. The subdural hematomas barely show any vessels in contrast with the abundant subarachnoid vessels.
Subdural hematoma:
CNS injury related to non-accidental injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children.
Some state that eighty percent of deaths of children under 2 years of age result from non-accidental head trauma. A baby's neck muscles are very weak and its head is large and heavy in proportion to the rest of its body.
The infant brain is poorly myelinated and is surrounded by larger subarachnoid spaces than the brain in older children and adults. When a baby is shaken, the neck snaps back and forth, much like in a whiplash injury, causing the brain to rotate and hit the front and back of the skull. This can damage the brain and cause it to bruise, bleed and swell. 
Imaging studies of the head may show subdural or subarachnoid bleeding, diffuse axonal injury and associated cerebral edema or older injuries such as subdural effusions. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. This is a video of a color doppler in another child with bilateral subdural hematomas. Notice again that the subdural hematomas show no vessels in contrast with the abundant subarachnoid vessels. Although
haemorrhage can occur at any site, the tendency is for blood to extend into the
interhemispheric fissure (arrow on image on the right). Image
Left parietal hyperdense subdural hematoma and small right
fronto-parietal subdural hematoma extending into the interhemispheric fissure. MR
examination is more sensitive in detecting subdural hematomas. 
In all
cases we advise to add susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequences to the
imaging protocol. Images
Subtle subdural hematoma on CT is seen to a better advantage on
T2-weighted MRI and the hemosiderin deposits are evident on the SWI (arrows). The American
Academy of Pediatrics proposed to use the term Abusive Head Trauma (AHT). Another commonly used term is Inflicted Traumatic Brain Injury (ITBI). The
classic trauma mechanism described is violently shaking the child back and
forth whilst firmly holding the child around the chest. 
However, this can occur
with and without an impact trauma. 
Direct impact trauma without shaking can
also occur.
A
shaking incident causes the extremities and the head to flail back and forth in
a whiplash movement. It is important to note that there are no pathognomonic radiological findings for abusive head trauma. For each case multidisciplinary input and collaboration is mandatory. Perfusion defects are a major component of long
term damage. 
Therefore diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) should also be part of the
standard MR imaging protocol. Images
2-month-old boy with metaphyseal avulsion fractures, rib fractures and
convulsions. T2-weighted image shows subtle right frontal subdural fluid
collection, but massive diffusion restriction on DWI. It is
important to note that there is no evidence base for dating subdural hematomas
on CT or MRI. 
From a medico-legal perspective radiologists should therefore
refrain from dating. (ref 1) ImageT1-weighted image shows bilateral chronic subdural hematomas with
internal membranes that create  hyperintense  compartments. 
This is suggestive of
rebleed, but not definitive evidence for that.
Spinal cord injury:
Cervical
spine compression results as shaking or impact injury damages the spinal cord. Infants
are vulnerable to spinal cord injury because of their large head and weak
underdeveloped paraspinous and neck musculature. Spinal cord injury may be
difficult to document. These infants may exhibit apnoea or vasomotor collapse
similar to spinal shock. Subdural
hematomas can also be found along the spine, with a preference for the lumbar
spine. MRI child abuse protocols should therefore include imaging of the spine.
Skeletal Injury:
From Kleinman PK, Rosenberg AE, Tsai A. Skeletal trauma: general considerations. In Kleinman PK. Diagnostic imaging of child abuse. Mosby, 3rd edition, 2015, 23 – 52.
Specificity of fractures:
When we
look at pediatric radiographs at the emergency department, we have to realize,
that the forces needed to break a bone in an infant or young child are significant.
Any
fracture in this age group indicates a traumatic event. The
levels of specificity for child abuse given a fracture are listed in the table
on the left. The
classical metaphyseal corner or bucket handle fracture is virtually
pathognomonic for abuse, although a differential diagnosis does exist. Rib
fractures are very common and highly specific for abuse in young children less
than 2 year. 
The positive predictive value of posterior rib fractures with
respect to child abuse have been reported to be 80% - 90%. Fractures
of the acromion, sternum and spinous processes are so rare in accidental conditions,
that this gives them a high specificity for abuse. Typical corner fracture very specific for non accidental trauma
Corner fracture:
The metaphyseal
corner fracture, also dubbed by Kleinman as the classic metaphyseal lesion,  was first described by Caffey who noted these
peculiar fractures in children with subdural hematomas. They are often
bilateral and in the distal tibia seen more often at the medial side. When a
small piece of bone is avulsed due to shearing forces on the fragile growth
plate it is seen as the typical corner fracture. These fractures are most
common in the tibia, distal femora and proximal humeri. They are frequently
bilateral. These
fractures are often subtle, and the likelihood of detection is directly related
to the quality of the radiologic studies. It is
for this reason that skeletal surveys in cases of suspected child abuse must be
performed with utmost attention to the quality of the radiographs.
Bucket handle fractures:
Bucket handle fractures are essentially the same as corner fractures. 
The avulsed bone
fragment is larger and seen 'en face' as a disc or bucket handle. Images
Bucket handle fracture in proximal tibia. The metaphyseal fracture fragment is seen as a disk or bucket handle.
Rib fractures:
In
violent shaking the child is held very tightly around the chest and squeezed
while being shaken. This compresses
the ribs front to back and tends to break them next to their attachment to
vertebrae and laterally where they are being literally almost folded in half. As a
result of this specific trauma mechanism, lateral and posterior rib fractures
are highly specific for abuse. Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation is rarely, if ever, a cause of such fractures. Old posterior rib fractures very indicative of non accidental trauma. These rib fractures in abused children may be found incidentally on chest X-rays performed for other reasons, such as evaluation for pneumonia.
Rib fractures are highly specific for abuse. In a study in the Netherlands a total of 254 fractures were found in 56 cases of abusive head trauma. There was an extremely high incidence of rib fractures and metaphyseal fractures (ref). Rib fractures pose difficulties similar to those of metaphyseal injuries in that they are easily overlooked on radiographs.
In the acute stage they are not evident on radiographs, as little displacement occurs.
They are often identified on the repeated skeletal survey when the fractures are in the healing stage showing callus. Especially
fractures at the ventral ends of the ribs are challenging. Ultrasonography
is helpful in detecting dislocation at the ventral costo-chondral junction. Images
Child evaluated for soft tissue mass in costchondral region. The ultrasound shows soft tissue swelling (yellow arrows), chondral part of rib (red arrow) disrupted from bony part (orange arrow) of rib. The Initial chest film was negative. Chest film 2 weeks later showed fractures. LEFT: eggshell fractures in a child who died of cerebral injury after being thrown from a height. RIGHT: skull fracture in abused child
Skull fractures:
Skull
fractures are common child abuse injuries, but they are also common in
accidental trauma. Patterns
of skull fracture that suggest child abuse are: The
infant's skull is rather resistant to trauma, so any fracture that is not
consistent with the history should raise the question of non-accidental injury. Two infants with a femur fracture. Child abuse was suspected because of the age of the child and an inconsistent history given by the parents.
Diaphyseal fractures:
Diaphyseal
fractures are non-specific as they do occur in both accidental and
non-accidental injury.
However
in these cases the age and developmental stage of the child and the clinical
history is very important. A fall
out of a bed will usually not produce a diaphyseal fracture.
In order
to acquire a transverse diaphyseal fracture of the femur a considerable amount
of power has to be applied. Spiral
fractures are a result of twisting forces.
Although
often stated there is no evidence that a spiral fracture of the lower extremity
has a higher specificity of abuse compared to oblique or transverse fractures. Diaphyseal femur fracture with a lot of callus is at least 2 weeks old.
Fracture healing:
Callus
in diaphyseal fractures generally forms no earlier than 5 days after a
fracture, but will usually form by 14 days.
Thus,
fractures without visible callus may be up to 14 days old, and fractures which
demonstrate a little bit of callus are at least 5 days old. Large amounts of
callus indicate at least 2 weeks old. These
signs can be used to correlate with the history. For instance a child that fell
out of bed the day before cannot have a fracture with callus formation. Although
it is impossible to exactly date a fracture it is clearly possible to discern
different healing stages within a case. Thus having an evidential value for
multiple incidents leading to the fractures.
Metaphyseal
fractures and skull fractures typically do not heal with callus as there is no
periosteal disruption, so dating of metaphyseal fractures is difficult.
Abdominal injuries:
In
general visceral injuries in children are rare, however when diagnosed common
abdominal injuries in abused children are: Visceral injury is seen at autopsy of young infants, but it is rarely documented radiologically in living victims less than 1 year of age. It is estimated that 2-10% of all abdominal injury results from child abuse. The mean age of these children is about 2 years, which is older than the cases we have discussed before. It is more common in boys than girls. The mortality rate in abdominal injuries is 50% due to 'patients and doctors delay'.
These children are brought to the hospital days after the injury, when a perforation already has resulted in peritonitis and sepsis.
The history given by the abusers usually does not correlate with the symptoms, which makes these cases very difficult to evaluate for the clinician. Image
The CT shows pancreatic laceration in child abuse. These abdominal injuries are non-specific and could also be attributed to accidental injury. However in most of these cases of child abuse, there is a history that does not correlate well with the injuries, that are found. So you have to look for other more specific skeletal injuries in these children. Image
Liver laceration in child abuse
Retinal hemorrhage:
Retinal haemorrhage
is seen in a high proportion of cases of infant abuse in which shaking is
documented. Ophthalmologic
examination is the gold standard, but sometimes the retinal abnormalities can
be seen with MRI.
As
retinal haemorrhages can resolve in a short time span the ophthalmologic
examination should be done within 24 hours after presentation. Images
The SWI shows bilateral subdural hematomas in a 3-month-old abused girl.
The T2W-image shows subtle retinal thickening in the right eye
and detached retina on the left.
Imaging survey in suspected abuse:

Initial skeletal survey:
A protocol for imaging in suspected abuse should be
present in every hospital. Radiographic
skeletal survey is necessary in all children less than 2 years old suspected of
abuse. In children over the age of 2 a skeletal survey should only be done on
indication. It has
been defined by the Royal College of Radiologists and the Society and College
of Radiographers and consists of the radiographs shown in the table (ref). The authors do not encourage the use of a single
exposure of the extremities, but prefer individual radiographs of each long bone.
Follow-up skeletal survey:
After
two weeks a limited repeated skeletal survey shown in the table on the left
should be performed. This skeletal survey may provide evidence of a healing
injury, that was unapparent on the initial study. Expert
attention to technique and detail is necessary to get quality radiographs that
show some of the very subtle injuries of abuse.
Never
ever perform a 'babygram'. Remember
that these are the radiographs that will go to court. Nuclear
bone scan is usually not necessary. Perform this only if there are equivocal
findings on the skeletal survey or if there is a high clinical suspicion of
skeletal injury but the skeletal survey is normal. 
Conventional radiographs of
the areas of abnormality identified at bone scan, are still needed to evaluate
for the exact nature of the abnormality.
Brain CT in suspected abuse:
CT of
the brain should be performed on all suspected abuse victims under one year old. Children
who are older than one year and have external evidence of head trauma and/or
abnormal neurological symptoms or signs should also have a CT scan of the head. A CT
scan is superior in detecting skull fractures (especially 3D reconstructions)
and demonstrates subdural haemorrhages (ref).
Differential diagnosis:
1 day old child with multiple fractures after a problematic delivery. Birth weight was 5500 grams.
Accidental injury:
Accidental
subdural haemorrhages have been reported in infants after motor vehicle
collisions or falls involving substantial angular deceleration. In cases
of accidental head injury, the history is clear and consistent, the infant's
symptoms reflect the forces described, and no unexplained skeletal injuries are
identified. Birth
trauma resulting from high birth weight and traumatic delivery has been
postulated as a cause of rib fractures in infants, but this is extremely rare
(figure). Rib
fractures associated with accidental trauma are rare and require significant
force to produce such as direct chest wall trauma from motor vehicle crashes,
because the elastic and more flexible chest wall of infants allows for greater
compression without injury. Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation also has been implicated as a cause for rib fractures. Many
critically ill children receive CPR and have no evidence of rib fractures. More
important, CPR has not been reported to cause posterior rib fractures.
Coagulopathies:
A variety of coagulopathies is associated with intracranial hemorrhage in infants, including hemophilia and hypoprothrombinemia caused by vitamin K deficiency. 
These disorders are suggested by the clinical history, physical findings, and laboratory tests. Osteopenia and fracture in a child with osteogenesis imperfecta.
Osteogenesis imperfecta:
Osteogenesis imperfecta is a rare inherited disorder of connective tissue. 
 Other skeletal findings in these patients are generalized osteoporosis, wormian bones, bowing and angulation of healed fractures and progressive scoliosis. In addition to fractures, suggestive findings include blue sclerae, hearing impairment, dentinogenesis imperfecta, hypermobility of the joints, bruising and short stature. Subdural hemorrhage is a rare complication of the disease.
Menke's disease:
Menke's disease is a very uncommon inborn error of metabolism. In these patient's small metaphyseal hooks can be seen that resemble corner fractures. Image
Small metaphyseal hooks seen in a patient with Menke's disease.
Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia:
Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, 'corner fracture' type is a skeletal dysplasia associated with short stature, developmental coxa vara, progressive hip deformity, simulated 'corner fractures' of long tubular bones and vertebral body abnormalities. Image
The x-rays show a rare case
of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia corner fracture type.
In these
children the form of the metaphysis is irregular resembling an old corner
fracture. However, vertebral anomalies are also present.
Caffey's disease:
This is
a rare disease of unknown aetiology.
These
children have extreme periosteal reactions. This can lead to the erroneous
diagnosis of healing fractures. Image
Abundant periosteal bone formation in a case of Caffey's disease
Normal variants:
The
pointed appearance of the metaphyseal borders (beaks or spurs) may simulate
metaphyseal avulsion fractures. 
Another normal variant is the metaphyseal
collar. Image
1.5 year-old-boy with accidental spiral fissure of the left femoral
shaft. Initially, the metaphyseal collar (white arrows) and metaphyseal spur
(red arrow) were interpreted as torus fractures and metaphyseal avulsion
fracture, respectively. This raised suspicion for non-accidental injury. However, these are
normal variants. The
proximal shaft of the tibial may show a small prominence of unknown origin that
may be mistaken for a torus fracture. Christian CW, Block R, Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect; American Academy of Pediatrics. Pediatrics. 2009 May;123(5):1409-11

COVID-19 is a viral disease also known as SARS-CoV-2 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The diagnosis is made by a positive PCR test, which is highly specific. CT has a higher sensitivity but lower specificity and can play a role in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

Introduction:

Clinical Features:
COVID-19 usually presents with fever (85%), cough (70%) and shortness of breath (43%), but abdominal and other symptoms are possible and the disease can be asymptomatic.
Overal mortality rate is 2.3% in some series of patients who had a positive test for COVID-19.
Since we do not know the number of people who were infected but not tested for the virus, the actual mortality rate of all the people that are infected is probably much lower. Illness severity can vary from mild to critical.
PCR-test:
The PCR-test is very specific, but has a lower sensitivity of 65-95%, which means that the test can be negative even when the patient is infected.
Another problem is, that you have to wait for the test results, which can take more than 24 hours, while CT results are available right away.
Common laboratory findings in COVID-19 are a decreased lymphocyte count and an increased CRP and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level.

Ground glass:
Ground glass (GGO) pattern is the most common finding in COVID-19 infections.
They are usually multifocal, bilateral and peripheral, but in the early phase of the disease the GGO may present as a unifocal lesion, most commonly located in the inferior lobe of the right lung (6). CT-images of a young male, who had fever for ten days with progressive coughing and shortness of breath.
Saturation at admission was 66%.
The PCR test was positive for COVID-19. There are widespread bilateral ground-glass opacities with a posterior predominance.
Crazy paving:
Sometimes there are thickened interlobular and intralobular lines in combination with a ground glass pattern.
This is called crazy paving. It is believed that this pattern is seen in a somewhat later stage.
Vascular dilatation:
A typical finding in the area of ground glass is widening of the vessels (arrow).
Traction Bronchiectasis:
Another common finding in the areas of ground glass is traction bronchiectasis (arrows).
Subpleural bands and Architectural distortion:
In some case there is architectural distortion with the formation of subpleural bands. Enable Scroll

CT involvement score:
The severity of the lung involvement on the CT correlates with the severity of the disease. Visual assessment
The severity on CT can be estimated by visual assessment.
This is the easiest way to score the severity.
The CT images show a 25% involvement by visual assessment. Severity score
Another method is by scoring the percentages of each of the five lobes that is involved: 75% involvement. The total CT score is the sum of the individual lobar scores and can range from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement), when all the five lobes show more than 75% involvement.
Some say that the percentage of lung involvement can be calculated by multiplying the total score times 4.
This however is not true. Suppose that all lobes have a 10% involvement, then this would lead to an overall score of 10, which could lead to the impression that 40% of the lungs are involved. Common Patterns and Distribution on Initial CT Images of 919 patients COVID-19 (4).
Initial CT-findings:
Initial CT-findings in COVID-19 cases include bilateral, multilobar ground glass opacification (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and less frequently in the middle lobe (4). 
Consolidation superimposed on GGO as the initial imaging presentation is found in a smaller number of cases, mainly in the elderly population. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement are some of the less common findings, mainly in the later stages of the disease. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, CT halo sign, and pneumothorax are some of the uncommon but possible findings seen with disease progression. There is much overlap of the CT-pattern of COVID-19 with other viral pneumonias. Enable Scroll

Possible role of CT:
CT can play a role in: Triage Some published clinical guidelines recommend chest CT for patients with suspected COVID-19. The decision to use of CT for triage depends on many considerations:

Arthroplasty of the Hip:

Normal and abnormal imaging findings:
Iain Watt, Susanne Boldrik, Evert van Langelaan and Robin Smithuis
from the Radiology Departments of the Leids University Hospital, Leiden; the Medical Centre Alkmaar, Alkmaar and the Orthopedic and Radiology Department of the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2006-02-01 Radiography is the primary imaging method for the evaluation of Total Hip Arthroplasty. This overview focusses on the normal findings and complications of cemented versus non-cemented hip arthroplasties. Interactive cases are presented in the menubar to test your knowledge on hipprostheses.
Total Hip Arthroplasty systems:
LEFT: Assembled cementless Mallory Head prosthesis.RIGHT: Femoral stem with proximal porous coating for bone ingrowth, separate metal femoral head, polyethylene acetabular liner with a porous coated metal backing. Modern Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) systems are modular. This means that the femoral stem, head, acetabular shell and liner are separate pieces. This modularity allows for greater flexibility in customizing prosthesis sizing and fit. The acetabular part is usually a polyethylene liner with or without metal backing. Fixation is with cement, spikes, screws or cementless with porous coating for bone ingrowth. The femoral part is composed of a metal stem (chromium cobalt or titanium) and a femoral head of metal or ceramic. Stem-fixation is also either with cement or cementless with porous coating for bone ingrowth. Most modern non-cemented THA have a femoral stem with only proximal coating, as this results in a better longterm outcome
than fully coated (less loosening). Some of the non-cemented THA have femoral stems with additional hydroxyapatite coating
which further improve bone ingrowth. This coating is not visible on radiographs. LEFT: Hybrid THA with cemented femoral stem and noncemented acetabular cup.RIGHT: Bone ingrowth arthroplasty. Density lateral to femoral stem in Gruens zone I is a bone graft. Hybrid total hip replacements are a combination of cement- and cementless fixation. As cemented acetabular components have a tendency to loosen over time, the combination of a cementless acetabular component with a cemented femoral component is sometimes used. Overall there is a tendency to use preferably non-cemented THA, which have better longterm results. On the left we see a hybrid THA with bone-ingrowth acetabular cup and cemented femoral component and next to it a non-cemented bone ingrowth THA.
Initial Evaluation:
The initial films serve as a baseline study and are used as reference films for comparison with all future studies, since sequential radiography is the most valuable method for detecting complications. The initial postoperative films are obtained to look for possible dislocation or fracture and to see if the prosthesis is good positioned. LEFT: Revision THA with a large femoral stem with periprosthetic fracture.RIGHT: Cement extrusion intrapelvic through acetabular defect. Dislocation Dislocation can occur as a late complication in prostheses that are not well positioned, but it is most common in the immediate postoperative period (incidence 3%). Periprosthetic fractures Fractures may be seen postoperatively in patients with poor bone stock and long stem revision prostheses or
when the anatomy is abnormal as in hip dysplasia. or prior surgery. They are also more common in non-cemented femoral stems, as these have to fit exactly and can cause a fracture during insertion. The incidence of fractures ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 percent for cemented components and 3 to 18 percent for uncemented components. Most intraoperative fractures occur on the femoral side. Cement extrusion When the acetabulum is prepared for placement of the cup a perforation may occur. This defect is filled with bone chips, cement or bone transplant.
Cement extrusion is usually asymptomatic.
 Rare complications include bowel fistulas, encasement of neurovascular structures and bladder wall burn. Measurement of lateral acetabular inclination. Right trochanter minor is lower in position than the left indicating leg length dicrepancy.Normal horizontal center of rotation (red line).
Alignment and Positioning:
Acetabular and femoral component positioning should mimic normal anatomy. The distance from center of the femoral head to teardrop (or other identifiable landmark) should be equal bilaterally. This is called the horizontal center of rotation. Excessive lateral positioning of the acetabular component increases the risk for dislocation and may cause limping. The transischial line is used as a reference to measure the lateral inclination of the acetabular cup (30-50?). This line is also used to measure any leg length discrepancy. Leg length discrepancy up to 1 cm is well tolerated. A high positionened cup is better tolerated than a lateral positioned cup. Different anteversion of the acetabular cup in the same patient due to different rotation on a cross table view (left) compared to a lateral view (right). The anteversion of the acetabular cup should be 5-25?. Exact measurement of this angle on a cross-table or true lateral radiograph is not possible
, since the apparent degree of angulation on a radiograph is affected by pelvic or thigh rotation (figure). Measurement with CT is more accurate, but you still have to compensate for pelvic angulation. LEFT: Femoral head with large collar. Dislocation due to increased lateral inclination of acetabular cupRIGHT: Different patient at risk for dislocation. High and lateral position of a steep acetabular cup. Notice polyethylene wear due to increased forces on the superolateral side of the cup. The following conditions predispose to dislocation: Increased lateral inclination of the acetabular cup. Decreased or increased anteversion of the cup. Excessive lateral positioning of the acetabular cup Increased or decreased anteversion of the femoral stem. Due to increased forces on the superolateral margin of the cup, increased lateral inclination of the acetabular
component also may increase the risk of polyethylene wear of the acetabular liner (see figure). Varus position of femoral stem leading to loosening and fracture. The preferred position of the femoral component is with the stem centered in the femoral canal. The center of rotation of the femoral head should be at the level of the tip of the greater trochanter. Varus position of the femoral stem predisposes to loosening and fracture.
Normal Findings at Follow up:
LEFT: Normal cement-metal interface (yellow arrow). However loosening at cement-bone interface (orange curved arrow).RIGHT: At follow up also loosening at cement-metal interface.
Cemented THA:
Normal findings in cemented-THA are different from non-cemented prostheses as the native bone shows more reactive changes to non-cemented prostheses. In cemented THA ideally you would not expect any lucencies at the bone-cement or cement-prosthesis interface, but even in stable cemented prostheses they do occur. A lucency at the metal-cement interface along the proximal lateral aspect of the femoral stem may be seen on the initial postoperative radiograph as a reflection of suboptimal metal-cement contact at the time of surgery. A stable lucent zone is good, but if the lucency enlarges or develops at the metal-cement interface during follow up, then it is a sign of loosening (figure). Ideally there is only a 3-4mm layer of cement around the prosthesis. Abundant cement packing leads to loosening. Acetabular zones according to De Lee and CharnleyFemoral zones according to Gruen At the bone-cement interface a thin fibrous layer may form as responce to local necrosis of osseous tissue due to the heat of the cement-polymerization. It becomes stable by 2 years. On radiographs this layer is seen as a lucent zone. Especially in acetabular zone I a 1-2 mm lucency is frequently seen at the bone-cement interface, this is a normal finding provided it is stable. If also other zones are involved and the lucency widens, it is however a sign of loosening. In your report always indicate which zones are involved (figure). In the acetabulum you have three zones marked I-III. It is quite common to see a radio lucent line in zone I, but you shouldn't see it in zone II and III. Similarly in the femur there are zones 1 - 7. It is very common to see radiolucency in zone 1, occasionally in zone 7, but it should not occur in the subtrochanteric region zones 2-6. Manipulated image showing normal reactions to the some of the uncemented hip prostheses.
Non Cemented THA:
The implantation of a bone ingrowth prosthesis results in altered stress distribution to the native bone, especially in the older models with non tapered and fully coated femoral stems. Stress shielding proximally may result in proximal osteoporosis and calcar resorption. Stress loading distally may result in cortical thickening and bridging sclerosis at the tip of the prosthesis ( called pedestal). In an effort to avoid these changes, most modern cementless prosthesis only have fixation proximally, so you usually will not find proximal stress shielding. The distal part of the femoral prosthesis is not 'loaded', so there will be no distal stress loading. In stable non-cemented hip arthroplasties lucent zones at the metal-bone interface do occur, as it usually is a combination of bone ingrowth and fibrous tissue ingrowth, that provides the fixation in most cases. This fibrous tissue presents as a lucent zone at the interface. Again it should be stable and well within a range of 1 -2 mm. The figure on the left sums all the findings in some of the non-cemented prostheses, that can be normal. You have to be familiar with the normal and abnormal changes in the types of prostheses, that are used by your orthopaedic surgeons. Normal lucent zone: Thin lucent zones along the bone-metal interface due to fibrous tissue are therefore common (80%). They should be less than 2mm and accompanied by a sclerotic line parallel to it. If they stay stable for 2 years than fixation by a strong fibrous tissue has taken place. Progressive calcar resorption during folllow up. Stress shielding or bone resorption is seen in areas that are relatively unstressed. The forces are transmitted through the relative stiff femoral stem and is seen as osteoporosis in the
proximal femur with thinning of the cortex and bone resorption of the femoral neck. This is seen medially as calcar resorption, as the calcar has lost it's function (figure). It is also called calcar round off.
Complications at Follow Up:
There are many complications in THA. Radiographic follow up and comparison with the oldest films available is the most valuable method of detecting these complications. The most important complications are mechanical loosening, particle disease and infection. These complications however may have similar imaging findings and overlap exists. Illustration of the typical radiographic changes in Loosening (left) - Particle disease (middle) - Infection (right) Mechanical loosening presents as diffuse lucency. Particle disease presents as focal lucency. Evidence of polyethylene wear, which appears as asymmetric positioning of the femoral head within the acetabular cup, often coexists with particle disease.
. Infection presents as irregular lucency with periosteal reaction, but may be difficult to differentiate from loosening and particle disease.In typical cases the imaging findings of loosening, particle disease and infection are straight forward (figure). Infection is often low grade and is difficult to detect with any imaging method. In more agressive cases there will be irregular osteolysis, no sclerotic border, cortical bone resorption and a periosteal reaction. Progressive lucent zone around acetabular component in zone I and II. Steeper position of the cup indicates migration. Subtle excentric positioning of the femoral head is indicative of polyethylene wear.
Loosening:
Mechanical loosening remains the most common indication for revision. Patients are usually symptomatic, although asymptomatic radiographic changes may be seen. The most common radiographic manifestation of loosening are: Lucent zone > 2 mm at interface (indicative) Component migration (diagnostic). A lucent zone of more than 2 mm at the bone-prosthesis interface or at the bone-cement interface is very indicative of loosening. Especially if more zones are involved and if there is progression. A lucent zone Component migration is diagnostic for loosening. It is seen as tilting or cranial migration of the acetabular cup or as subsidence (>10mm) and varus tilting of the femoral stem. The case on the left shows progressive subsidence, which is diagnostic for loosening, with subsequent break of the screws. Loosening (2) As migration can be very subtle, it requires carefull comparison with the initial postoperative films. Do not just compare to the prior examination. The case on the left shows migration of the acetabular cup, which is better appreciated if a reference point is used (see next figure) Same case as above with white marks on the tear drop figure. Migration is shown more easily. Blue arrow indicates acetabular fracture. If we look at the same radiographs and we use the tear drop figure as a landmark, the migration becomes more evident. Migration of the cup in cranial direction has resulted in a fracture in the acetabular wall (blue arrow). Migration of acetabular cup cranially with tilting and subsequent acetabular fracture Migration of acetabular components is never acceptable. It is seen as upward movement or tilting of the cup (figure) The case on the left is for several reasons not ideal : High and very lateral positioning of the cup. Too much lateral inclination. Abundant cement packing. Screws are positioned too horizontally (too much stress). Lucency in zone II and III > 2 mm. Especially lucency in these zones is very indicative of loosening. During follow up upward migration with increased tilting is seen causing the fixation screw to break. Eccentric position of femoral head within cup consistent with polyethylene wear.Focal osteolysis with endosteal scalloping in proximal femur due to particle disease.
Particle Disease:
Originally this was called cement disease or aggressive granulomatosus. It is a histiocytic response that occurs as a result of macrophage reaction to any of the components, that are shed of the surface of the components of the arthroplasty. Nowadays it is mostly seen in non-cemented hips as a reaction to small polyethylene wear particles. Radiographically these aggressive granulomatous lesions present as focal radiolucencies around the prosthesis. The condition tends to occur between 1 and 5 years after surgery and is associated with smooth endosteal scalloping. The key feature is that it produces no secondary bone response. These characteristics help to distinguish small particle disease from infection, which often has more aggressive features, although the distinction is not always possible. Although particle disease is a result of polyethylene wear, you will not always see evident findings of polyethyleen wear in the acetabular cup,
but whenever you see an eccentric position of the femoral head within the cup, look for focal lucencies. Large focal defects may be seen while the prosthesis is still stable. Particle Disease is relentlessly progressive with loosening, fracture and destruction of bone. Sometimes revision of a stable THA is needed because more bone loss would make revision surgery impossible. Subtle eccentric position of femoral head. Even more subtle focal osteolysis around screw in acetabulum. Particle Disease (2) The small wear-particles of the polyethylene liner are shed into the joint fluid and can be transported around the prosthesis through small channels even in stable hips. They have a tendency to be transported through screw holes (figure). This is why surgeons are more and more reluctant to use screws for the fixation of acetabular cups. Another case on the left. Again there is focal osteolysis around screws after migration of wear particles through the screwholes. Eccentric position of femoral head within acetabular cup as a result of polyethylene wear. Creep is normal remoulding and is superomedial. Wear is superolateral and pathologic
Polyethylene wear:
Normal loading of the polyethylene cup comes up the femoral shaft, along the femoral neck towards the lumbar spine. So it is normal to see slight thinning in the area of the weight bearing as the plastic moulds itself. This remoulding of the cup is called creep. Abnormal loading leads to pressure more lateral, resulting in polyethylene wear on the supero-lateral side.
Infection:
Radiologic findings in patients with low grade infection may be unremarkable or may mimic loosening or small particle disease. With more aggressive organisms, progression can be rapid, with bone destruction and sinus tract formation, resulting in radiological findings as listed in the table on the left. Uniform criteria for the diagnosis of infection associated with prostheses have not been established. In several studies infection was diagnosed if at least one of the following criteria was present: Same microorganism in two cultures of synovial fluid. Purulence of synovial fluid at the implant site Inflammation on pathological examination of periprosthetic tissue. Presence of a sinus tract communicating with the prosthesis. Irregular periprosthetic bone resorption with periosteal reaction typical for infection. On the left the typical radiographic findings of infection with irregular bone destruction and periosteal reaction. In many cases however the infection is really low grade and difficult to establish. Radionuclide bone scans are very sensitive for infection, but not specific as they may show findings similar to those occurring in loosening. Negative findings on a bone scan suggest that no infection exists. The role of dedicated radionuclide techniques for infection such as gallium scanning or indium-labeled WBC or immunoglobulin G is not clear,
but they tend to be a bit more specific compared to normal Technetium bone scan. Most researchers advocate fluoroscopic or sonographic guided joint aspiration to assess infection. Several samples should be taken to minimize confusion caused by skin contaminants. Infections up to one year after the insertion of the prosthesis are acquired during implantation. The risk of intraoperative infection is less than 1% due to the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and laminar airflow surgical environment. Late infections are acquired by hematogenous seeding from respiratory tract, dental and urinary tract infections.
Fractures:
Incidence post-operative: cemented THA: 0.4% press fit prosthesis: 2.5% revision hip arthroplasty: 7.2% Usually it does not affect outcome, but may require cerclage cables. 
Sometimes a control perforation is placed by the surgeon during revision to aid in removal of the previously placed femoral component. 
Fractures during follow up are a result of loosening, particle disease, infection or severe cases of stress shielding. Lateral dislocation of THA
Dislocation:
As discussed above, dislocation or subluxation of the components may occur because of patient factors including poor muscle tone or trauma or because of surgical factors such as a posterior (rather than lateral) surgical approach. Another factor is difficulty in achieving ideal angulation of the acetabular component. This is usually the result of severe degenerative changes or dysplasia. Dislocation can be in posterior, anterior or lateral direction. Tilting of loose cup resulting in dislocation On the left another case with dislocation as a result of tilting of the cup due to loosening.
Component fracture:
Component fracture is uncommon. The case on the left is probably secondary to severe polyethylene wear
resulting in cup and cement fracture. Component dissociation, as opposed to component fracture, most commonly develops when the plastic liner of the acetabulum slips from its backing. Destruction of polyethylene liner The case on the left shows severe wear and fracture of the polyethylene liner. The metal backing is still intact. The case on the left shows a fracture of the metal head of the femoral component. Classification of heterotopic ossification according to Brooker
Heterotopic Ossification:
The classification of heterotopic ossification includes four grades based on an AP radiograph of the pelvis and hip. Grade I = islands of bone within soft tissues. Grade II = bone spurs leaving > 1 cm between opposing bone surfaces. Grade III = bone spurs leaving < 1 cm between opposing bone surfaces. Grade IV = radiographic ankylosis of the hip. Various degrees of heterotopic ossification Heterotopic Ossification occurs when primitive mesenchymal cells in the surrounding soft tissues are transformed into osteoblastic cells, that form mature lamellar bone. It typically occurs around the femoral neck and adjacent to the greater trochanter and occurs in 15-50% of patients. Many patients with radiographically low-grade heterotopic ossification are asymptomatic. If it becomes symptomatic, hip stiffness is the most common complaint and pain is rarely a problem.

Bosniak Classification 2019:

Cystic Renal Masses:
Chris Lunt and Frederieke Elsinger
BC Cancer Agency Vancouver and Luzerner Kantonsspital:
Publicationdate 1-2-2022 In this article we describe the 2019 Bosniak classification of renal cystic lesions.
The goals of the new 2019 Bosniak classification are to reduce interobserver variability, improve the precision rate of malignancy within each category and to increase specificity and thereby reducing the rate of unnecessary treatment of benign lesions.
Overview:
A cystic renal mass is defined as a lesion in which <25% of the mass is composed of enhancing tissue The Bosniak 2019 classification defines a cystic renal mass as one in which <25% of the mass is composed of enhancing tissue in order to avoid an aggressive necrosed solid renal mass being termed Bosniak IV. Bosniak I and Bosniak II masses that are characterized as benign may be described as “cysts” and the term “cystic renal mass” should be applied to Bosniak IIF, III and IV lesions. Terms such as ‘complicated cyst’ or ‘complex cyst’ can be confusing and should be avoided. Bosniak I Bosniak II Six types, all well-defined with thin (≤ 2 mm) smooth walls: Bosniak IIF Two types: Bosniak III One or more enhancing thick (≥ 4 mm width) or enhancing irregular (displaying ≤ 3-mm obtusely margined convex protrusion[s]) walls or septa. Bosniak IV One or more enhancing nodules (≥ 4-mm convex protrusion with obtuse margins, or a convex protrusion of any size that has acute margins) This table summarizes the Bosniak 2019 classification.. Portal venous scan of a cyst with mean HU of 25 in the anterior right Kidney. According to the new Bosniak criteria all cyst with HU <30 are likely benign and can be classified as Bosniak II without any additional imaging
Malignancy rate:
Bosniak I masses are universally considered to be benign, and although there are occasional case reports of malignancy being found in these lesions, this is thought to be due to incorrect scan technique or incorrect image interpretation leading to incorrectly assigning a Bosniak I grade. Malignancy rates in Bosniak II lesions are <1% and may be as low a 0%. A caveat to this is in patients with Von Hippel Lindau syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and other RCC syndromes where benign appearing cystic masses may still harbor malignancy and the application of the Bosniak system is not recommended. The incidence of malignancy in Bosniak IIF lesions is reported between 0-38% likely owing to differences in subjective grading of imaging features as well as strong selection bias whereby only the more worrisome lesions are resected. However, lesions in which there is progression of features from IIF to category III or IV have a high rate of malignancy of 85%, comparable to lesions initially characterised as Bosniak IV. Bosniak III lesions are considered indeterminate with around half being malignant. Current practice regarding resection or observation varies between institutions and depends heavily on lesion size, patient comorbidities and surgeon preference. Bosniak IV lesions are found to be malignant in around 90% of cases and treatment is recommended in most cases if patient characteristics allow The system is used to predict the likelihood of cancer, not the biologic behavior. 
It is unclear which criteria are more predictive for cancer aggressiveness than others. Size and growth rate are not included in the updated classification. It is however likely that the smaller the lesion, the more likely it is to be benign. Growth rate and change of morphology do however play an important role in the surveillance of lesions. It is important to include patients’ age, comorbidities, life expectancy, personal preferences and risk tolerance into the considerations to treat or observe. Solid renal tumor with small cystic or necrotic components
When not to apply Bosniak:
The Bosniak classification should not be applied to lesions with an infectious, inflammatory or vascular etiology. Lesions with a solid component of > 25% are likely necrotic solid masses. These necrotic solid masses, as opposed to cystic masses, have a less indolent behavior. 
It is therefore important not to confuse indolent cystic cancer with more aggressive forms. Lesions with abundant thick nodular calcifications on CT can mask enhancement. In these lesions MRI with subtraction is advised to rule out enhancing soft tissue components. Hyperattenuating non-enhancing lesions larger than 3 cm and heterogeneous non-enhancing lesions on CT can also benefit from further evaluation with MRI to exclude enhancement before assigning a Bosniak category. case 1
CT of a solid lesion with smaller cystic/necrotic components. 
As more than 25% of the mass is composed of solid tissue this likely represents a necrotic mass in stead of a cystic lesion. 
Bosniak criteria should not be used. Solid renal tumor with cystic components case 2MRI of a more solid than cystic lesion in the right kidney. Renal abscess case 3There is a non-enhancing area in the left kidney on the T1W-image.
This area has low values in the ADC map in keeping with diffusion restriction. This proved to be an abscess.
Definitions:

Septa:
A septum is defined as a linear or curvilinear structure that connects two surfaces. Up to 3 septa are considered “few” and in keeping with a Bosniak II lesion.
4 or more septa are termed “many” and if enhancing are features of a 2F lesion (in the absence of more worrisome features) In the left diagram there are 2 septa connecting two surfaces (Bosniak II), and in the right diagram there are 5 different septa, defined as Bosniak IIF.
Enhancement:
Prior versions of the Bosniak classification divided enhancement between “perceived” and measurable, and all masses in which an area of enhancement could be measured could only be categorised as Bosniak III or IV. However, there was no evidence base for the distinction between perceived and measurable enhancement increasing risk of malignancy In the 2019 classification all enhancement is considered equal. 
Enhancement can be unequivocally perceived when comparing non-contrast and contrast-enhanced images performed using the same acquisition technique or ‘measurable’ using conventionally sized regions of interest” (not pixel values).
Specifically an increase of ≥20 HU on contrast-enhanced CT, or ≥15% signal intensity on contrast enhanced MR. If a feature is not unequivocally enhancing visibly and is too small to measure accurately then it is considered non-enhancing. ImageT2W coronal image of a cyst with many septa in the left kidney. On the T1W fatsat after contrast, these septa show obvious enhancement in comparison to the pre-contrast sequence. 
A cyst with many, thin septa is categorized as a Bosniak IIF
Septal and wall thickness:
Although there is still likely to be some inter observer variation in the measurement of enhancing septal and wall thickness, the new 2019 guidance provides values for thickness in each Bosniak category, replacing the prior descriptive classification of “minimally thickened” or “thickened”. A cyst with smooth thin enhancing wall ≤ 2mm thickness without septa is considered a Bosniak I cyst. A smooth ≤ 2mm enhancing wall with 1-3 septa ≤ 2mm thickness is Bosniak II A smooth and minimally thickened wall or septa (3mm) is considered Bosniak IIF Any smoothly thickened wall or septa ≥ 4mm is categorized as Bosniak III.
Wall irregularity and Nodularity:
The distinction between irregularity of enhancing wall or septa and a nodule relates to the angle formed with the associated wall or septum and the thickness. Enhancing areas which form acute angles with a wall or septum are considered nodules and are always categorized as Bosniak IV features. Enhancing areas which form obtuse margins with the septal or mural surface are considered thickening if ≤3mm. An enhancing area with obtuse margins is considered a nodule if ≥4mm when measured perpendicular to the underlying surface. If an area of obtuse angled thickening is present on both sides of a septum then the combined thickness on both sides of the septum should be measured, excluding the thickness of the underlying septum itself. This table summarizes the different measurements of the wall and septal thickness in the Bosniak classification.
Bosniak I:
On contrast CT Bosniak I cyst are well defined with a thin (≤2mm) smooth wall and contain homogenous, simple fluid (-9 – 20 HU) and no septa or calcifications. The wall may enhance. case 1

There is a typical Bosniak I cyst in the left kidney. The cyst has a well-defined thin smooth wall.
There are no septa or calcifications.
The content of the cyst is homogeneous and has a low HU. MRI characteristics of Bosniak I cysts are the same as on CT. 
The fluid within the cyst has a signal intensity similar to CSF. case 2
Right kidney with typical Bosniak I cyst on MR
Bosniak II:
In the 2019 version of the Bosniak classification more types of lesions can be characterized as Bosniak II (see table) in an attempt to increase specificity and to reduce the need to image or treat likely benign lesions.
Bosniak II lesion are now allowed to show enhancement, which is no longer a Bosniak III characteristic. Most incidental kidney lesions are detected on single phase portal venous studies. If these lesions are homogeneous and have a HU of 21-30, malignancy is highly unlikely and Bosniak II can be applied. Masses that are evaluated with a renal specific contrast protocol and have a HU of > 20 and show no enhancement are also assigned Bosniak II. All thin walled cystic masses with enhancing septa and/or any type of calcification can now be categorized as Bosniak II, as long as the septa are few (1-3) and thin (≤ 2mm). Homogeneous masses with Houndsfield units of -9-20 or ≥70 on non-contrast CT, as well as lesions -too small to characterize- but otherwise homogeneous and low-attenuating, can be placed in the Bosniak II category. Many masses are discovered incidentally on CT or MR examinations performed for other indications not using a dedicated renal imaging protocol. Despite this, many masses can be safely described as benign. Well defined homogeneous masses seen on non-contrast CT measuring between -9 to 20 HU or >70 HU are highly likely to be benign cysts and can be ignored. On contrast enhanced CT the adjacent enhancing renal parenchyma may increase measured density (pseudo enhancement) within benign cysts. Therefore, cystic masses measuring <30 HU in the portal venous phase are also considered benign. On unenhanced MR, well defined homogeneous masses which are hyperintense on T1 (around 2.5x normal parenchymal intensity) or well defined masses with T2 signal intensity similar to CSF are considered benign. Small masses may not be characterizable due to partial voluming if the slice thickness is more than half the diameter of the mass. In practice, pseudo enhancement can occur in masses up to 1.5cm in diameter and if these otherwise appear homogeneous they should be considered benign Bosniak II lesions. case 1Bosniak II cyst with only a few, thin, calcified septa. Bosniak II cyst case 2On the T2W-image a cyst with 3 smooth thin septa in the medial aspect of the right kidney (arrow).

The septa show no enhancement. According to the old classification this lesions would be classified as IIF.
In the updated 2019 classification non-enhancing septa cannot be counted as such, and the lesion is therefore downgraded to a Bosniak II cyst. This cyst had previously hemorrhaged and didn’t show any changes in follow-up over 5 years.

Pseudoenhancement can occur in masses up to 1.5 cm in diameter. If these lesions otherwise appear homogeneous, they should be considered benign Bosniak II lesions. ImagesLesion 1  (yellow arrow)A homogeneous, hypodense lesion is seen in the posterior right kidney. This lesion is too small to characterize and is classified as Bosniak II. Lesion 2  (white arrow)On the non-enhanced CT (NECT) there is a hyperdense lesion in the left kidney with HU > 70, which would normally correspond to a Bosniak II lesion (white arrow). A contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) in the portovenous phase shows no significant contrast uptake but there is aninhomogeneousappearance.
This requires additional imaging with MRI (see next images). MRI of the same patient. 
The lesion is hypointense on T2WI and  hyperintense on T1WI.
There is no contrast enhancement on the subtraction sequence.
On MRI the lesion could be confirmed as Bosniak II.
Bosniak IIF:
Not much has changed in the IIF category, besides that the criteria are now more well defined. Cystic IIF masses have either more than a few (≥4 ) thin (≤2mm) septa or few (1-3) minimally thickened (3 mm) septa both on CT and on MRI. Heterogeneous masses on CT without significant contrast enhancement should be considered as incompletely characterized. MRI is recommended to further asses these lesions before applying the Bosniak criteria. New in the IIF section are cystic masses that are heterogeneously hyperintense on unenhanced fat saturated T1W-imaging. 
This is the only mass type that is categorized greater than Bosniak II without enhancing features. The reasoning behind this is that papillary cancers can present with this finding. Progression over time is a strong indicator of malignancy, but is not included in the Bosniak classification. Enable Scroll

The lesion is classified as Bosniak IIF. case 2 There is a cystic mass in the right kidney with many (> 4) smooth thin enhancing septa. The lesion is classified as Bosniak IIF.
Bosniak III:
According to the previous criteria, Bosniak III masses are ‘indeterminate’ with about half of the resected masses being benign, resulting in potential harm of treatment without clinical benefit. In 2019 the criteria have been more clearly defined. Any cystic mass with one or more irregular septa or irregular enhancing wall of 3 mm or smooth thickened wall or septation of ≥4mm are considered Bosniak III. The term ‘irregular’ is defined as diffuse convex protrusions that have obtuse margins with the wall or septa (see section wall irregularity above). case 1 MRI of an exophytic cortical cyst in the left kidney with few, irregular thickened (3 mm) septa with obtuse margins which enhance after contrast, in keeping with findings of a Bosniak III cyst. It was decided to surgically remove the lesion and it proved to be a clear cell carcinoma.
Bosniak IV:
Cystic masses with Bosniak IV characteristics are highly likely to be malignant (90%) and present with larger soft tissue components and thick enhancing irregular walls. 
They are therefore more easily recognized as suspicious lesions. Nodules are defined as focal enhancing convex protrusions of any size with acute angles to the septa or wall or a protrusion of over 4 mm with obtuse margins with the wall or septa. Cystic masses with soft tissue components > 25% are no longer cystic masses but necrotic solid masses and the Bosniak criteria do no longer apply to these masses. case 1 The images show a complex large right renal cyst with T1 and T2 hyperintense internal fluid and T1 hyperintense debris, which shows mild enhancement on the subtraction image. This cyst also has an enhancing mural nodule (see arrow coronal images), classifying it as a Bosniak IV lesion. The kidney was removed and the cyst represented a papillary renal cell carcinoma case 2 The images show a cystic mass with a thick walled (< 4mm) cyst with a few irregular thickened septa. On the post contrast images there is no enhancement of the septa or wall but an enhancing mural nodule can clearly be identified (arrow). This therefore represents a Bosniak IV lesion. The lesion was excised and proved to be a clear-cell carcinoma. case 3 The axial and coronal T2 images show a cystic lesion within the lower pole of the left kidney with a thickened irregular wall. As less than 25% of the lesion is comprised of solid tissue, the lesion should be classified as a cystic mass instead of a cystic solid renal tumor. In the pre- and post-contrast coronal T1 fat suppressed images a wall thickness of more than 4 mm was measured (arrow). The lesion was classified as a Bosniak IV cystic mass.
The mass was excized and proved to be a clear cell carcinoma. case 4 Portovenous scan with an inhomogeneous cystic lesion in the left kidney.

Differential of Breast Calcifications:
Robin Smithuis and Ruud Pijnappel
Radiology department, Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp and Martini Ziekenhuis, Groningen, the Netherlands.:
Publicationdate 2008-05-11 - Update 2023-3-21 Ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) represents 25-30% of all reported breast cancers. Approximately 95% of all DCIS is diagnosed because of mammographically detected microcalcifications. In this review we will focus on: BIRADS classification Anatomy
Anatomy:
Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit
Terminal ductal lobular unit:
The basic functional unit in the breast is the lobule, also called the terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU). The TDLU consists of 10-100 acini, that drain into the terminal duct. The terminal duct drains into larger ducts and finally into the main duct of the lobe (or segment), that drains into the nipple. The breast contains 15-18 lobes, that each contain 20-40 lobules. The terminal ductal lobular unit is an important structure because most invasive cancers arise from the TDLU. It also is the site of origin of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ, fibroadenoma and fibrocystic disease, like cysts, apocine metaplasia, adenosis and epitheliosis. Most calcifications in the breast form either within the terminal ducts (intraductal calcifications) or within the acini (lobular calcifications). LEFT: Lobular calcifications: punctate, round or 'milk of calcium' RIGHT: Intraductal calcifications: pleomorph and form casts in a linear or branching distribution. Lobular calcifications These calcifications fill the acini, which are often dilated. This results in uniform, homogeneous and sharply outlined calcifications, that are often punctate or round. When the acini become very large, as in cystic hyperplasia, 'milk of calcium' may fill these cavities. However when there is more fibrosis, as in sclerosing adenosis, the calcifications are usually smaller and less uniform. In these cases it can be difficult to differentiate them from intraductal calcifications. Lobular calcifications usually have a diffuse or scattered distribution, since most of the breast is involved in the process that forms the calcifications. Lobular calcifications are almost always benign. Intraductal calcifications These calcifications are calcified cellular debris or secretions within the intraductal lumen. The uneven calcification of the cellular debris explains the fragmentation and irregular contours of the calcifications. These calcifications are extremely variable in size, density and form (i.e. pleomorphic from the Greek pleion 'more' and morphe 'form').
 Sometimes they form a complete cast of the ductal lumen. This explains why they often have a fine linear or branching form and distribution. Intraductal calcifications are suspicious of malignancy and are classified as BI-RADS 4 or 5.
Diagnostic Approach:
The diagnostic approach to breast calcifications is to analyze the morphology, distribution and sometimes change over time. The form or morphology of calcifications is the most important factor in deciding whether calcifications are typically benign or not. If not, they are either suspicious (intermediate concern) or of a high probability of malignancy. Usually biopsy in these cases is needed to determine the etiology of these calcifications.
Morphology:
The form of calcifications is the most important factor in the differentiation between benign and malignant. If calcifications cannot be readily identified as typically benign or as 'high probability of malignancy', they are termed of 'intermediate concern or suspicious'. If a specific etiology cannot be given, a description of the calcifications should include their morphology and distribution using the descriptions given in the BI-RADS atlas (1).
Distribution:
In the BI-RADS atlas the following descriptions are given for the distribution of calcifications (1) : Diffuse or scattered distribution is typically seen in benign entities. Even when clusters of calcifications are scattered throughout the breast, this favors a benign entity. Regional distribution according to the BI-RADS atlas would favor a non-ductal distribution (i.e. benignity), while Segmental distribution would favor a ductal distribution (i.e. malignancy). Sometimes this differentiation can be made, but in many cases the differentiation between 'regional' and 'segmental' is problematic, because it is not clear on a mammogram or MRI where the bounderies of a segment (or a lobe) exactly are. Clustered calcifications are both seen in benign and malignant disease and are of intermediate concern. When clusters are scattered througout the breast, this favors a benign entity. A single cluster of calcification favors a malignant entity. Linear distribution is typically seen when DCIS fills the entire duct and its branches with calcifications.
Change over time:
There are conflicting data concerning the value of absence of change over time. It is said that the absence of interval change in microcalcifications that are probably benign on the basis of morphologic criteria is a reassuring sign and an indication for continued mammographic follow-up (2). On the other hand in a retrospective study that included indeterminate and suspicious clusters of microcalcifications, stability could not be relied on as a reassuring sign of benignancy (3). In this group of patients with biopsy proven malignancy, 25% of patients had stable microcalcifications for 8-63 months. It seems that the morphology of calcifications is far more important than stability and stability can only be relied on if the calcifications have a probably benign form. In the same study it was shown that the odds for invasive carcinoma versus DCIS are statistically significantly higher among patients with increasing or new microcalcifications. The likelihood that carcinoma will be invasive increases significantly when a suspicious or indeterminate cluster of calcifications is new or increasing. On the left a patient with a few heterogeneous coarse calcifications. They were classified as BIRADS 3 (probably benign with a likelihood of malignancy less than 3%). At six month follow up they had increased in number and DCIS was found at biopsy.
Benign Calcifications:

Skin Calcifications - Tatoo sign:
Many calcifications can be classified as typically benign and need no follow up (i.e. BI-RADS 1 or 2). Many of these are skin calcifications. These are usually lucent-centered deposits. Atypical forms may be confirmed by tangential views to be in the skin. Usually they are located along the inframammary fold parasternally and in the axilla and areola. When you consider the possibility of dermal calcifications, always study the portion of the skin that is seen en face to look for similar calcifications (arrow). Tattoo sign in dermal calcifications Tatoo sign Skin calcifications may simulate parenchymal breast calcifications and may look like malignant-type calcifications. The cluster calcifications on the left was presented for biopsy. During the vacuum assisted biopsy procedure it was not possible to biopsy these calcifications, because they were out of range. When you look at the oblique and craniocaudal view, notice that the calcifications look exactly the same in configuration. This is called the tattoo sign . Spot views subsequently prooved that these were dermal calcifications. Click to enlarge Here another example of the tatoo-sign. First notice that there are some calcifications that are clearly located within the skin (arrows). The cluster calcifications on the MLO-view has the exact configuration as the cluster on the CC-view (next image). Click to enlarge On the CC-view the configuration of the microcalcifications is exactly the same. If these calcifications were located in the centre of the breast they should have a different configuration, because the projection is different. Only when calcifications are located within the skin their configuration stays the same.
Tatoo sign video:
Here two cases of skin calcifications presenting as tatoo sign (courtesy Roel Mus).
Vascular Calcifications:
These are linear or form parallel tracks, that are usually clearly associated with blood vessels. Vascular calcifications noted in women On the left typical vascular calcifications. If only one side of a vessel is calcified (arrow), the calcification may simulate intraductal calcification, but usually the diagnosis is straight forward.
Coarse or 'Popcorn-like':
The classic large 'popcorn-like' calcifications are produced by involuting fibroadenomas. These calcifications usually do not cause a diagnostic problem. When the calcifications in an fibroadenoma are small and numerous, they may resemble malignant-type calcifications and need a biopsy.
Large Rod-like, Plasma cell mastitis:
These are formed within ectatic ducts. These benign calcifications form continuous rods that may occasionally be branching. They are different from malignant-type fine branching calcifications, because they are usually > 1 mm in diameter. They may have lucent centers if the calcium is in the wall of the duct. These calcifications follow a ductal distribution, radiating toward the nipple and are usually bilateral. These secretory calcifications are most often seen in women older than 60 years. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate these from lineair calcifications as seen in DCIS.
Round and punctate calcifications:
Round calcifications are 0.5-1 mm in size and frequently form in the acini of the terminal duct lobular unit. When smaller than 0.5 mm, the term 'punctate' is used. Round and punctate calcifications can be seen in fibrocystic changes or adenosis, skin calcifications, skin talc and rarely in DCIS. Suspect DCIS when the calcifications are small, i.e. punctate , and show some heterogeneity especially when in cluster, linear or segmental distribution. Round and punctate calcifications are classified as:
Lucent-Centered:
These are round or oval calcifications that range from under 1 mm to over a centimeter. They are the result of fat necrosis, calcified debris in ducts, and occasional fibroadenomas.
Eggshell or Rim Calcifications:
These are very thin benign calcifications that appear as calcium is deposited on the surface of a sphere. These deposits are usually under 1 mm in thickness when viewed on edge. Although fat necrosis can produce these thin deposits, calcifications in the wall of cysts are the most common 'rim' calcifications. On the left a sharply defined lesion. The low density indicates the presence of fat. This is a typical oil cyst. On a follow up mamogram the wall has calcified resulting in eggshel calcifications.
Milk of Calcium:
These are benign sedimented calcifications in macro- or microcysts. On craniocaudad views they appear as fuzzy, round or amorphous. Consider magnification spot film with horizontal beam when you think of the possibility of milk of calcium, because on a 90? lateral view they may appear as semilunar, crescent shaped tea cups. LEFT: cluster of pleiomorphic calcifications on oblique viewRIGHT: milk of calcium (teacups) on lateral view with horizontal beam Many calcifications representing milk of calcium within microcysts however do not layer on horizontal beam radiographs. The most important feature of these calcifications is the apparent change in shape of the calcific particles on different mammographic projections (craniocaudal versus oblique or 90? lateral). The images show a different shape on the oblique view compared to the mediolateral view. On the mediolateral view there is layering of the calcium. Milk of calcium On the craniocaudal image the calcifications are round, fuzzy and ill-defined. On the mediolateral view the calcifications appear as semilunar, crescent shaped tea cups. Click on the image for an enlarged view.
Suture calcifications:
They represent calcium deposit on suture material. They are typically linear or tubular in appearance and knots are sometimes visible.
Dystrophic calcifications:
These are coarse irregular 'lava-shaped' calcifications. These calcifications are larger than 0.5 mm and often have a lucent center. They are seen in irradiated breast or following trauma. They develop 3-5 years after treatment in about 30% of women. These calcifications are also described as fat necrosis. It is important to differentiate them from a recurrent malignancy. On the left more extensive dystrophic calcifications.
Suspicious Calcifications:
If calcifications are not typically benign, they are either called 'Suspicious or of Intermediate Concern' or they are called 'High Probability of Malignancy'. We will first discuss suspicious calcifications. These calcifications have either an amorphous or coarse heterogeneous form. Usually these calcifications are biopsied to determine their exact nature.
Amorphous calcifications:
Amorphous or indistinct calcifications are defined as 'without a clearly defined shape or form'. These calcifications are usually so small or hazy in appearance, that a more specific morphologic classification cannot be determined. On the left amorphous and pleomorphic calcifications. Based on the morphology these calcifications were classified as BI-RADS 4. Biopsy revealed fibrocystic changes (FCC) Amorphous calcifications (2) Many benign and malignant breast diseases may present with amorphous calcifications (Table). About 20% of amorphous calcifications turn out to be malignant. Usually it is low grade DCIS. Amorphous calcifications (3) On the left amorphous calcifications within a denser area of the breast. This was classified as Bi-RADS 4 (3-95% chance of malignancy). Biopsy revealed DCIS with invasive ductal carcinoma.
Coarse Heterogeneous:
Coarse heterogeneous microcalcifications, formerly called coarse granular, are irregular, conspicuous calcifications that are generally larger than 0.5 mm. They are considered to be of intermediate concern, along with amorphous microcalcifications. They have to be differentiated from fine pleomorphic microcalcifications, formerly called fine granular, that vary in size and shape, are usually less than 0.5 mm in diameter and are considered to be of higher probability of malignancy, along with the fine linear microcalcifications (1). Coarse heterogeneous microcalcifications tend to coalesce but are not the size of the larger irregular dystrophic calcifications. On the left coarse heterogeneous calcifications They were classified as Bi-RADS 4. Biopsy revealed DCIS. Coarse heterogeneous calcifications in fibrous stroma The differential diagnosis of coarse heterogeneous calcifications includes: Multiplicity and bilaterality of such calcifications favors a benign etiology. DCIS is considered when these calcifications have a clustered, linear or segmental distribution. On the left a patient in whom new calcifications were detected during follow up for breastcancer in the contralateral breast. There are coarse heterogeneous calcifications in a segmented distribution. These calcifications were classified as Bi-RADS 4. Biopsy showed calcifications within fibrous stroma. There was no sign of malignancy.
High Probability of Malignancy:
Calcifications with a higher probability of malignancy are: Magnified view: fine pleomorphic calcifications in a linear distribution. Biopsy: High grade DCIS
Fine Pleomorphic:
These calcifications vary in size and shapes and are usually. 
They are more conspicuous than the amorphic calcifications. There is a 25-40% risk of malignancy. On the left fine pleomorphic calcifications in a segmental and linear distribution. These were classified as BI-RADS 4B. Biopsy revealed high grade DCIS. Fine pleomorphic calcifications in a segmental distribution in combination with an irregular mass (Bi-RADS 5) On the left a mammogram demonstrating two forms of calcifications. There are some round typically benign calcifications. The most conspicious calcifications however are the fine pleomorphic calcifications. They have a segmental distribution. In the presence of the mass these calcifications were classified as Bi-RADS 5. Biopsy demonstrated an extensive high grade DCIS with an invasive carcinoma. Amorphous and fine pleomorphic calcifications (Bi-RADS 4)Biopsy: fibrocystic changes The calcifications on the left were detected on the first mammogram in a screening program. There is a cluster of amorphous and fine pleomorphic calcifications. These calcifications were classified as BI-RADS 4B. A biopsy was performed and only fibrocystic changes were found. On the left a case that looks quite similar to the one above. New calcifications were detected during follow up in a screening program. These are fine pleomorphic calcifications in a cluster. These calcifications were classified as Bi-RADS 4. This proved to be DCIS. The message is that with these calcifications you cannot tell whether they are malignant or not and they have to be biopsied.
Fine Linear or Fine Linear Branching:
These are thin, linear or curvilinear irregular calcifications. They may be discontinuous. Usually they are
Their appearance suggests filling of the lumen of a duct, i.e. 'casting' calcifications. These calcifications are classified as Bi-RADS 4C. On the left calcifications in a segmental distribution. Some have a linear distribution and some have a branching morphology. This is highly suggestive of malignancy (Bi-RADS 4C). High grade DCIS On the left fine linear and branching calcifications in a segmental distribution highly suggestive of malignancy (Bi-RADS 4C). Extensive high grade DCIS was found at biopsy. High grade DCIS: Fine pleomorphic and fine linear calcifications in a linear distribution On the left a patient with new calcifications detected in a screening program. These are fine pleomorphic and fine linear calcifications. The distribution is linear. On the basis of the morphology and distribution these calcifications were classified as BI-RADS 4C. At biopsy this was high grade DCIS.

Academical Medical Center Amsterdam and Alrijne Hospital Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 29-3-2020 The role of CT in this COVID-19 pandemic still has to be determined.
CT can help to determine the severity of the disease and is a valuable and fast tool to determine whether a patient is infected by COVID-19 or not. This can help to keep patients with a high suspicion of COVID-19 infection separate from patients with other diseases, especially when the PCR-test is false negative. These cases are all patients that were admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 infection and all were PCR-tested. 
The findings at presentation and follow up is provided. In the description we use the CO-RADS classification. Press ctrl+for larger images and text on a PC or ⌘+ on a Mac.

Introduction:
The CO-RADS classification is a standardized reporting system for patients with suspected COVID-19 infection developed for a moderate to high prevalence setting. It is a preliminary classification of likelyhood of COVID-19 infection as proposed by the COVID working group of the Dutch Radiological Society. The interpretation of the CT findings has to be combined with the clinical symptoms and the duration of the symptoms as a CT can be negative in the first few days of a mild infection.
However most patients that we see have complaints for a week or more. At the moment most patients that are admitted to the hospital either have a CORADS 5, which means that they have a COVID-19 infection or they have a CORADS 1 or 2, which means no COVID-19 infection.

Coronary Artery Disease-Reporting and Data System 2.0:

Examples for the different Cad-Rads categories:
Csilla Celeng, Richard Takx, Robin Smithuis and Tim Leiner
University Medical Center Utrecht, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA and Alrijne hospital Leiden:
Publicationdate Update 2023-05-05 CAD-RADS is the Coronary Artery Disease-Reporting
and Data System.
CAD-RADS is developed to standardize reporting of coronary CTA, to improve communication and to guide therapy. 
The original article was published in 2016 by the
Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT), the American College of
Radiology (ACR) and the North American Society for Cardiovascular Imaging
(NASCI) and it has been endorsed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) (1). CAD
RADS 2.0
In
2022 CAD RADS was updated to version 2.0 (2).
Similar to the
original CAD-RADS version, stenosis severity determines the CAD-RADS score
(from 0 to 5).
New in the current version is the incorporation of plaque burden
(from P1 to P4) and an update of the modifiers.
Understanding Chest pain:
Cardiac chest pain can be categorized into stable angina, unstable angina, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (2,3). The latter three are called acute coronary syndromes.
Stable angina:
Stable angina is characterized by exertional chest pain induced by exercise, stress or emotion. 
It is a mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and supply due to the presence of atherosclerosis, microvascular dysfunction or spasm. 
This type of angina is relieved by rest or administration of nitroglycerin. 
Troponin-levels are normal.
Unstable angina:
Unstable angina pectoris (UAP) is defined as chest pain which occurs at rest or minimal exertion and is characterized by the absence of cardiomyocyte necrosis and normal troponin-levels (3). 
UAP is  caused by plaque rupture with thrombus formation causing partial occlusion of the affected vessel.
NSTEMI:
NSTEMI or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction is the result of plaque rupture and thrombus formation which causes partial occlusion and subendocardial infarction with elevated troponin-levels.
The ECG can be normal, or abnormal with inverted-T or ST-depression.
STEMI:
STEMI or ST-elevation myocardial infarction is characterized by complete occlusion of the lumen leading to a transmural infarction with elevated troponin-levels. 
The ECG is abnormal with ST-elevation or a hyperacute T-wave.
Target population for coronary CTA:
Pretest probability According to the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology non-invasive imaging (including CTA) can be used in all patients with a pre-test probability of >15% and can be considered in those with a pre-test probability between 5-15% (4). 
The pre-test probability is based on the age and gender of the patient combined with the type of complaints: typical angina, atypical angina or non-anginal chest pain (Table). Typical angina is: Atypical angina meets two of the before mentioned criteria.
Non-anginal chest pain lacks these criteria or meets only one.
CAD-RADS:

Assessment of stenosis degree:

Cad-Rads categories of the different coronary segments are based on the SCCT stenosis grading and coronary segmentation diagram (5).:
All coronary arteries >1.5 mm diameter are graded for stenosis severity and the clinically most relevant stenosis has to be documented. Cad-Rads 1 category also includes the presence of plaque with positive remodeling but no stenosis. Cad-Rads 4 category is divided into two subcategories: In patients with CAD-RADS 4A the next step can be ICA or functional assessment, i.e. CT-FFR, CTP, stress testing (exercise tolerance test, stress echocardiogram, SPECT, PET or cardiac MRI).
In patients with Cad-Rads 4B ICA is recommended. Click here to go to case 1 for an example of quantitative assessment of stenosis degree. The same assessment in this table. *SIS - Segment involvement score. SIS is a semiquantitative measure derived from the coronary CTA scan (7). For each of the 16 coronary segments a score of 1 is added if any plaque is present for a maximum of 16, or 17 in case a ramus intermedius is present.
P - Overall plaque burden sub-classification:
In CAD-RADS 2.0 overall plaque
burden has been added ranging from P1 (mild) to P4 (extensive). 
Plaque burden
should be listed after highest stenosis degree with addition of symbol /
(slash) (e.g. CAD-RADS 3/P2). Plaque burden should be determined
by the technique which is considered most appropriate at the local institution.
This includes calcium score or segment involvement score (SIS) or based on
visual assessment. 
Note that CAD-RADS 0 denotes absence of stenosis or plaque,
therefore P0 is not needed as a classification. Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) coronary segmentation diagram (15). Click to enlarge. This coronary segment diagram of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed
Tomography is used to indicate where the stenoses are located (6). LM: left main LAD: left anterior descending artery 
D1: diagonal 1 
D2: diagonal 2 LCX: circumflex artery
OM1: obtuse marginal 1
OM2: obtuse marginal 2
L-PDA: PDA from LCX
PLB: posterolateral branch; L-PLB: PLB from LCX. RCA: right
coronary artery PDA: posterior descending artery R-PDA: PDA from RCA PLB: posterolateral branch; R-PLB: PLB from RCA. Dashed lines represent the division between LM, LAD and LCX as well as the proximal, mid and distal segments of LAD, LCX and RCA.
Cad-Rads Modifiers:
In CAD RADS 1.0 there were four modifiers.
In CAD RADS 2.0 there are 6 modifiers that can be added to the Cad-Rads category: A modifier is named after the highest stenosis degree with the use of symbol / (slash).
For instance Cad-Rads 3/S. Example of a non-diagnostic scan. Both the RCA and LCX are blurred due to motion artifacts, resulting in CAD RADS N.
Modifier N - nondiagnostic:
If not all segments (>1.5 mm diameter) are diagnostic (e.g. motion
artifacts), modifier N should be listed. There are two ways of listing modifier
N: Overall plaque burden
should also be reported for non-diagnostic scans (N), if total coronary plaque
burden can be assessed reliably. 
In case of stenosis degree < 50% N should be
placed before category P (e.g. CAD RADS N/P2). 
If stenosis ≥ 50% then P should precede N (e.g. CAD RADS
3/P2/N).
Modifier HRP - high-risk plaque:
The term “vulnerable plaque” has been replaced by “high-risk plaque
features” as modifier “HRP”. High-risk plaque features include: low-attenuation plaque, positive remodeling,
spotty calcification and napkin-ring sign. If two or more of these
features are present modifier “HRP” should be added to the CAD-RADS category. There are three plaque types on coronary CTA: Calcified plaque is an atherosclerotic plaque in which the entire plaque appears as
calcium density (>130 HU on non-enhanced CT). The previous terminology “hard plaque” is not recommended. Partially calcified plaque is an atherosclerotic lesion with 2
components of which one is calcification. The previous term was “mixed plaque”, which is no longer recommended. Non-calcified plaque is a plaque without calcium content. The use of “soft-plaque”, “low-density plaque” and “fibrous plaque” should be
avoided (8). See also CTA features of stable and high risk plaques
Modifier I - ischemia:
CT-FFR (computed tomography fractional flow reserve) and stress CTP (computed tomography perfusion) are CTA derived non-invasive imaging techniques which allow to better define the hemodynamic significance of a stenosis ranging from 50 to 90% (CAD-RADS 3 and 4A).
CAD-RADS 2 lesions can be also considered if there is a proximal stenosis ≥ 40%, including the presence of high-risk plaque features. FFR-CT is a digital 3D model of simulated blood flow
in the coronary arteries. This figure shows a hemodynamically significant
stenosis in the LAD (0.58) and distal RCA (0.75). 
This means the presence of
ischemia; modifier I + should be used. In case of a mismatch between
CT-FFR or CTP and CCTA results, an ischemic segment without a concordant
anatomic lesion, should be classified as I- if the reader is confident that
this is a false-positive result by CT-FFR or CTP or I±
if it is indeterminate and there is questionable and discrepant interpretation. Please note that patients with
prior myocardial infarction and fixed perfusion defects without myocardial
ischemia on CTP should
be classified as I-. 
The presence of myocardial infarction should be documented
in the report. Stent in the mid LAD with minimal in-stent restenosis.
Modifier S - stent:
The presence of a stent is indicated by modifier “S”. Examples Note: the location of the stenosis does not matter, when using
CAD-RADS. What matters is that the patient has a severe stenosis and needs further
management. Please note: total coronary plaque burden should also be added and is
placed before the modifier S. Go to case 2 for an example of modifier S. A. example of LIMA-LAD without stenosis. B.example of SVG to posterior descending artery also with no stenosis in the graft. NB: there is a severe stenosis distal to the SVG, which is the bypassed stenosis and as of that is not considered for CAD-RADS classification.
Modifier G - graft:
The presence of coronary artery bypass grafts is indicated by modifier
“G”. Importantly, a bypassed stenosis is not considered for CAD-RADS stenosis classification. Examples: Note: the location of the stenosis does not matter, when using CAD-RADS. What matters is that the patient has an occlusion and needs further management. Please note: Total coronary plaque burden
(combined assessment of native coronary arteries and bypass grafts) should also
be added and is placed before the modifier G.
Modifier E - exceptions:
Modifier E is exceptions and non-atherosclerotic
abnormalities. The presence of non-atherosclerotic
abnormalities should be added as modifier “E” to CAD-RADS score.
Non-atherosclerotic luminal narrowing of the coronary arteries may require
disease-specific management or subspecialty referral. This image is of a patient with Kawasaki disease.
There is a coronary artery aneurysms (8 mm and 6 mm diameter)
of the LAD. Please also note the presence of
partially calcified plaque in the proximal aneurysm.
CTA features of stable and high risk plaque:
The morphology of high-risk plaques, which are thought to underly acute
coronary syndrome, differs from stable plaques. Stable plaques On histology, stable plaques are characterized by large calcifications,
fibrotic tissue and smaller lipid pools. High-risk plaques Conversely, unstable plaques can contain spotty calcifications, large-lipid
pool (necrotic core), which is covered by a thin fibrous cap. These
plaques are sometimes referred to as thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA). 
Some of
these high-risk plaque features can be identified by CTA. Low-attenuation plaque (HU=14) with severe (70-99%) stenosis in the LAD.
Low-attenuation plaque:
Lesions associated with plaque rupture frequently have a large lipid rich core. 
Lipid on CT appears as low attenuation. 
Plaques with < 30 HU on CTA were found to be present significantly more often in patients with acute coronary syndrome (9).
Positive remodeling:
Positive remodeling is defined as a compensatory outward enlargement of the vessel wall at the site of the atherosclerotic lesion with preservation of the coronary lumen (8). 
On histology plaques with positive remodeling show a higher lipid content and abundance of macrophages (9). 
Patients with positive remodeled plaques can present with an acute coronary syndrome without any prior cardiac history. An example of positive remodeling of a non-calcified plaque in the mid RCA. 
There is outward growth of the plaque with minimal stenosis of the lumen. Another example of positive remodeling of a calcified plaque in the proximal LAD. 
Again, the plaque is outward from the lumen causing no stenosis in the LAD. Spotty calcification in the LAD and D1.
Spotty calcification:
Spotty calcifications are usually defined as calcifications < 3
mm. 
Small spotty calcifications on CTA are associated with high-risk plaques (12). A: On the coronal image the so-called napkin-ring sign (dark area adjacent to the lumen, surrounded by a higher “ring-like” attenuation (white arrows). B: Tissue characterization on CT by HU number
Napkin-ring sign:
The Napkin-ring sign is a qualitative high-risk plaque feature
on CTA (13). It is defined as a central low-attenuation area adjacent to the coronary lumen
and a higher “ring-like” attenuation tissue surrounding this central area (14). On histology, the area of low-attenuation corresponds to the necrotic core,
while the “ring-like” outer area correlates with fibrous plaque tissue. The Napkin-ring sign is strongly associated with major adverse
cardiovascular events (15). Click here to go to case 3
Coronary CTA protocol:
Example of a CTA scan performed on the same scanner in the same patient without (A) and with (B) administration of nitroglycerin, showing the increased diameter of the LAD. Due to the vasodilatory effect nitroglycerine increases the number of assessable (>1.5 mm diameter) segments. Coronary CTA basics are:
Extra cardiac findings:
Of patients presenting with acute chest pain 5-10% suffer from STEMI,
15-20% from NSTEMI, 10% from UAP, 15% from other cardiac conditions and in the
remaining approximately 50% non-cardiac diseases are the underlying cause (4). Non-cardiac conditions include acute aortic syndrome (e.g. intramural hematoma,
penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, dissection or rupture), pulmonary embolism
(see arrows in figure), pericarditis, or other intra-thoracic pathologies. For these conditions the use of double or triple-rule-out CTA could provide an
alternative explanation for the symptoms. Image

overestimate the actual luminal stenosis. Continue with SPECT images of the same patient. Myocardial SPECT attenuation corrected (AC) images during stress showing no perfusion defect. A: apex to base; B: septum to lateral wall; C: inferior to anterior Shortly after the PCI the patient was again admitted with symptoms of
atypical angina. SPECT myocardial perfusion was performed to exclude the presence of ischemia,
which showed no perfusion defect in the left ventricle. The patient was treated with optimal medical care and no intervention was
performed. Cury RC, Leipsic J, Abbara S, Achenbach S, Berman D, Bittencourt M, et al. Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging. 2022;4(5):e220183.

Pulsatile and non-pulsatile tinnitus:
Ruud Becks, Sjoert Pegge and Anton Meijer
Department of radiology and nuclear medicine, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 12-6-2020 This article is based on a review by Pegge et al. describing a systematic approach for the diagnostic work-up of tinnitus [1]. 
The differential diagnosis is related to findings on different imaging modalities. 
A flowchart for choosing the appropriate imaging modality in pulsatile tinnitus is provided.
Introduction and flowchart:
Tinnitus is defined as an auditory perception of internal origin, and can have a significant influence on the wellbeing and performance in daily activities of affected subjects. In pulsatile tinnitus, the auditory perception is repetitively synchronous to the patient’s heartbeat. All other auditory perceptions are considered non-pulsatile. Less than 10% of patients presenting with tinnitus have pulsatile tinnitus. In about 70% of the cases with pulsatile tinnitus, an underlying cause can be identified by adequate diagnostic work-up as shown on the flow chart. Left sided vestibular schwannoma. Axial non contrast-enhanced T1-W (left) and contrast-enhanced images (right).
Non-pulsatile tinnitus:
Non-pulsatile tinnitus is almost always subjective.
Different underlying conditions relate to the development of non-pulsatile tinnitus, including cerumen impaction, middle ear infection, medications, noise-induced hearing loss, presbycusis or chronic bilateral hearing loss, hemorrhage, neurodegeneration, and spontaneous intracranial hypotension [2]. MRI is only recommended in patients with unilateral (non-pulsatile) tinnitus with focal neurological abnormalities, or asymmetric hearing loss [4]. The main purpose of diagnostic imaging is to identify or rule out a lesion in the cerebellopontine angle cistern, (e.g. vestibular schwannoma). 
Labyrinthine abnormalities can be identified on MRI supporting the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease [3].
Pulsatile tinnitus:
+++ Most optimal, ++ good, + moderate, ± indirect signs, – not suitable, LCH Langerhans cell histiocytosis, ICA internal carotid artery, FMD fibromuscular dysplasia
Pathology and imaging:
You can click on the table for a large view. For screening for underlying pathology and for the evaluation of a possible soft tissue mass or intracranial pathology, initial evaluation with MRI and MR angiography (MRA) is recommended with reported high diagnostic accuracy. For the evaluation of osseous pathology of the temporal bone, a limited scanning range of thin-sliced (submillimetric) CT is sufficient. Multi-detector CTA or CT venography (CTV) of the head and neck region can be performed for the evaluation of vascular pathology. Dynamic CTA, also referred to as 4D-CTA, is a technique that combines the non-invasive nature of CTA with the dynamic acquisition of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The role of conventional angiography (DSA) in the diagnostic work-up of pulsatile tinnitus has been minimized, and should be reserved for the indication to rule out vascular pathology in case MRI/MRA and CT/(4D-)CTA have not revealed the cause of pulsatile tinnitus. The role of duplex ultrasound in the diagnostic work-up of pulsatile tinnitus is limited, although duplex ultrasound is an effective screening tool for the evaluation of vessel wall pathology of the carotid arteries, e.g. stenosis and occlusion. 
During ultrasound, manual compression can be performed to investigate the influence of compression on tinnitus. Otosclerosis: hypoattenuated bone in the region of the fissula ante fenestram in fenestral otosclerosis (left). Cochlear otosclerosis appears as a hypoattenuated halo surrounding the cochlea on CT (right).
Temporal bone pathology:
Temporal bone pathology like otosclerosis, Paget disease, and LCH can cause pulsatile tinnitus. Otosclerosis
Is also known as otospongiosis, is an idiopathic infiltrative process of the petrous bone. 
It causes both sensorineural and conductive hearing loss, and can be the cause of pulsatile tinnitus. High-resolution, thin-sliced CT typically shows abnormal hypoattenuated bone in the region of the fissula ante fenestram in fenestral otosclerosis (left). Cochlear otosclerosis 
This appears as a hypoattenuated halo surrounding the cochlea on CT (right). Langerhans cell histiocytosis arising from the jugular foramen Langerhans cell histiocytosis 
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare benign disorder of clonal histiocyte proliferation.
Clinical symptoms in LCH depend on the extent of bone and extraskeletal involvement. Imaging typically reveals an aggressive lytic osseous lesion with associated soft tissue masses without surrounding sclerosis.
The image shows an aggressive lytic osseous lesion with soft tissue mass arising from the jugular foramen, which proved to be LCH.. Paraganglioma: soft tissue mass in the middle ear (left), strong enhancement of the lesion (right)
Paraganglioma:
Both CT and MRI can be used for the detection and evaluation of a paraganglioma. 
The majority of tympanic paragangliomas are located on the promontory as a small well-defined tympanic soft tissue mass. 
Usually, there is no or little surrounding bone erosion.
These small tumours are best evaluated using thin-sliced CT with a bone algorithm. Left Axial CT shows a soft tissue mass in the middle ear (arrows).
No visible bony erosion. 
Right Axial contrast enhanced T1-W with fat suppression demonstrates strong enhancement of this lesion(arrowhead). Meningioma
Hypervascular metastases or meningioma:
Highly vascularized bone lesions, like osseous hemangioma, basal meningioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or bone metastases, have been described as possible causes of pulsatile tinnitus. On the left a meningioma on MRI. 
Axial contrast-enhanced T1-W images. 
Enhancing mass located in the left cerebellar-pontine angle with extension into hypoglossal canal (arrow), jugular plate (encircled), and the middle ear (arrowhead).
Vascular channel dehiscence or variant:
Venous tinnitus is heard as a continuous murmur that exaggerates in systole. 
There seems to be an association with congenital variants such as a high riding, enlarged, or diverticulum of the jugular bulb, which can be best depicted on thin-sliced high-resolution CT. 
Prevalence of sigmoid sinus diverticulum and dehiscence has been reported to be significantly higher in pulsatile tinnitus than in the general population.
Aberrant course of ICA or stapedial artery:
An aberrant course of the internal carotid artery and persistence of the stapedial artery are congenital variants that need to be recognized on imaging studies.
An aberrant course of the internal carotid artery in the middle ear may mimic a soft tissue mass or paraganglioma at otoscopy. On the left an Aberrant course of the internal carotid artery (arrow) and persistence of the stapedial artery (arrowhead) on thin-sliced CT. 
Note the absence of the foramen spinosum (encircled).
Vascular loops, neurovascular conflict:
Vascular loops and elongated arteries are occasionally described as a possible cause of pulsatile tinnitus.
Considering the presence of these vascular loops and elongations also in asymptomatic patients, other possible causes of pulsatile tinnitus need to be ruled out in those subjects. Heavy T2 weighted CISS images on the left demonstrates a neurovascular conflict of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery with compression and displacement of the facial nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve (left image, black arrowhead). The right image shows a grade 3 (>50%) vascular loop of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery within the left internal acoustic canal (white arrow). AVF: abnormal early contrast filling of the sigmoid sinus (left), venous drainage of the sigmoid sinus into the jugular vein (right)
Arteriovenous fistula (AVF):
An AVF is an, usually acquired, abnormal connection between an artery and a vein without an intervening nidus. 
Located along the dura or within a dural sinus, these are called dural AVF. Dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) located in the right sigmoid sinus as identified by 4D-CTA and DSA. Left 4D-CTA lateral subtracted MIP demonstrating abnormal early contrast filling of the sigmoid sinus (white arrow) consistent with dAVF. 
Hypertrophic occipital artery identified as arterial feeder (black arrow). Right DSA, selective contrast injection of the external carotid artery showing a hypertrophic tortuous occipital artery (black arrows). 
Venous drainage of the sigmoid sinus into the jugular vein (white arrows). AVM located in the right temporal fossa
Arteriovenous malformation (AVM):
An AVM located in the head and neck region can be the cause of pulsatile tinnitus. Typically, an AVM develops in adolescence or young adulthood but can remain occult for a long period. T2-W (left) and phase-contrast MRA (right) demonstrating intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) located in the right temporal fossa. FMD with “string of beads” pattern on MIP CTA and DSA (black arrows)
Vessel wall pathology:
Vessel wall pathology like atherosclerosis, FMD or dissection can be a cause of pulsatile tinnitus. In the elderly population, atherosclerotic disease of the carotid or vertebral arteries is thought to be the most common cause of pulsatile tinnitus. 
In a significant stenosed or occluded artery, increased vascular flow on the contralateral side could lead to pulsatile tinnitus as a symptom. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a segmental nonatheromatous, non-inflammatory vascular disease of unknown etiology. 
Often it is a disease of the young leading to vascular stenosis and cerebral ischemia. On the left a classical imaging appearance of FMD the so-called “string of beads” pattern on MIP CTA and DSA (black arrows). Intracranial hypertension with enlarged Meckel cave (left image, white arrowheads), prominent subarachnoid space around the optic nerve (middle image, white arrow) and bilateral venous sinus stenosis (right image, black arrowheads)
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension:
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), which predominantly affects young obese women, may cause pulsatile tinnitus, although IIH is primarily characterized by symptoms of headache and blurred vision due to increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The exact pathophysiology of IIH is unknown but can develop in patients with a history of dural sinus thrombosis. Dural sinus stenosis or compression can also be observed in IHH. 
It is therefore advised to perform MRV or CTV in a patient with pulsatile tinnitus and suspicion of IIH. On the left a typical case of intracranial hypertension with enlarged Meckel cave (left image, white arrowheads), prominent subarachnoid space around the optic nerve (middle image, white arrow) and bilateral venous sinus stenosis (right image, black arrowheads).

Multiple Sclerosis 2.0:

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis:
Frederik Barkhof and Robin Smithuis
Amsterdam University Medical Center and University College London and Alrijne Hospital Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2021-12-01 This article is an updated version of the 2013 article and focusses on the role of MRI in the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. We will discuss the following subjects: There is an important role for MRI in the diagnosis of MS, since MRI can show multiple lesions - dissemination in space, many of which are clinically occult already at the time of first presentation, and MRI can show new lesions on follow up scans - dissemination in time, much earlier than new symptoms develop.
Introduction:
* In elderly patients or patients with cardiovascular risk factors it is better to look for at least 3 periventricular lesions
McDonald criteria:
More information:
Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2017 revisions of the McDonald criteria Multiple sclerosis is the most common inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in young and middle-age adults, but may also affect older people. According to the McDonald criteria for MS, the diagnosis requires objective evidence of lesions disseminated in time and space, either clinically or radiologically and elimination of more likely diagnoses. There is an important role for MRI in the diagnosis of MS, since MRI can show multiple lesions (dissemination in space), many of which are clinically occult already at the time of first presentation, and MRI can show new lesions on follow up scans (dissemination in time) much earlier than new symptoms develop. The McDonald criteria are very specific, because if you want to use MRI for the diagnosis of MS, you must confrim that the patient really has MS.
You do not want a patient to start treatment daily if there is any doubt about the diagnosis. Dissemination in Space For dissemination in space (DIS) lesions in two out of four typical areas of the CNS are required: Dissemination in time For dissemination in time (DIT) there are two possibilities: On the far left a new T2 hyperintense lesion on a follow-up examination 3 months after the first clinical event. The images on the right show a new enhancing lesion on a follow up scan. Click for larger view Typical locations of MS lesions
This is a coronal T2 image of a brain specimen with MS involvement. The lesions in the deep white matter (yellow arrow) are nonspecific and can be seen in many diseases. Typical for MS in this case is: An early diagnosis of MS allows treatment to start earlier and improves prognosis. 
This does carry the risk of a false positive diagnosis when MRI findings are misinterpreted.
MS phenotypes:
Relapsing-remitting (RR)A multiple sclerosis course characterised by relapses with stable neurological disability between episodes. 85% of cases, F>M. Secondary progressive (SP)65% of relapsing-remitting disease becomes secondary progressive. Primary progressive (PP)10-15%, M=F Atypical presentations
Marburg, Schilder, Balo, Devic, tumefactive MS (open-ring sign) Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)A monophasic clinical episode with patient-reported symptoms and objective findings reflecting a focal or multifocal inflammatory demyelinating event in the CNS, developing acutely or subacutely, with a duration of at least 24 h, with or without recovery, and in the absence of fever or infection. Radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS)MRI findings strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis in a patient with no neurological manifestations or other clear-cut explanation.
MR findings in MS:
The table summarizes typical MRI-findings in MS. Even when a patient is clinically suspected of MS, we still must study the WMLs carefully to decide whether these lesions are indeed suggestive of MS, and not incidental age-related findings. LEFT: involvement of U-fibers in MS. RIGHT: U-fibers are not involved in small vessel disease in a patient with hypertension.
Juxtacortical lesions:
Juxtacortical and cortical lesions are specific for MS.
They are adjacent to the cortex and must touch the cortex (yellow circle). In small vessel disease the U-fibers are typically spared and on T2 and FLAIR there will be a dark band of normal WM between the WML and the bright cortex (white circle). Do not use the word subcortical to describe this location, because that is a less specific term, indicating a larger area of white matter almost reaching the ventricles. Juxtacortical MS lesion located in the U-fiber. You really have to look hard to notice juxtacortical lesions  because they are difficult to differentiate from the hyperintense cortex. FLAIR or Double Inversion Recovery (DIR) can help identify them. The involvement of the U-fibers is best seen on the magnification view. LEFT: Typical Dawson finger with enhancement on T1WI. RIGHT: Multiple lesions and edema around enhancing lesion on T2WI.
Dawson fingers:
Typical findings for MS as seen in this case are: Dawson fingers are typical for MS.
They represent areas of demyelination along the small cerebral veins that run perpendicular to the ventricles.
If needed this can be demonstrated using SWI The enhancement will be present for about one month after the occurrence of a lesion. Symmetrical brainstem lesions in SVD (left) compared to typical asymmetrical MS lesions (right)
Brainstem lesions:
In MS brainstem lesions are typically peripheral. In small vessel disease there may be involvement of the brainstem, but it is usually symmetrical and central.
Temporal lobe involvement:
Temporal lobe involvement is also specific for MS. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the WMLs mostly found in the frontal and parietal lobes, uncommonly in the occipital lobes and not in the temporal lobes. Only in CADASIL there is early involvement of the temporal lobes. T1WI: enhancing lesions on baseline scan and new enhancing lesions on follow up 3 months later..
Enhancement:
Enhancement is another typical finding in MS. These are images of a patient who was re-examined 3 months after the first clinical attack. Typical findings for MS as seen in this case are: The edema around a new lesion will regress and finally only the center will remain as a hyperintense lesion on T2WI. The image shows a specimen with the perivenular inflammation in MS. MS starts as inflammation around these veins. In the first four weeks of the inflammation there is enhancement with gadolinium due to local interruption of the blood brain barrier. First there is homogeneous enhancement but this can change to (open) ring enhancement. Tumefactive MS. Arrow indicates biopsy site.
Tumefactive MS:
Tumefactive MS is a variant of Multiple Sclerosis. 
On MRI it presents as a large intra-parenchymal lesion with usually less mass effect than would be expected for its size.
They may show some peripheral enhancement, often with an incomplete ring unlike gliomas or intraparenchymal abscesses, which typically have a closed-ring enhancement. These T2W and T1W post-gadolinium images are of a 39-year-old male who presented with subacute onset of hemianopsia.
He was referred for biopsy to differentiate between a glioma or demyelination. There is an intraparenchymal mass in the right temporal and occital lobe with a hypointense rim on T2, which only partially enhances (open-ring sign) on the postcontrast images.
There is surrounding edema, but relatively little mass effect. This was a biopsy-proven demyelinating lesion.
The open-ring enhancement pattern with low signal T2 ring and low CBF are all indicative of demyelination.
Spinal cord lesions:
Typical spinal cord lesions in MS are relatively small and peripherally located.
They are most often found in the cervical cord and are usually less than 2 vertebral segments in length.
A spinal cord lesion together with a lesion in the cerebellum or brainstem is very suggestive of MS. Spinal cord lesions are uncommon in most other CNS diseases, with the exception of ADEM, sarcoid, and NMOSD. Proton-density-image of the spinal cord in a patient with MS The images show multiple short-segment lesions in the spinal cord. On PDW-images the spinal cord has a uniformly low signal intensity (like CSF), which gives the MS lesions a good contrast against the surrounding CSF and normal cord tissue. Use a 512 matrix and cardiac gating for optimal results.
A good alternative for PDW is STIR.
Make sure to have two different sequences or two different planes.
MS Differential diagnosis:
The differential diagnosis of MS is extremely large and includes almost all white matter diseases.
A broader differential diagnosis of white matter diseases is given here. In this chapter we will only deal with a limited number and there are some rules that we can follow. If a patient is clinically suspected of having MS and the MR-images support that diagnosis, then you should not consider other uncommon diseases. Conversely, it is not wise to put MS in the differential diagnosis if the clinician does not suspect the patient of having MS and on the MR incidental WMLs are found.
The odds are against the diagnosis of MS, because vascular WMLs are 50-500 times more likely than MS plaques. On the other hand if a patient is clinically suspected of having MS and multiple WMLs are found, our major concern is the differential diagnosis MS versus small vessel disease. Then the McDonald criteria are very helpful.
Prevalence and a priori chance:
When we look at the prevalence of the white matter diseases, you will notice that there are enormous differences. Hereditary diseases are extremely uncommon as individual diseases, but as a group they are not that uncommon, but still far more uncommon than MS. CNS involvement in Lyme disease is extremely rare. When incidental WMLs are found, these are usually the result of small vessel disease, since up to 50% of patients that get an MR examination for whatever reason, will have WMLs of vascular origin. They are more common in older people and in patients with vascular risk factors like atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, amyloid angiopathy, hyperhomocysteinemia, atrial fibrillation etc. * Temporal lobe involvement is seen in CADASIL
Small vessel disease:
The differences between small vessel disease and MS are summarized in the table. Typical for MS is involvement of corpus callosum, U-fibers, temporal lobes, brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord.
This pattern of involvement is uncommon in other diseases. Brainstem involvement in small vessel disease (left). Focal brainstem lesions in MS (right). Here we see typical differences in vascular brainstem lesions compared to MS (same images as above). The image on the left is an axial T2 weighted image illustrating typical vascular brainstem involvement, with a central involvement of the transverse pontine fibers. The image on the right is an axial T2 weighted image of the brainstem of an MS-patient, showing typical peripherally located white matter lesions, often in or near the trigeminal tract, or bordering the 4th ventricle. Here is a typical case of small vessel disease. There is widespread white matter disease with a symmetrical distribution and a lacune in the right basal ganglia. Patient with NMOSD showing a longitudinally extensive cord lesion with marked swelling. Bilateral neuritis optica. The diagnosis was confirmed by an AQP4-AB titer of 1:1024.
Neuromyelitis Optica:
A very important differential to keep in mind, especially in patients with a bilateral optic neuritis and myelitis, is Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), previously called Devic's Disease.
This is a demyelinating disease caused by antibodies against aquaporin or MOG in which the optic nerves and spinal cord are usually involved. Think of NMOSD when there is longitudinally extensive myelitis (LETM defined as more than 3 vertebral segments) with low T1-signal intensity and swelling of the cord.
On axial images the lesions often involve the central gray matter of the cord.
This is unlike MS, in which the lesions are usually smaller and peripherally located. Often there are a few T2-lesions in the brain. Read more on NMOSD in the spinal cord...
Balo's Concentric Sclerosis:
Balo's Concentric Sclerosis is an uncommon demyelinating disease. It is a progressive variant of multiple sclerosis characterized by alternative bands of demyelination and myelin preservation, with a laminated onion-skin configuration. The T2 and post-contrast T1W images show a large lesion in the left hemisphere with alternating T2-hyperintense and isointense bands. On the T1W images after gadolinium there is alternating linear enhancement.
Note that the outermost band shows diffusion restriction. There is a smaller, similar lesion on the right. ADEM extensive involvement of the cortical and gray matter - including thalamus.
ADEM:
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another important differential diagnosis of MS. This is a monophasic, immune-mediated demyelinating disease which often presents in children following an infection or vaccination. 
Many of the patients have MOG antibodies (MOG= Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein). On MRI there are often diffuse and relatively symmetrical lesions in the supra-and infratentorial white matter which may enhance simultaneously. There often is preferential involvement of the cortical gray matter and the deep gray matter of the basal ganglia and thalami. Here we have axial FLAIR and T2W-images of a young patient with ADEM - notice the extensive involvement of the cortical and gray matter, including the thalamus. Here another case of ADEM. Notice the involvement of the basal ganglia and the middle cerebral peduncle. Here another case of ADEM. Notice the similarity to the other two cases. The differences between ADEM and MS are summarized in the table. Natalizumab-associated PML. Images were kindly provided by Bénédicte Quivron CH Jolimont, La Louvière, Belgium
Natalizumab-associated PML:
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease caused by JC virus in immunosuppressed patients. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against α4-integrin approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis due to a positive effect on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome measures. A relatively rare but serious side effect of this drug is a higher risk of developing PML. The diagnosis of PML according to diagnostic criteria is based on the clinical presentation, the identification of JCV DNA in the CNS (e.g., in the cerebrospinal fluid) and imaging findings preferably on MRI. Compared to other PML populations such as HIV, the imaging findings in natalizumab-associated PML have been described as heterogeneous and fluctuating. Key imaging signs are: It can be difficult to differentiate progressive MS from natalizumab-associated PML.
See table for differences in imaging. How to image natalizumab-associated PML: Further information: www.MS-PML.org
Sarcoid:
Sarcoid has surpassed neurosyphilis as the great mimicker. The distribution of the lesions in this case is quite similar to MS.
Besides lesions in the deep WM, there are some juxtaventricular lesions and even Dawson finger-like lesions. The final diagnosis however was sarcoid. Another typical finding in this case is the linear enhancement (yellow arrow).
This is due to inflammation along the Virchow Robin spaces.
This is also a form of leptomeningeal enhancement. This explains why sarcoid has a similar distribution to MS: the Virchow Robin spaces follow the small penetrating veins, which are involved in MS. CADASIL
CADASIL:
CADASIL is short for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukencephalopathy. It is an inherited small vessel disease. Clinical clues: migraine, dementia and family history. Key finding: subcortical lacunar infarcts with small cystic lesions and leukoencephalopathy in young adults. Localizations of the WMLs in the anterior temporal pole and external capsule have a high specificity.
MRI protocol:

MS Brain Protocol:
Indications for MRI of the brain are (Reference: 2021 MAGNIMS–CMSC–NAIMS consensus recommendations on the use of MRI in patients with multiple sclerosis): Gadolinium is administered at the start of the examination because the longer you wait the more enhancement you will see on the T1W images (MS lesions are not spontaneously bright on T1-weighted images without contrast administration). The sagittal FLAIR is ideal for detection of lesions in the corpus callosum and the 3D sequence allows for better detection of smaller and juxtacortical lesions.
The T2W scan is preferably conventional SE or FSE. Finally the axial T1W-images are made after about 15 minutes to provide optimal contrast enhancement. * You may choose for dual contrast or dual plane images
MS Spinal cord Protocol:
Indications for MRI of the spinal cord are (Reference: Spinal cord involvement in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders): Gadolinium is less relevant when only the spinal cord is examined and is only administered when other diagnoses are considered (e.g. sarcoid) . The most sensitive sequence is the PD or STIR.
FLAIR should not be used in the spinal cord as it will only demonstrate 10% of the lesions. Click on image to enlarge.
MR timing in monitoring MS:
The table shows a scheme on how to follow-up a patient with MS based on the 2021 MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS consensus recommendations on the use of MRI in patients with multiple sclerosis. Consider the following modifications in the protocol: Less frequent MRI in further follow-ups in clinically stable patients treated with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate instead of every year while on treatment.

Majda Thurnher and Robin Smithuis
Department of Radiology of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria and Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2012-10-03 In this article we will focus on spinal cord diseases that are characterised by high signal within the cord on T2WI. The most common causes are inflammatory and demyelinating disorders like Multiple Sclerosis, Neuromyelitis Optica, Acute Disseminating Encephalomyelitis and Transverse myelitis. We will discuss the differential diagnosis including tumors, inflammatory and vascular disorders.
Introduction:
Spinal cord abnormalities. Common causes in white and uncommon causes in yellow.
Differential diagnosis:
The first question is usually  is it MS? 
Does it look like spinal cord MS and does the brain look like MS. If the patient has myelopathy and optic neuritis then also think of the possibility of Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) and do the NMO-IgG test. If both halves of the cord are involved than think of Transverse Myelitis (TM) which is not a specific diagnosis, but merely a reaction of the cord to various autoimmune and infectious stimuli.
2. Tumor The major differential of demyelinating diseases is an astrocytoma, especially if there is swelling and some enhancement of the cord and when the symptoms are more slowly progressive. The other common spinal cord tumors like ependymoma and hemangioblastoma do not cause differential diagnostic problems, because in most cases they just look like a tumor. Metastases to the cord are very uncommon.
3. Vascular Acute ischemia is typically seen as a complication of aortic aneurysm surgery or catheterisation. Cord ischemia due to venous hypertension or arterial steal can be seen in vascular malformations like AV-fistula. So always look for abnormal vessels around the cord.
4. Infammatory Vasculitis
5. Infection Infection rarely involves the spinal cord. If we exclude myelopathy due to cord compression as seen in trauma, degeneration and metastatic disease, which is usually not a diagnostic dilemma, then the most common diseases of the spinal cord are demyelinating diseases. MS is by far the most common demyelinating disease. The diagnosis can only be made if there is dissemination over time and space. Many patients who are diagnosed as having acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) or Transverse Myelitis, may have recurrent disease and later turn out to have MS (red arrow).
Systematic approach:
Whenever there is an abnormality in the spinal cord, we need a systematic approach to analyse the findings. Clinical findings can be helpful but can be quite similar in most spinal cord disorders. On MR look for the following: In MS there is typically a short segment involved, i.e. less than 2 segments. In other diseases like Transverse Myelitis, NMO and ischemia there is usually a long segment involved.
* How much of the cord is involved on tranverse images?
Partial involvement is typically seen in MS.
Complete involvement includes both halves of the cord and is typically seen in TM and NMO.
* Location of the involvement on transverse images?
Use high resolution transverse images to detect the location within the cord. Is it posterior like in MS, vitamin B12 deficiensy, lateral like in MS or anterior like in arterial infarction.
* Is the cord swollen? In TM and tumor the cord is swollen, while in MS and ADEM the cord is not swollen or less swollen then you would expect for the size of the lesion.
* Is there enhancement?
Many diseases show some enhancement, but the most important thing is that astrocytoma has to be included in the differential diagnosis.
Short or long segment involvement:

Transverse involvement:
Transverse images are very helpful in the differential diagnosis. You need high resolution images. Look for how much is involved (both halves or not), which part is involved and what is the form of the involvement. Brain abnormalities In many cases of myelopathy there will also be brain abnormalities and these can be a diagnostic clue to the diagnosis.
Multiple Sclerosis:
MS: short segment focal wedge-shaped involvement of the posterior column of the spinal cord with typical periventricular WM-lesions. key facts: MS is the most common demyelinating disease and there is overlap between these diseases. NMO was first thought to be a form of MS, but is now considered to be a distinct form. ADEM can relapse and progress to MS. The partial form of transverse myelitis Here we have images of a typical case. Many times the clinical history is very helpful like in this case. This 24-year old patient had visual disturbances on one eye followed by weakness and sensory disturbances of the lower and upper extremities a couple of years later. Now she presents with sensory disturbances of both lower extremities. So we already think MS. In the cord there are some well-defined lesions, but also some ill-defined foggy lesions. The transverse image shows the dorsal location and the typical triangular shape. Continue with the contrast-enhanced images On the contrast-enhanced images there is no enhancement. Active MS-lesions in the spine may enhance, but it is not that common as we see in active lesions in the brain. Whenever spinal lesions are encountered, it can be helpful to image the brain aswell. Now sometimes the patient is only sceduled for MRI of the spine and you don't have time to do a full brain examinations. In those cases consider to do only a sagittal FLAIR. Continue with the images of the brain. The MRI of the brain shows periventricular lesions and a lesion in the corpus callosum. These locations are very specific for MS. MS with non-specific findings in the spinal cord. In another patient there are non-specific lesions in the cord. Based on the examination of the spine alone, we have a broad differential diagnosis. However when we examine the brain, it becomes obvious that we are dealing with MS. Continue with the images of the brain. Typical MS in the brain In this case the findings in the brain are very helpful. The location of the lesions is very typical: pons, periventricular and subcortical. MS Now what can we expect in the spinal cord of patients with MS. It is like in the brain. Frequently the lesions are focal like we see on the left image. Less commonly there are diffuse abnormalities and then we have a tough differential diagnosis which will include TM and NMO. In long standing cases atrophy will be seen. One third of MS patients will have spinal symptoms. One third of patients have isolated spinal MS without any findings in the brain. However pathologic studies have shown that 95% of MS patients have spinal cord lesions, whether they have spinal symptoms or not. MS in the cord On transverse images MS lesions typically have a round or triangular shape and are located posteriorly or laterally. So can we exclude MS if a lesion is located anteriorly? Unfortunately not. MS is the great mimicker and can also be located anteriorly like in this patient who has a lesion in the typical location (blue arrow) but also a lesion ventrally in the cord (red arrow). This is uncommon, but you can not exclude MS. When MS lesions are active, they can enhance, but enhancement is not as common as in the brain. The enhancement patterns are non-specific. You can see ring enhancement, intense and less-intense enhancement. The less intense or vague enhancement is the most common pattern. Acute exacerbation of cerebral and spinal MS These are images of a patient with longstanding MS and acute exacerbation. There is enhancement in the active lesions. Continue with the images of the cervical spine. Acute exacerbation of cerebral and spinal MS Also in the spinal cord there are multiple lesions. On the transverse image a typical triangular shaped dorsal lesion is seen. Continue with the contrast-enhanced images. Acute exacerbation of cerebral and spinal MS Also in the spine there are multiple enhancing MS-lesions. Diffuse abnormalities in MS. Courtesy of Sundgren Pia, Lund, SE MS usually presents with focal abnormalities. Diffuse abnormalities that can look like transverse myelitis or extensive astrocytoma are sometimes seen. This pattern is more common in primary progressive and secondary progressive MS. Atrophy in longstanding MS Some say that spinal cord atrophy is specific for primary progressive MS (PPMS). The atrophy correlates very well with the clinical disability. It is more prominent in the upper part of the spinal cord. Duration of the disease is the most important determinant of cord atrophy.
Neuromyelitis Optica:
NMO presenting with neuritis optica (arrows). The brain is normal.Courtesy Andrea Rossi key facts: On the left images of a child who presented with unilateral neuritis optica. Images of the brain were otherwise normal. Continue with MRI of the spine. Patients who have one episode of optic neuritis or myelitis and who test positive for NMO-IgG are at high risk for developing the full spectrum of NMO. One month later this child presented with acute transverse myelopathy, i.e. bilateral symptoms. The images show abnormal signal in the spinal cord with swelling and some enhancement. An astrocytoma could very well present with these images, but given the history of an optic neuritis and the acute myelopathy, we do not think of a tumor. This proved to be NMO and the Ig-test for NMO was positive. In the original description of Devic's disease the optic neuritis and the myelopathy were simultaneously, but now we know that this is not always the case. Periventricular lesions in NMO around fourth and third ventricle. Brain lesions in NMO Previously it was thought that in NMO the brain was spared, but now we know, that brain lesions do occur. They are often distinct from those seen in MS. In Asia 60-80% of patients with NMO have brain abnormalities. In Europe only 25-40%. The location of the brain lesions in NMO is only around the ventricles. Periventricular lesions in NMO around third and lateral ventricles. The reason why these brain lesions are located around the ventricles is the following: The NMO IgG auto-antibodies are directed against Aquaporin-4 water-channels. So just like sodium- and potassium channels in the cells, there are also water-channels. The highest concentration of these Aquaporin-4 water-channels is seen around the ventricles. The images show abnormal signal around the third and frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Neuromyelitis optica with callosal lesions. Courtesy Dr Nakamura. Things become even more complicated, since it is also possible to have large lesions in the corpus callosum of patients with NMO as was described by Nakamura (6). So in any CNS disease with optic nerve and spinal cord involvement it is goos to do the test for NMO-IgG.
ADEM:
ADEM key facts: On the left images of a teenage child with a typical history: Eye movement disturbance and impairment in consciousness. This clinical history is typical for ADEM. Usually the brain is also involved. 30% of cases has spinal involvement. The imaging findings in this case are also typical. There is swelling and cord involvement like in TM and no enhancement. Continue with the images of the brain. ADEM First look at the images of the brain and decide what is different from MS-lesions. What is typical for ADEM and uncommon for MS is: ADEM - follow up The follow up MR shows that the cord has returned to normal again. On the left another case of ADEM. ADEM is typically seen in children. Again there is diffuse involvement of the spinal cord without enhancement and there is involvement of the brain. Typical ADEM. Courtesy of Andrea Rossi, Genova, IT Another case of ADEM. Notice the typical involvement of the pons and basal ganglia. Continue with follow up scan. Courtesy of Andrea Rossi, Genova, IT On follow up scan almost complete normalisation.
Transverse Myelitis (TM):
key facts: The sagittal image shows a large segment of hyperintensity on T2WI. The transverse image shows that most of the cord is involved. ATM on T2WI, CE-T1WI and STIR. These images are of a 31 year old male with headache, voiding disturbances, urinary retention, sensory level C3. The CSF analysis revealed 400/3 cells (meaning no infection) and a slightly higher protein level. The images show a long segment myelopathy with full transverse involvement. There is no swelling and no enhancement. It does not look like MS or tumor, so we are thinking ATM - acute transverse myelitis.
Diseases associated with Transverse Myelitis:
Transverse myelitis may occur in isolation or in the setting of another illness. When it occurs without apparent underlying cause, it is referred to as idiopathic. Idiopathic transverse myelitis is assumed to be the result of abnormal activation of the immune system against the spinal cord. The table provides a list of illnesses associated with TM (7). Patients with an acute short segment TM (or APTM) are at risk of developing MS if there is one of the following: In children with TM the expression is usually more severe. 60-90% are unable to move their legs.
However the outcome is usually better than in adults and in 30-50% there is complete recovery. Typical for TM is that on the initial MR the abnormalities are usually extensive and less or completely resolved on follow up scans. Longitudinal case series of TM reveal that approximately 1/3 of patients recover with little to no sequelae, 1/3 are left with moderate degree of permanent disability, and 1/3 have severe disabilities. Here images of a typical case of TM. There is multisegment high signal on STIR and T2WI with some swelling. Most of the cord in the transverse diameter is involved. There is no enhancement, which is usually the case in TM. Sometimes there is some patchy enhancement. Astrocytoma simulating Transverse myelitis When there is enhancement, it can be difficult to differentiate TM from an astrocytoma. On the left images of a 60 year old male with an astrocytoma. He presented with pain in the thoracic region and sensory disturbances in the left lower extremity followed by left hemiparesis. There is multisegment high signal on T2WI with some swelling, just like we have seen in cases of TM. On CE-T1WI there is a region of enhancement. The region of enhancement is more tumor-like, but the differentiation is difficult.
Spinal cord tumor:
Spinal astrocytoma
Astrocytoma:
As we have just seen, the major differential of the spinal cord diseases that we have discussed so far is an astrocytoma. Astrocytoma is a diffusely infiltrating tumor, that is not mass-like. Usually there is some patchy enhancement. On the left an astrocytoma in a 66 year old patient who presented with progressive sensory complaints. Biopsy revealed astrocytoma. Continue with the follow up. Spinal astrocytoma - follow up The patient was not operable and a follow up scan shows progressive disease. Multiple ependymomas The other two common spinal cord tumors are ependymoma and hemangioblastoma and they just look like a tumor. They present as enhancing masses and will not cause a differential problem. All other cord tumors are uncommon. The images are of a patient with neurofibromatosis who has multiple ependymomas. They present as multiple enhancing masses.
Vascular:

Arterial infarction:
Spinal cord ischemia is typically seen as a complication of aortic aneurysm surgery or stenting. The images are of a patient who developed a paraparesis after stenting of an aortic aneurysm. Notice the high signal ventrally in the chord, which is typical for arterial infarction. On transverse images a typical snake-eye appearance can be seen. DWI in spinal chord ischemia Aortic aneurysm stenting is the most common cause of spinal chord infarction. The diffusion images show restricted diffusion.
Vasculitis:
The images are of a child with headache, fever, hyperalgesia and numbness of the left side of the body. There is also abducens nerve palsy. The images are non-specific with multiple focal lesions and probably the first choise would be MS. The differential diagnosis would include inflammation, infection and metastases. In such cases always perform a transverse image of the spine to look for the exact location and perform a MRI of the brain. Continue. The lesions are located dorsally and one of the lesions is enhancing. Now if this was infection or metastases it would be strange that not all lesions enhance. MS is still on our list. Continue with the MR of the brain. Idiopathic Vasculitis On the CE-T1WI only one lesion shows enhancement. The location of the lesions and the enhancement could very well fit to the diagnosis of MS, but this proved to be vasculitis. Vasculitis can be idiopathic, but is also seen in SLE, Sj?gren and Behcet. Normally you think of vasculitis as a disease of the vessels in the brain, but all vasculitis can be seen in the spine as well. It produces MS-like images.
Spinal AVF:
The most common vascular malformation of the spinal cord is the dural AV-fistula. It consist of an abnormal connection between the artery and the veins , which can lead to increased venous pressure and predisposes the cord to ischemia and less commonly to hemorrhage. AVF's are mostly seen in the elderly population and are believed to be the result of trauma. An accurate diagnosis is important because these lesions may represent a reversible cause of myelopathy. Notice the high signal in the lower thoracic cord and the surrounding dilated vessels on the T2WI. On the enhanced T1WI there is subtle enhancement. Another case with myelopathy and dilated veins as a result of an AVF. Another patient with myelopathy and dilated vessels surrounding the cord. Notice the hypointense areas on the T2WI which represents hemorrhage. Another AVF with myelopathy and dilated vessels.
Cord compression:
Although beyond the scope of this article, the most common cause of myelopathy is cord compression as seen in trauma, metastatic disease and epidural hemorrhage. This patient has a fracture with posterior displacement. There is myelopathy due to traumatic cord compression. Another case of cord compression in a patient who was treated with anticoagulantia. There is myelopathy as a result of compression by a dorsally located epidural hemorrhage. The most common cause of cord compression is metastatic disease. Notice the abnormal signal in the vertebral body as a result of a metastasis which extends into the vertebral canal. by Andrea Rossi Neuroimaging Clinics of North America, Volume 18, Issue 1, Pages 149-161

Pathology of the Male Breast:
Publicationdate 2009-03-15 This review is based on a presentation given by Leonard Glassman and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. We will discuss: by Leonard M. Glassman
Normal Male Mammogram:
Normal male mammogram Click on image to enlarge When you do breast imaging in a male, always stick to the following rule:
 'If it is not normal, gynecomastia or classically benign,
 it needs a biopsy'. So, first we're going to give you a couple of examples of the normal male breast, just to get used to what normal looks like. Then we will discuss gynecomastia and finally discuss some specific tumors. Obviously, the lesions in this last category will need a biopsy, unless you are sure that it is classically benign, like for instance a lymph node or lipoma. On the left two examples of a normal male mammogram. The left image shows normal skin, a nipple and a small amount of connective tissue behind the nipple. The image on the right shows a bit more connective tissue, but this is still normal. Normal male mammogram On the left another normal male breast. There is more fatty tissue and there are a number of blood vessels. There is a small amount of fibrous connective tissue, but basically most of this breast is just fat. MR of the male breast T1WI with fat suppression On the left a MRI of the normal male breast. There is a small amount of connective tissue behind the nipple.
Gynecomastia:
Gynecomastia Gynecomastia is the most common abnormality in the male breast. Clinically, it presents as a soft mobile tender subareolar mass. Every word in this sentence is critical: 
soft - mobile - tender - subareolar . So it has to be soft and mobile. It is tender in the acute phase, but not in the chronic phase. Gynecomastia must be subareolar! Any mass that is not subareolar is not gynecomastia. Gynecomastia: nodular glandular pattern.Notice how it blends into the surrounding fat. Imaging pattern There are three imaging patterns: On the left a male breast with a nodular glandular pattern of gynecomastia. There is a fan shaped density radiating from the nipple. It may be more prominent in the upper outer quadrant and, more importantly, it blends into the surrounding fat. If you think about the mammogram on the left as the breast of a woman instead of a man, than you might say that there is an ill-defined mass and you might conclude that this is a malignancy . However, in a man this indistinct border is a sign of a gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is simultaneous proliferation of ducts and stroma without encapsulation, so it must blend into the surrounding fat tissue. There is no proliferation of lobuli, like there is in women. So you will not see tumors that start in the lobuli, for example lactating adenomas, fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumors, and also invasive lobular carcinomas are extremely rare. Left: gynecomastia in a young maleRight: Juvenile hypertrophy in an 8 year old female On the far left a mammogram of a male with gynecomastia and next to it a mammogram of an eight year old girl with juvenile hypertrophy. Notice that they look very much the same. Gynecomastia nodular pattern: Incidental finding on CT-scan On the left unilateral gynecomastia. This was an incidental finding on a CT-scan done for some other reason. By definition gynecomastia is 2 cm or more of subareolar tissue in a non obese male. It is a common 'normal' finding, that is seen in 55% of men at autopsy. The peak incidence is 60 - 69 years. It is significant if it is new or symptomatic. In elderly males gynecomastia makes up 65% of all breast lesions. 25% is carcinoma and 10% are other lesions. Mammogran and rotated ultrasound image
Nodular pattern:
The nodular pattern of gynecomastia is seen in the florid early phase. It begins as an increased number of ducts and epithelial proliferation with edema and cellular fibroblastic stroma. This phase is reversible. On the left a mammogram and an ultrasound image of a patient with a nodular glandular pattern of gynecomastia. Notice that it is situated underneath the nipple. The ultrasound image shows the typical appearance of gynecomastia: a hypoechoic mass with lobulation or even spiculation. If this was seen in a woman, you would say that this is a mass with microlobulation and spiculation, i.e. Birads IV or V. In a man this is typical for gynecomastia. On the left the same ultrasound image, but now in the normal position. Notice how 'malignant' it looks. Gynecomastia nodular pattern: T2W-fatsat and T1WI+Gd On the left a T2W-image with fatsat and a T1W-image after Gadolinium with fatsat. A radiologist who was not used to looking at 'male' mammograms ordered the MR for problem solving. Obviously this MR was performed for the wrong reason. MR should not be used to solve a problem that can be solved with mammography. Anyhow the MR shows gynecomastia of the nodular pattern. Dendritic pattern of gynecomastia
Dendritic Pattern:
The dendritic pattern is seen in the fibrotic or late phase. There are dilated ducts, moderate epithelial proliferation and fibrosis. On the left a mammogram showing a subareolar density with prominent extensions into the fat. Usually the density is smaller than in the nodular pattern. Classic benign chronic gynecomastia On the mammogram on the left we can imagine, that there is fibrosis with extension into the fat. This is different from the glandular edema-like appearance in the acute phase of gynecomastia. The ultrasound shows a spiculated appearance. These cases clearly demonstrate that gynecomastia can have an appearance which we would call malignant in a woman. Unfortunately some of the malignant lesions in a man can look benign and we will show some examples in the next chapter.
Diffuse glandular pattern:
This pattern is seen in males with very high estrogen levels. The images on the left simply look like small female breasts. This was a patient who was on estrogen therapy for prostate carcinoma. Pseudogynecomastia
Pseudogynecomastia:
This is usually bilateral and there is no palpable mass. Remember that gynecomastia presents clinically as a soft, mobile, tender, subareolar mass. Pseudogynecomastia results from excessive fat deposition in the breast area. It is seen as a normal variant, in obesity and in neurofibromatosis.
Benign Lesions:
Let's first start with a list of lesions that should not be diagnosed in male patients, because they simply do not get these lesions. A man does not get a lactating adenoma, because it is only seen in pregnancy. Because there are very few lobules in a man, lobular tumors are extremely rare. There are only a few invasive lobular carcinomas reported in men. Fibroepithelial lesions are also extremely rare because they too start in the lobules. So do not diagnose a fibroadenoma in a man, even if it looks like a fibroadenoma. When you get a biopsy result that says fibroadenoma, get another pathologist. On the left lesions that do occur in males. Exept for gynecomastia and pseudogynecomastia, in most of these lesions we will not get a diagnosis from imaging. We just report that there is a Birads IV lesion and do a biopsy. Myofibroblastoma
Myofibroblastoma:
Myofibroblastoma is an interesting lesion because it is the only one lesion that is more common in men than in women. It presents as a freely moveable, solitary, palpable, firm mass. There are no calcifications. The mean age is in the late 50's. On the left a large lesion, that looks like a fibroadenoma. Now we know that men do not get fibroadenomas. The pathology diagnosis was myofibroblastoma and the lesion was treated with local excision. Myofibroblastoma eccentric to the nipple in a patient with a little bit of gynecomastia bilaterally On the left another myofibroblastoma. It presents as a circumscribed lobulated mass without calcification.
Notice that the lesion is eccentric to the nipple.
It is the lobulated mass that needs to be biopsied, not the retromamillary gynecomastia. Myofibroblastoma eccentric to the nipple On the left another myofibroblastoma. The nipple is marked and the lesion is not retromamillary. On the ultrasound image the lesion is difficult to differentiate from the surrounding fat. Myofibroblastoma presenting as a circumscribed lobulated mass without calcification On the left another myofibroblastoma. Even if this lesion was located behind the nipple, you would not diagnose this as gynecomastia, because it is a lobulated mass. Granular Cell Tumor
Granular Cell Tumor:
This is a benign tumor of neural origin. They occur anywhere in the body. 6% occur in the breasts. They are typically seen in men in their 30's. Usually they present as circumscribed in males, but sometimes they have a spiculated appearance. Notice that the lesion on the left has a indistinct border as is usually seen in gynecomastia, but on the mammogram it is not located directly under the skin. So this is not gynecomastia and a biopsy is necessary. Granular Cell Tumor On the left another Granular cell tumor. Epidermal inclusion cyst
Epidermal inclusion cyst:
Epidermal inclusion cyst is a skin lesion.
It presents as a round well circumscribed dense mass. On the left a small epidermal inclusion cyst.
Notice how it raises the skin. Epidermal inclusion cyst On the left a large epidermal inclusion cyst. Epidermal inclusion cyst. T2WI with fat sat and pathology On the left a T2W image demonstrating the cystic nature and the pathology specimen. Granulomatous Mastitis
Granulomatous Mastitis:
Most are idiopathic. Specific causes must be excluded like TB, Sarcoid and fat necrosis. On the left is a male breast that looks like the breast of a female. These lesions can sometimes be spiculated. Varix
Varix:
On the left a lesion that looks like a cyst, but remember that cysts originate in the lobules and men do not have lobules, unless they take estrogen. This is a varix and if you puncture it, you get a big red surprise. Leiomyoma
Leiomyoma:
On the left a lesion, that looks like a fibroadenoma, but men do not get fibroadenomas. It is a solid encapsulated mass and at biopsy it happened to be a leiomyoma. If there are more than 2 mitoses per high power field the pathologist calls it a leiomyosarcoma.
Male Breast Cancer:
Invasive ductal carcinoma Malignant disease in men just looks like malignant disease in women. In the USA there are about 1700 new cases each year, which is 1% of all breast cancer. There is a higher incidence in people from China and Africa due to hyperestrogenism secondary to parasitic liver disease. These cancers present as a unilateral painless subareolar mass. This subareolar location is just like in gynecomastia, but usually it is eccentric to the nipple. It sometimes presents with bloody nipple discharge, which is unlike gynecomastia. Usually it is invasive ductal cancer. As stated above invasive lobular cancer is extremely rare. Also DCIS is rare because there is no screening program for men, so they will present when there is a palpable mass. On the left an eccentric irregular mass with spiculae. If this was a women you would have no trouble in diagnosing this as a cancer.
In a man it is the same. Invasive ductal carcinoma Male breast cancer presents as a round, oval or irregular mass. Calcifications are rare, but when they occur they are coarser than in women. On the left a small invasive ductal carcinoma. It is subareolar and central, but it is also encapsulated. This is not gynecomastia. Invasive ductal carcinoma Paget's disease of the nipple and skin ulceration are more common than in women. On the left an invasive ductal carcinoma with skin retraction. Invasive ductal carcinoma There is a long list of carcinoma risk factors and they are the same as in women: On the left a small eccentric encasulated invasive ductal carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma On the left a huge invasive ductal carcinoma with some coarse benign looking calcifications.
Other malignancies of the male breast:
Malignancies other than ductal carcinoma are uncommon. On the left a list of all malignancies in men.
Metastases:
Metastases from prostate cancer are the most common metastases in males. It results from hematogenous spread and is usually seen in patients with widespread disease. It presents as round or lobulated non-calcified masses. On the left a patient with two metastases of a small cell lung carcinoma. Liposarcoma
Liposarcoma:
A liposarcoma is a rare sarcoma. It presents as a slowly enlarging painful mass. It is usually of water-density and is not typically fatty. On the CT on the left you can see the density of the lesion that proved to be a liposarcoma.
Conclusion:

Gynecomastia versus Carcinoma:
In conclusion we can say, that male breast disease either presents as mass, pain or nipple discharge. Gynecomastia and invasive ductal cancer are the most common lesions in the male breast, but there are other rarer benign and malignant lesions. Gynecomastia and carcinoma can usually be differentiated, but biopsy is sometimes necessary to separate them. All lesions eccentric to the nipple need biopsy unless they are characteristically benign, i.e.contain fat or typical lymph node. On the left a list of characteristics of gynecomastia versus carcinoma. Notice that there are many similarities. Both gynecomastia and carcinoma occur mostly at the age of 60 and can be soft, mobile, subareolar and unilateral. So that does not help. Carcinoma is usually eccentric, while gynecomastia is never eccentric. Gynecomastia has to have extensions into the surroundig fat. Carcinoma sometimes may have spiculations, that can look the same. Actually we call it extension into the fat, if we think it is gynecomastia and spiculation, if we think it is a carcinoma. On the left two cases, that demonstrate, that it can be difficult to differentiate gynecomastia from carcinoma on a mammogram. The carcinoma on the right is a little bit more encapsulated than the gynecomastia on the right. In less than 10% of the cases a biopsy can be needed to make the differentiation. On the left two more cases. On the far left there is diffuse gynecomastia. On the right a huge cancer which is encapsulated. The last cases on the left look very similar to each other. Based on the mammogram these two can not be differentiated. In those rare instances a biopsy is needed.

Crohn's disease - role of MRI:
Carl Puylaert, Jeroen Tielbeek and Jaap Stoker
the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2016-02-17 In this article we will discuss the MRI-features used to evaluate Crohn's disease of the small bowel and the colon. A systematic approach is presented to grade disease activity resulting in a simple classification of mild, moderate and severe disease. This is sufficient for most therapeutic decisions.
Introduction:
Crohn's disease is characterized by inflammatory lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly in the terminal ileum and colon. The lesions are usually transmural, which can lead to complications like stenoses, fistulas and abscesses. While most patients first present with inflammation only, about two thirds of patients will develop complications within 10 years (1). There is no cure for Crohn's disease. Immunosuppressive drugs can decrease disease activity, maintain remission and prevent relapse. Eventually 90% of patients with ileocolic disease require surgery (2).
MRI protocol:
Bowel distention There are two techniques to acquire distension of the small bowel: We routinely perform MR enterography as it suffices in the large majority of patients while being less burdensome and more time efficient. Oral contrastFor oral contrast several options are available. We use a Mannitol in water solution (2%), which provides good contrast between lumen and bowel wall on both T1 and T2 sequences and is well accepted by patients. There is one precaution: no colonoscopy with electrocoagulation should be performed directly after the MRI because of methane resulting from Mannitol breakdown. MRI sequences We use the following sequences: Optional sequences:
Grading Crohn's disease activity:
Click for enlarged view There are several systems for grading disease activity in Crohn's disease. The scoring system, that we use, grades disease activity into none, mild, moderate and severe. It is based on the score of the bowel wall abnormalities and the presence of complications as presented in the table (3). Additional findings Other findings that should be mentioned in the radiology report are:
MRI signs of Crohn's disease:
Bowel wall thickening with deep ulceration (arrow) in the transverse colon.
Bowel wall thickness:
With adequate distension the normal bowel wall has a thickness of 1-3 mm. A common categorization is 3-5 mm for mild thickening, 5-7 mm for moderate thickening and > 7 mm for marked thickening of the bowel wall. T1 weighted post-contrast images or non fatsat T2 weighted images (if available) are preferable for measurement of bowel wall thickness. The image is a coronal post-contrast T1 weighted image showing disease activity in the transverse colon with marked wall thickening of more than 7 mm and deep ulceration (arrow). Balanced FFE image shows marked bowel wall thickening and luminal narrowing of the terminal ileum. Measurement on the balanced FFE sequence can be less accurate due to the black border artifact (arrows). Increased bowel wall thickness is one of the most common signs of inflammatory activity, but not specific for Crohn's disease. For more information on the differential diagnosis of bowel wall thickening click here. Bowel wall thickness correlates well with the severity of the disease activity. Measurements are best performed on the sequence with good luminal distension. Black border artifacts on balanced FFE sequences can distort thickness measurements.

Enhancement:
Abnormal bowel wall enhancement after administration of gadolinium is the result of increased vascular permeability and angiogenesis. It is seen both in active disease and fibrosis. Enhancement can be graded by comparing to the precontrast images, to normal bowel loops and nearby vascular structures. Pattern of enhancement Enhancement of the bowel wall can be categorized in one of the following patterns: The latter two enhancement patterns can only be appreciated when the wall is thickened. There is some discussion about the value of the enhancement pattern. A layered pattern is regarded to depict more severe disease activity compared to the mucosal pattern, which in turn is more severe than a homogeneous pattern (4). However, different degrees of inflammation and fibrosis can be present at the same time and a layered pattern of enhancement has also been associated with fibrosis (5), although a more recent study did not find this association (6). Homogeneous enhancementStrong homogeneous enhancement is seen in active inflammation. The image shows a terminal ileum with a homogeneous enhancement pattern with moderate (green arrow) and marked (red arrow) enhancement on an axial post-contrast T1 image. Mucosal enhancement pattern Mucosal enhancement This is seen as bowel wall thickening with increased enhancement of the mucosal layer relative to the outer layers. The image is a post-contrast T1 image with a mucosal enhancement pattern in the terminal ileum (arrow). There is relatively low enhancement of the middle and outer layers Layered enhancement pattern of the rectum with some surrounding fat stranding on an axial post-contrast T1 image (arrow). Continued inflammation with a homogeneous enhancement pattern can be seen in the sigmoid colon (green arrow). Also, a right-sided adnexal cyst is present with enhancing rim (arrowheads). Layered enhancement
pattern This pattern suggests severe disease activity or longstanding chronic disease (4,5). The three-layered appearance is caused by strong enhancement of the mucosa and the serosa with no enhancement of the middle layer, which is the submucosa and the muscular layer. This middle layer can consist of fat, edema or fibrotic tissue. This can be distinguished using a fat sat T2 sequence. Actively inflamed terminal ileum with marked thickening and moderate mural signal intensity (mural edema) on an axial T2 with fat sat.
T2 mural signal intensity:
Increased mural signal intensity on fat-saturated T2 images indicates the presence of mural edema, suggesting active disease. Presence of bowel wall thickening with a low mural T2 signal intensity is more suggestive of fibrotic disease. The psoas muscle can be used as a reference when assessing mural T2 signal. Fat suppression is routinely used to differentiate between mural fat depositions and mural edema. Fat depositions are the result of chronic bowel inflammation and therefore quite common in Crohn's disease. However, its presence does not indicate active disease. Perimural edema or fluid can be identified as well and is associated with active disease (7). Inflamed small bowel showing wall thickening and mild mural T2 signal (arrow) on an axial T2 with fat sat. Prestenotic dilatation can be seen proximally of the diseased segment. T2 mural signal intensity can be graded as follows using a T2 sequence with fat sat: Wall thickening of the terminal ileum in a 67-year-old male with Crohn's disease since 11 years. Layered enhancement is seen on an axial post-contrast T1 image with fat sat (left). T2 with fat sat (middle) shows the same pattern with a middle layer of low intensity. T2 without fat sat shows an increased signal in the middle layer, suggesting fat depositions. Endoscopy showed only superficial disease. Fat suppression is routinely used to differentiate between mural fat depositions and mural edema. Fat depositions are a result of chronic bowel inflammation, but not typical of active disease. These fat depositions can be diffuse but can also present as a layered pattern. The CT equivalent for this pattern is the 'fat-halo sign'. Coronal post-contrast T1 and T2 fat sat images show multiple small ulcerations in the terminal ileum.
Ulceration:
Moderate to deep ulceration can be seen on T1 and T2 images, but small ulcerations can be difficult to distinguish from mucosal folds depending on the degree of luminal distension. Ulcerations are active spots of inflammation and usually there is increased enhancement on the post-contrast T1 images.
Loss of haustration:
When the colon is involved in Crohn's disease a decrease of haustral folds can be seen. A complete loss of haustration results in a smooth surface. This is also a common finding in ulcerative colitis and known as 'lead pipe' colon. The coronal post-contrast T1 image shows loss of haustral folds throughout the colon in a patient with chronic Crohn's disease. Coronal post-contrast T1 image shows marked enhancement of the terminal ileum with a prominent comb sign.
Comb sign:
Increased vascularity of the mesentery is seen in active inflammation. The engorged vessels have a linear appearance, resembling the teeth of a hair comb (comb sign).
Creeping fat:
Creeping fat, also called fibrofatty proliferation or fat wrapping, are different names for hypertrophy of the subserosal fat. It is a common finding in longstanding Crohn's disease. The image shows creeping fat surrounding the descending colon. It isolates the colon from surrounding bowel loops.
Skip lesions:
Skip lesions and patchy inflammation are a typical finding in Crohn's disease, in contrast to the continuous inflammation, which is seen in ulcerative colitis. Skip lesions refers to the interspersed inflammation "skipping" parts of the bowel, which are left unaffected (green arrows). The coronal T1 post-contrast image (left) and the T2 image (right) show skip lesions in the terminal ileum. The affected lesions show increased enhancement with a layered pattern (yellow arrows), while another part is unaffected or skipped (green arrows).
Complications:
Coronal post-contrast T1 image with a stenosis at the ileocecal junction (left). No obvious pre-stenotic dilatation is seen. The stenosis was non-passable using endoscopy (right).
Stenosis:
Stenosis can present as bowel wall thickening combined with lumen narrowing. The presence of a prestenotic dilatation increases the likelihood of a stenosis. Abnormal contrast enhancement of the affected bowel segment is usually present. In the grading system, only severe stenosis is included as a complication, which is defined as a stenosis with prestenotic dilatation and a moderate-to-marked increase in mural T2 signal. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Narrowing can be due to contraction and therefore check other sequences before making the diagnosis of a stenosis. There may be a role for motility sequences to demonstrate the presence or absence of motility to differentiate a contraction from a stenosis. The video shows a motility sequence (BTFE dynamic) showing wall thickening in the cecum and terminal ileum. There is some decreased motility in the terminal ileum, but there is no stenosis.

In the sigmoid colon, a stenosis was seen, which could not be passed. MR-enterography was performed to examine the extension of the stenosis. Scroll through the images. The small bowel is normal, but stenotic segments are seen in the descending and transverse colon. Both stenotic segments display wall thickening up to 8 mm and marked enhancement with a mucosal pattern in the descending colon and a layered pattern in the transverse colon. A prestenotic dilatation is seen before both segments. Since these stenoses were not present at a colonoscopy before anti-TNF treatment, they had most likely developed during the treatment. Therefore it was decided to perform a subtotal colectomy with an ileosigmoïdal anastomosis. Post-contrast T1 image of a patient with a large infiltrate involving multiple small bowel loops.
Infiltrate:
Infiltrate can be seen as creeping fat between bowel loops with replacement of the fat signal intensity and tethering and kinking of bowel loops. Obstructive symptoms due to adhesions, inflammatory narrowing or fibrosis are common. Fistulas and abscesses are often present. Due to the complex structure, the exact path of a fistula can be difficult to define. Coronal Balanced FFE image shows an enterovesical fistula (arrow) originating from the small bowel. Post-contrast T1 image shows marked enhancement of the small bowel and the 'tram track' at the site of the fistula.
Fistula:
Sinus tracts and fistulas are common complications in patients with Crohn's disease. Both show marked enhancement on T1 images after administration of gadolinium. A fistulous track can present with a layered 'tram track' configuration or as a linear enhancing structure. It can be seen going from one bowel loop to another bowel loop, to another hollow organ or to the skin. Enable Scroll

Chest X-Ray - Heart Failure:
Simone Cremers, Jennifer Bradshaw and Freek Herfkens
Radiology department of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Dordrecht and the Medical Centre Alkmaar, the Netherlands, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2010-09-01 In this article we will discuss the radiographic signs of congestive heart failure on the chest X-ray.
Introduction:
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the result of insufficient output because of cardiac failure, high resistance in the circulation or fluid overload. Left ventricle (LV) failure is the most common and results in decreased cardiac output and increased pulmonary venous pressure. In the lungs LV failure will lead to dilatation of pulmonary vessels, leakage of fluid into the interstitium and the pleural space and finally into the alveoli resulting in pulmonary edema. Right ventricle (RV) failure is usually the result of long standing LV failure or pulmonary disease and causes increased systemic venous pressure resulting in edema in dependent tissues and abdominal viscera. In the illustration on the left some of the features, that can be seen on a chest-film in a patient with CHF. Increased pulmonary venous pressure is related to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and can be graded into stages, each with its own radiographic features on the chest film (Table). This grading system provides a logical sequence of signs in congestive heart failure. In daily clinical practice however some of these features are not seen in this sequence and sometimes may not be present at all. This can be seen in patients with chronic heart failure, mitral valve disease and in chronic obstructive lung disease.
Congestive Heart Failure:
Views of the upper lobe vessels of a patient in good condition (left) and during a period of CHF (right). Notice also the increased width of the vascular pedicle (red arrows).
Stage I - Redistribution:
In a normal chest film with the patient standing erect, the pulmonary vessels supplying the upper lung fields are smaller and fewer in number than those supplying the lung bases. The pulmonary vascular bed has a significant reserve capacity and recruitment may open previously non-perfused vessels and causes distension of already perfused vessels. This results in redistribution of pulmonary blood flow. First there is equalisation of blood flow and subsequently redistribution of flow from the lower to the upper lobes. The term redistribution applies to chest x-rays taken in full inspiration in the erect position. In daily clinical practice many chest films are taken in a supine or semi-erect position and the gravitational difference between the apex and the lung bases will be less. In the supine position, there will be equalisation of blood flow, which may give the false impression of redistribution. In these cases comparison with old fims can be helpful. Increased artery-to-bronchus ratio in CHF Artery-to-bronchus ratio Normally the vessels in the upper lobes are smaller than the accompanying bronchus with a ratio of 0.85 (3). At the level of the hilum they are equal and in the lower lobes the arteries are larger with a ratio of 1.35. When there is redistribution of pulmonary blood flow there will be an increased artery-to-bronchus ratio in the upper and middle lobes. This is best visible in the perihilar region. On the left a patient with cardiomegaly and redistribution. The upper lobe vessels have a diameter > 3 mm (normal 1-2 mm). Notice the increased artery-to-bronchus ratio at hilar level (arrows). LEFT: normal. RIGHT: CHF stage II with Kerley B-lines due to interstitial edema
Stage II - Interstitial edema:
Stage II of CHF is characterized by fluid leakage into the interlobular and peribronchial interstitium as a result of the increased pressure in the capillaries. When fluid leaks into the peripheral interlobular septa it is seen as Kerley B or septal lines. Kerley-B lines are seen as peripheral short 1-2 cm horizontal lines near the costophrenic angles. These lines run perpendicular to the pleura. Perihilar haze in interstitial stage of CHF When fluid leaks into the peribronchovascular interstitium it is seen as thickening of the bronchial walls (peribronchial cuffing) and as loss of definition of these vessels (perihilar haze). On the left a patient with congestive heart failure. There is an increase in the caliber of the pulmonary vessels and they have lost their definition because they are surrounded by edema. Previous normal chest x-ray (left) and CHF stage II with perihilar haze (right) On the left another patient with congestive heart failure. The lateral view nicely demonstrates the increased diameter of the pulmonary vessels and the hazy contours. Notice also the septal lines and the accentuated interstitium. Furthermore the fissura major is markedly thickened. Thickened septal lines due to interstitial edema in CHF CT will also demonstrate signs of congestive heart failure. On the image on the left notice the following: In a patient with a known malignancy lymphangitic carcinomatosis would be high in the differential diagnostic list. Ground glass opacity is the first presentation of alveolar edema and a precursor of consolidation. Enable Scroll

Stage III - Alveolar edema:
This stage is characterized by continued fluid leakage into the interstitium, which cannot be compensated by lymphatic drainage. This eventually leads to fluid leakage in the alveoli (alveolar edema) and to leakage into the pleural space (pleural effusion). The distribution of the alveolar edema can be influenced by: On the left a patient who was admitted with severe dyspnoe due to acute heart failure. The following signs indicate heart failure: alveolar edema with perihilar consolidations and air bronchograms (yellow arrows); pleural fluid (blue arrow); prominent azygos vein and increased width of the vascular pedicle (red arrow) and an enlarged cardiac silhouette (arrow heads). After treatment we can still see an enlarged cardiac silhouette, pleural fluid and redistribution of the pulmonary blood flow, but the edema has resolved. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll On the left another patient with alveolar edema at admission, which resolved after treatment. When you scroll through the images and go back and forth, you will notice the difference in vascular pedicle width and distribution of pulmonary flow. Both on the chest x-ray and on the CT the edema is gravity dependent and differences in density can be measured. Notice that even within each lobe there is a gravity dependent difference in density. This is only seen when the consolidations are the result of transudate like in CHF. This is not seen when the consolidations are the result of exsudate due to infection, blood due to hemorrhage or when there is a capillary leak like in ARDS. On the left a patient who first had a chest film in a supine position. Notice the pulmonary edema, which is almost exclusively seen in the right lung. A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be, that the patient had been lying on his right side for a while before the x-ray was taken.
Cardiothoracic ratio:
Old film for comparison (left) CHF with redistribution, interstitial edema and some pleural fluid The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) is the ratio of the transverse diameter of the heart to the internal diameter of the chest at its widest point just above the dome of the diaphragm as measured on a PA chest film. An increased cardiac silhouette is almost always the result of cardiomegaly, but occasionally it is due to pericardial effusion or even fat deposition. The heart size is considered too large when the CTR is > 50% on a PA chest x-ray. A CTR of > 50% has a sensitivity of 50% for CHF and a specificity of 75-80%. An increase in left ventricular volume of at least 66% is necessary before it is noticeable on a chest x-ray. On the left a patient with CHF. There is an increase in heart size compared to the old film. Other signs of CHF are visible, such as redistribution of pulmonary flow, interstitial edema and some pleural fluid. On a supine film the cardiac silhouette will be larger due to magnification and high position of the hemidiafragms. Exact measurements are not that helpful, but comparison to old supine films can be of value. Increased CTR due to pericardial effusion On the left a patient, who recently underwent a valve replacement. There is a large cardiac silhouette, which could be the result of cardiomegaly. Because of the recent cardiac surgery, the possibility of pericardial effusion was taken into account, which is nicely demonstrated on the CT-image. On the left another patient with a large cardiac silhouette on the chest x-ray due to pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion is demonstrated on the coronal CT-reconstruction.
Pleural effusion:
Pleural effusion more evident on lateral view Pleural effusion is bilateral in 70% of cases of CHF. When unilateral, it is slightly more often on the right side than on the left side. There has to be at least 175 ml of pleural fluid, before it will be visible on a PA image as a meniscus in the costophrenic angle. On a lateral image effusion of > 75 ml can be visible. If pleural effusion is seen on a supine chest film, it means that there is at least 500 ml present. On the left images of a patient who has bilateral pleural effusions. Notice that it is more evident on the lateral view. Subpulmonic pleural effusion with increased distance of the stomach air bubble to the lung base (arrow) Pleural effusion is not always visible as a meniscus in the costophrenic angle. A subpulmonic effusion may follow the contour of the diaphragm making it tricky to discern. In these cases, the only way to detect pleural effusion, is when you notice that there is an increased distance between the stomach bubble and the lung. The stomach is normally located directly under the diaphragm, so, on an erect PA radiograph, the stomach bubble should always appear in close proximity to the diaphragm and the lung. On the left images of a patient with signs of CHF. At first glance you might get the impression that there is a high position of the diaphragm. However when you notice the increased distance of the stomach air bubble to the lung base, you realize that there is a large amount of pleural fluid on both sides (arrow).
Vascular pedicle:
The vascular pedicle is bordered on the right by the superior vena cava and on the left by the left subclavian artery origin (6). The vascular pedicle is an indicator of the intravascular volume. A vascular pedicle width less than 60 mm on a PA chest radiograph is seen in 90% of normal chest x-rays. A vascular pedicle width of more than 85 mm is pathologic in 80% of cases. 5 mm increase in diameter corresponds to 1 liter increase of intravascular fluid. An increase in width of the vascular pedicle is accompanied by an increased width of the azygos vein. Subtle increased width of vascular pedicle (left) and normalisation (right) There are three principal varieties of pulmonary edema: cardiac,
overhydration and increased capillary permeability (ARDS). The vascular pedicle width (VPW) can help in differentiating these different forms of pulmonary edema (6): Normal VPW in a patient with ARDS On the left a patient with ARDS. There is alveolar edema in both lungs. Notice that the VPW is normal. The vessels in the upper lobes are not dilated and the cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll The VPW is best used as a measure to compare serial chest x-rays of the same patient, as there is a wide range of values for the VPW. The VPW may increase due to rotation to the right. On an AP-view the VPW will increase 20% compared to a PA-view. On the left a patient with subtle signs of congestive heart failure on the initial chest x-ray (image 1/2). There is a slightly enlarged vascular pedicle, which becomes more obvious when you compare to the chest film after diuretic therapy (image 2/2).
Dilatation of azygos vein:
Dilation of the azygos vein is a sign of increased right atrial pressure and is usually seen when there is also an increase in the width of the vascular pedicle. The diameter of the azygos vein varies according to the positioning. In the standing position a diameter > 7 mm is most likely abnormal and a diameter > 10 mm is definitely abnormal. In a supine patient > 15 mm is abnormal. An increase of 3 mm in comparison to previous films is suggestive of fluid overload. The difference of the azygos diameter on an inspiration film compared to an expiration film is only 1mm. This means that the diameter of the azygos is a valuable tool whether or not there is good inspiration.
Right ventricular failure:
Dilatation of IVC and hepatic veins on US images in a patient with RV failure RV failure is most commonly caused by longstanding LV failure, which increases the pulmonary venous pressure and leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension, thus overloading the RV. Other less common causes of RV failure are: Radiographic signs of RV failure: Sonographic signs of RV failure: The indication for ultrasound examination in many of these patients is abnormal liver function tests. It is therefore important to consider the possibility of RV failure when a patient presents with liver enzyme abnormalities. Under normal conditions dynamic ultrasound will demonstrate changes in caliber of the IVC. These changes in caliber can be attributed to variations in blood flow in the IVC in accordance with the respiratory and cardiac cycles. in Merck manual

Esophagus II: Strictures, Acute syndromes, Neoplasms and Vascular impressions:
Terrence C. Demos, MD, Harold V. Posniak, MD, Wayde Nagamine, MD and Mary Olson, MD
Department of Radiology of the Loyola University Medical Center, USA:
Publicationdate 2007-12-07 In Esophagus II we will discuss: Vascular impressions. Strictures
Strictures:
The table shows common and uncommon causes of esophageal strictures. To the far left is an image of a stricture (arrow) with irregular mucosal folds at stricture site on air-contrast view. This patient had Barrett's esophagus. Mid esophageal strictures and ulcers are suspicious for Barrett's esophagus. The two images on the right show a Barrett's esophagus with an irregular stricture due to adenocarcinoma. Here an image of a long, symmetric tapered benign stricture months after radiotherapy. Here are images of a patient with a benign stricture high in the esophagus (arrow). There is bilateral lower lobe lung consolidation due to repeated aspiration. Approximately 5,000-15,000 cases of caustic ingestion occur in the US every year. About 50%-80% occur in the pediatric population. On the left a high stricture (arrow) following caustic ingestion Osteophytes (arrow) can impinge on the esophagus and hypopharynx. However they rarely cause symptoms. Multiple structures are uncommon. The table shows diseases that may present with multiple esophageal strictures. Benign pemphigoid Here is an image of a patient with benign pemphigoid. Mucosal bullae have led to multiple strictures (arrows). Epidermolysis bullosa This image is of a patient with benign epidermolysis bullosa. Multiple strictures (arrows) are a residual of mucosal bullous disease. Extensive bullous skin disease has led to webbed fingers and contractions. Corrosive ingestion Corrosive ingestion can result in multiple strictures.
Acute esophageal syndromes:
In the table on the left are etiologies of an acute esophageal syndrome.
Boerhaave syndrome:
Boerhaave syndrome is rupture of the esophageal wall. It is most often caused by excessive vomiting in eating disorders such as bulimia although it may rarely occur in extremely forceful coughing or other situations, such as obstruction by food. Boerhaave syndrome is a transmural or full-thickness perforation of the esophagus, distinct from Mallory-Weiss syndrome, a nontransmural esophageal tear also associated with vomiting. These syndromes are distinct from iatrogenic perforation, which accounts for 85-90% of cases of esophageal rupture, typically as a complication of an endoscopic procedure, feeding tube, or unrelated surgery. This image is of a patient with Boerhaave syndrome. Chest radiographs show pneumomediastinum (arrows). Esophagram with extravasated water soluble contrast material in left hemithorax (asterisk) Perforation is almost always on the left side of distal esophagus. Radiographs show mediastinal gas, effusion, and later pneumothorax. Esophagram is used to confirm leak, first with water-soluble contrast, then barium if no leak is demonstrated. Boerhaave's syndrome On the left a patient with Boerhaave syndrome. The barium study shows extraluminal gas (arrow) without contrast extravasation. CT shows extraluminal gas (arrows). Rent of distal left esophagus confirmed at surgery. CT can show small amounts of extraluminal gas or extravasation not visible on radiographs or esophagram.
Mallory-Weiss tear:
A Mallory-Weiss tear results from prolonged and forceful vomiting, coughing or convulsions. Typically the mucous membrane at the junction of the esophagus and the stomach develops lacerations which bleed, evident by bright red blood in vomitus, or bloody stools. It may occur as a result of excessive alcohol ingestion. This is an acute condition which usually resolves within 10 days without special treatment. Mallory-Weiss tear On the left a patient with a Mallory-Weiss tear. Spot films show barium (arrows) in linear mucosal tear near gastroesophageal junction. Tears may be in distal esophagus, gastric fundus, or extend across the GE junction.
Esophageal hematoma:
These unusual lesions have been associated with increased esophageal
intraluminal pressure, most often vomiting, instrumentation, and anticoagulation
or bleeding disorders. Some are spontaneous. Blunt trauma is a rare cause. Hematomas are self-limited and almost never progress to perforation. Most esophageal hematomas resolve in 1-2 weeks with conservative treatment. On the left a patient with an esophagus hematoma. He presented with chest pain and dysphagia after vomiting. Aside from tortuous aorta chest radiograph is normal. The barium study shows a narrowed lumen (arrows) on AP view and flattened lumen on lateral view (arrowheads) suggestive of a intramural hematoma. On CT the diagnosis of an intramural hematoma was confirmed. A high density mural hematoma (arrowhead) is seen next to NG tube (arrow). Following conservative treatment, six months later the barium study was normal. On the left a patient who had a complicated endoscopy. Instrumentation caused a mucosal tear and dissecting intramural hematoma resulting in double lumen with separating stripe of mucosa (arrows). On the far left an intramural extravasation (arrow) after distal dilation for achalasia. In the middle an intramural extravasation (arrow) after complicated endoscopy. On the right a perforation after biopsy with extravasation of contrast material (arrow).
Benign neoplasms:
Here a list of benign esophageal masses. Esophageal leiomyoma
Leiomyomas:
Leiomyomas are the most common benign esophageal neoplasm and are often large yet nonobstructive. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are least common in the esophagus. On the left an asymptomatic patient with a leiomyoma. On the chest film an abnormal opacity is seen behind the heart (arrow). The barium study demonstrates a lobulated mass (arrow) that does not obstruct despite its large size. Esophageal leiomyoma Mucosal lesions are indicated by mucosal irregularities. Submucosal intramural lesions produce smooth filling defects, and in profile, the margins often form close to a right angle with the esophageal wall. Extrinsic lesions tend to form longer obtuse angles if not fixed to the esophageal wall, and their epicenter may be outside the esophagus. In practice, the location of a lesion may be difficult to determine. On radiograph, tumor (arrows) protrudes into azygoesophageal recess. On esophagram, the inferior margin of this intramural lesion forms close to a right angle (arrow) with esophageal wall. Calcified esophageal leiomyoma A calcified esophageal mass is almost always a leiomyoma. On the left a patient with a calcified esophageal lesion (arrows) protrudes into azygoesophageal recess on radiograph. Lesion (arrow) on CT and surgical specimen radiograph showing calcification. On the left a patient with granular cell myoblastomas, an uncommon benign tumor. These two lesions (arrows) are nonspecific in appearance, but the proximal lesion does demonstrate overhanging and right angle margins indicating mural location. Pedunculated fibrovascular polyps
Fibrovascular polyp:
Pedunculated fibrovascular polyps are rare lesions, that are difficult to diagnose on esophagrams. Their movement during the examination produces an inconstant position. Their shape may be suggestive as in this patient. The stalk is often difficult to identify.
Duplication:
On the left a patient with an esophageal duplication. The findings on the barium study are non-specific. Lesion (arrows) is visible behind the heart on radiograph. Esophageal narrowing (arrows) is caused by duplication. A foregut duplication cyst is a congenital cyst. In the case on the left it displaces hypopharynx and opacified esophagus (arrow) posteriorly and trachea and larynx (asterisk) anteriorly.
Malignant neoplasms:
Here a list of malignant esophageal masses. Early and small esophageal carcinoma are not synonymous. Early esophageal carcinoma is limited to the mucosa, submucosa with no lymph node metastases. Most are small ( Small esophageal carcinoma is defined by the size of the lesion, a diameter So an early carcinoma may be small, but a small carcinoma may be invasive or metastatic and thus not an early carcinoma. This image is of a patient with an early esophageal carcinoma. Lesion is not visible on single contrast esophagram. Air-contrast esophagram shows surface irregularity (arrows) indicating a mucosal lesion. This was both a small lesion and a pathologically early squamous carcinoma. LEFT: Small polypoid carcinoma. RIGHT: Large polypoid lesion. Advanced carcinoma has many gross appearances: On the left two cases of polypoid carcinoma. Esophageal carcinoma with ulcerations (arrows) and sharp right angle junction with esophageal wall (arrowheads) This image is of a patient with an infiltrative ulcerated carcinoma. This lesion has an abrupt transition forming an acute angle and overhanging edge. This indicates mural involvement and is different than obtuse angles usually produced by extrinsic lesions that are not fixed to the esophagus. Varicoid carcinoma These images are of a patient with a varicoid carcinoma. Unchanging appearance of filling defects indicate tumor rather than varices. Note sharp upper margin of lesion and ulceration (arrows) LEFT: Varicoid carcinoma. RIGHT: Superficial spreading carcinoma. To the far left an image of a patient with a varicoid carcinoma. Long lobulations simulate varices but did not vary during fluoroscopy. Note large irregular folds and soft tissue mass (arrow) of gastric fundus Next to it an image of a patient with a superficial spreading carcinoma. Extensive superficial spread involves distal esophagus. This appearance can be seen with both early and advanced lesions. LEFT: Long irregular distal stricture due to carcinomaRIGHT: Distal narrowing is not tapered and more proximal than achalasia. Irregularity (arrow) at narrowed site is subtle but persistent On the far left a patient with a carcinoma with stricture. An irregular, asymmetric stricture is highly suggestive of carcinoma. Smoothly tapered, symmetric strictures are characteristic of a benign etiology, but malignant strictures can have similar characteristics and mimic benign lesions. Next to it a patient with a carcinoma with stricture resembling achalasia. Distal esophageal malignancy may closely resemble achalasia. If esophageal motility is normal, achalasia can be excluded. If abnormal, however, subtle imaging features; asymmetric, irregular, abrupt, or high narrowing, mucosal abnormality, or fixed abnormality suggest diagnosis. On the left another case of pseudoachalasia. Distal narrowing simulates achalasia, but narrowing is eccentric, shoulders are asymmetric (arrows), and the mucosa is irregular at the tip of narrowing. CT shows gastric fundus thickening (arrows) due to adenocarcinoma. Tracheoesophageal stripe Width of the juxtaposed posterior tracheal and anterior esophageal walls > 5 mm on a lateral chest radiograph is suspicious for pathology, most often esophageal carcinoma or achalasia. On the left a patient with a widened 1 cm stripe (arrows). Esophagram shows widened stripe (arrows) and irregular margins of midesophageal carcinoma. CT shows abnormal soft tissue dorsal to trachea. The tumor invades mediastinum adjacent to aortic arch (arrow) Barrett's esophagus with ulcerated (arrow) adenocarcinoma
Barrett's esophagus and Adenocarcinoma:
Barrett's esophagus is a proven risk factor for the development of an adenocarcinoma. The incidence of cancer in Barrett's however is controversial. Who, how, and when individuals should be screened is unresolved. Adenocarcinoma was 10% of esophageal malignancies in 1960s. Since 1960s, incidence increasing in USA greater than any other carcinoma. Incidence now approaching or exceeding squamous carcinoma in Caucasian men in the USA and Europe. On the left a patient with an ulcerated (arrow) plaque like adenocarcinoma in a Barrett's esophagus. Primary gastric fundus adenocarcinoma can invade the esophagus, but means of differentiating invasion from a primary esophageal tumor are a subject of debate. On the left a patient with a gastric fundus adenocarcinoma. The barium study demonstrates marked irregular thickening of distal esophagus and folds at gastroesophageal junction. CT shows thickened irregular lesser curvature wall (arrows) near gastroesophageal junction. Spindle cell carcinoma Spindle cell carcinomas are rare neoplasms, also called carcinosarcomas. They are often bulky but nonobstructive as in the case on the left. Leiomyosarcomas and rare primary melanomas of the esophagus also tend to be bulky but do not cause significant obstruction. Leiomyosarcoma of the esophagus On the left a patient with a leiomyosarcoma of the esophagus. Margin (arrows) of bulky lesion visible on chest radiograph. Lateral view of esophagram shows marked irregularity and esophageal narrowing (arrows). Leiomyosarcoma of the esophagus On the left another patient with a leiomyosarcoma of the esophagus. Large lesion distorts esophageal lumen. CT shows lesion distorting but not obstructing esophageal lumen (arrow). Esophageal obstruction due to metastatic mediastinal lymphnodes. On the left three patients with esophageal narrowing as a result of metastatic mediastinal lymphnodes. On the far left a bronchogenic carcinoma. Extrinsic mediastinal lymph nodes produce long obtuse angles at the interface with esophagus. In the middle another bronchogenic carcinoma. Irregular distal esophageal wall due to invasion of esophagus. In the right a patient with a breast carcinoma. There is mediastinal lymphadenopathy with esophageal invasion and obstruction. LEFT: normal esophagusRIGHT: Mediastinal nodes (arrows) displace esophagus to right Due not confuse normal esophageal irregularities for impressions by lymphnodes. On the left a normal esophagus. The esophagus (arrow) protrudes under aortic arch into right side of AP window. Next to it mediastinal nodes (arrows) that displace the esophagus to right in a patient with bronchogenic carcinoma.
Vascular impressions:
On the left a list of vascular structures that may cause impressions on the esophagus. Uphill varices in a patient with cirrhosis.
Uphill varices:
With portal hypertension, elevated portal venous pressure leads to reversed (hepatofugal) flow bypassing the liver through the left gastric vein to dilated esophageal and periesophageal veins that anastamose with the azygos and hemiazygos veins which drain uphill into the superior vena cava. Filling defects due to varices are characterized by change in appearance during the examination related to breath holding and thoracic pressure. On the left are CT images of a patient with large Uphill varices secondary to cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Large mediastinal and esophageal (arrows) varices On the left CT images of a patient with uphill varices. LEFT: Retrocardiac mass-like varices (arrow). RIGHT: Esophagram showing varices (arrows) Uphill varices can be mass-like as seen in the case on the left. Continue with next image. Mediastinal varices (blue arrows) and esophageal varices (red arrow) The CT shows mass-like mediastinal and esophageal varices (arrows). Varicoid carcinoma Varices have to be differentiated from varicoid carcinoma. On the left the fixed appearance of filling defects indicates tumor rather than varices. Note sharp upper margin of lesion (arrows) Downhill varices in a patient with a superior vena cava obstruction Downhill Varices With superior vena caval obstruction, upper body venous blood flows caudally downhill through esophageal veins to the azygos vein which empties into the superior vena cava caudal to the obstruction. If the obstruction is at or below the azygos, the blood flow extends further caudally to the portal system and then the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava and the right atrium. On the left downhill varices in a patient with a superior vena cava obstruction due to histoplasmosis. On the barium study inconstant filling defects (arrows) represent downhill varices in upper esophagus. The angiogram demonstrates collateral vessels including a dilated left superior intercostal vein (arrow). Downhill varices in a patient with a superior vena cava obstruction The barium study demonstrates inconstant filling defects (blue arrows) due to downhill varices in upper esophagus. CT demonstrates esophageal (red arrow) and mediastinal varices. Continue with venogram. Upper arm venograms show SVC obstruction. Aberrant right subclavian artery
Aberrant right subclavian artery:
This is the most common thoracic arterial anomaly and rarely causes symptoms. The artery extends up and to the right producing a dorsal diagonal impression on the esophagus (arrows). The CT demonstrates that the aberrant artery (arrow) is last vessel from arch and extends dorsal to trachea and esophagus. Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery
Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery:
A right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery is most often an incidental finding. A right aortic arch with mirror-image branching however is almost always associated with congenital heart disease. CT shows right arch (R) and aberrant left subclavian artery (arrow) arising low off arch and extending to left dorsal to esophagus and trachea. On the left the esophagram of a patient with a right arch that produces a dorsal indentation on this lateral view (blue arrow). The diagram shows the aberrant left subclavian artery (L SCA) dorsal to the trachea and esophagus. Double ArchLEFT: Right and left arch indent esophagus (arrows) at different levels RIGHT: Angiogram with double arch in asymptomatic 65-year-old
Double Arch:
Double arch most often presents with airway obstruction, dysphagia, aspiration in children. The arches indent esophagus at different levels. Double Arch On the left another double arch. Chest radiograph with right lung consolidation due to aspiration in 6-year-old. Right and left arch indent esophagus (arrows) at different levels Aberrant left pulmonary artery: aberrant artery extends between trachea and esophagus indenting both (arrows)
Aberrant left pulmonary artery:
The aberrant left pulmonary artery indents the trachea dorsally and esophagus ventrally as it extends between them. Narrowing of right bronchus can cause air trapping or atelectasis. Tortuous aorta A tortous descending aorta is a common cause of extrinsic impression on the esophagus. The image on the far left shows a narrowed distal esophagus. Oblique view shows esophageal indentation by aorta with obtuse margins (arrows) characteristic of extrinsic compression. Normal and abnormal aortic arch impression on the esophagus Aortic pathology On the far left the normal aortic arch impression on the esophagus. This impression can be enlarged if there is dilatation of the aorta as seen in this patient with a mycotic aortic arch aneurysm (arrows). Coarctation: 'Reverse figure 3' indention of esophagus
Coarctation:
On the left 3 images of a patient with a coarctation. On the chest film the 'Figure 3' shape of aortic knob due pre and post stenotic dilatation (arrows). The barium study demonstrates the 'Reverse 3 figure' indention of esophagus by pre and post stenotic aortic dilatation (arrows).

Neck Masses in Children.:
Annemieke Littooij, Cécile Ravesloot and Erik Beek
Radiology department of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2016-11-01 A mass in the neck is a common finding in children. In this article we present a pictorial essay of neck masses in children and provide a diagnostic approach based on the location of the lesion and whether it is cystic or solid. Ultrasound is the imaging method of choice and in many cases a definite diagnosis is possible, especially if the lesion is cystic. MRI is of value in large lesions, to determine whether the lesion infiltrates into deep spaces. CT is sometimes applied in acutely ill patients with infections to assess whether an abscess is present. In suspected malignant lymphoma ultrasound can demonstrate which node is most accessible to image guided biopsy or excision, while PET/CT is used for staging.
Introduction:

Diagnostic approach:
In a neck lesion in a child, ultrasound can usually determine whether a lesion is cystic or solid. Often more than one lymph node is enlarged. Try to differentiate between reactive nodes, lymphadenitis due to TB or cat-scratch disease and malignant lymphoma.
* Solid - not a lymph nodeIf a solid lesion is not a lymph node look for a possible site of origin, like the salivary gland, the thyroid gland or the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Subcutaneous solid lesions sometimes have a typical appearance, like pilomatrixomas, lipomas or hemangiomas. In many cases however a solid lesion will be non-specific and a diagnosis can only be made through biopsy or excision. Click on image to enlarge
Location of cystic lesions:
Once you have decided that the lesion is cystic its location will often point to its nature (figure). Midline lesions Midline lesions are either thyroglossal duct cysts, dermoid cysts or ranulas. Older children can be asked to protrude their tongue. A thyroglossal duct cyst will move upward with the hyoid bone. Ranulas have a typical location in the floor of the mouth. Off-midline lesions Off-midline lesions can be branchial cleft cysts or lymphangiomas. Branchial cleft cysts often contain debris. Anteriorly located lymphangiomas are often multicystic. In the posterior neck they are often single.
Cystic lesions:
Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. In neck lesions we first try to figure out whether a lesion is cystic or solid. In clear cystic lesions this is straightforward. It can however be a problem if the cyst has been inflamed or when a cyst has bled, since children often present with a preexistent lesion that has bled. Try to elicit swirling of the contents by compressive movements of the probe or by changing the position of the child and look for acoustic enhancement. The video shows a swelling, that appeared overnight in a 13-year-old girl. A hypo-echoic lesion is seen superficial to the carotid artery and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. No movement of the lesions content was seen when pinged with the probe. When the girl was asked to sit upright the contents swirled.
Thyroglossal duct cyst:
Thyroglossal duct cysts are common lesions in children. The thyroglossal duct runs from the base of tongue at the foramen caecum to the thyroid gland. The embryonic thyroid gland travels through the duct to reach its final normal position. Normally, the thyroglossal duct then involutes, but when the duct persists, a thyroglossal duct cyst can develop anywhere along this tract (figure). Thyroglossal duct cysts move upward if the tongue is protruded or during swallowing (see next movie). Ultrasound is usually sufficient to make the diagnosis. Always look for the presence of a normal thyroid gland and make an image of it. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. This videoclip demonstrates the upward movement of the thyroglossal duct cyst together with the hyoid bone during swallowing. Thyroglossal duct cyst Thyroglossal duct cysts can be anechoic or hypo-echoic with internal echoes, due to infection, hemorrhage, or proteinaceous content. The majority of thyroglossal duct cysts is located within 2 cm of the midline. Here a tranverse image of a hypoechoic thyroglossal duct cyst with some internal echoes located in the midline. Thyroglossal duct cyst Here a tranverse image of an anechoic thyroglossal duct cyst just left of the midline. Typical hyper-echoic dermoid cyst in the suprasternal notch.
Dermoid cyst:
Dermoid cysts are inclusion cysts, that contain epithelium and skin adnexa like hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands. 7% of dermoid cysts occur in the head and neck region, especially around the orbit and in the midline of the neck, with a predilection for the suprasternal notch. Here a typical homogeneous hyper-echoic oval lesion, representing a dermoid cyst, which was located in its favorite location, the suprasternal notch. Dermoid cyst In the neck dermoid cysts are generally homogeneously hyperechoic, although they can be inhomogeneous. The differentiation from a thyroglossal duct cyst can be difficult if the dermoid cyst is located near the hyoid bone. The content of thyroglossal duct cysts is usually hypo-echoic and may contain internal echoes, while dermoid cysts generally have a more homogeneous hyper-echoic content. Here an unusual inhomogeneous appearance of a dermoid cyst in front of the thyroid gland (figure). Orbital dermoid cyst The most common location of a dermoid cyst in the head-neck region is around the orbit, typically at the upper outer corner. On ultrasound they are anechoic and one should look for the presence of a bony lining. If the integrity of the bony lining is uncertain, a CT or MRI is necessary to determine possible intracranial extension. Here a typical orbital dermoid cyst. It was firm on palpation and located at the lateral border of the orbit. On ultrasound it is anechoic with remodelling of the underlying bone.
Branchial cleft cyst:
Most branchial cysts are remnants of the second brancial cleft. Cysts at the level of the thyroid gland can be remnants of the third or fourth branchial cleft. Incomplete obliteration results in either a cyst (75%), a sinus or a fistula (25%). Cysts present as painless masses, sometimes appearing suddenly after internal hemorrhage. They are located along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lateral to the common carotid artery, and if more cranially between the internal and external carotid artery. Sometimes a beak sign may be seen as a curved rim of the lesion pointing medially between the internal and external carotid. Typical ultrasound appearance of a branchial cleft cyst with echogenic debris. On ultrasound they often contains internal echoes caused by debris, which consists of cholesterol crystals. The cyst is usually compressible, which results in movement of the content. This may not be the case in a cyst with a fresh internal hemorrhage. They can inflame and present with an empyema. Here another branchial cyst with a typical location superficial to the carotid artery bifurcation. Branchial sinuses Branchial sinuses are blind ending tracts, presenting anterior of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Branchial second arch fistulas end in the tonsillar fossa, as can be demonstrated with a contrast fistulogram or MRI. With ultrasound a tract can often be seen to travel upwards, but it is usually not possible to depict the proximal ending. Here a two-year-old boy with a dirty spot in the right lower neck. A small tract could be seen to extend inwards. At operation a second branchial fistula was excised. Here a ten-year-old girl with a pit in the right neck, anterior of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. On US a long cystic lesion can be seen which can be traced up to the right submandibular region. At operation, the fistula extended towards the right tonsillar fossa and was excised.
Lymphangioma:
Lymphangiomas are cystic lesions, caused by maldevelopment of the lymph channels. The majority occur in young children, with 90% in the head and neck region. In the posterior neck a lymphangioma usually has one or more larger cysts. In the anterior neck a lymphangioma can consist of innumerable small cysts, and may infiltrate deeply into the neck or mediastinum. This is also called a hygroma colli. The sonographic appearance depends on the size and number of cysts. Larger cysts are mostly anechoic or may contain some debris. A microcystic lymphangioma can be hyper-echoic due to the high number of closely related reflecting walls. Here an ultrasound of a typical lymphangioma. MRI was performed because the extension of the lesion was not clear. Here the T2-weighted image of the same patient. On T1-weighted images the content has a variable signal intensity, depending on its protein or blood content. It generally has a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Contrast enhanced T1 can show enhancement of the wall. Here an ultrasound image of a six-year-old girl with a sudden swelling in the left neck. There were several small anechoic cysts and one large cyst containing internal echoes, which were probably the result of a bleeding in a preexistent lymphangioma. A 3-year-old boy presented suddenly with a supraclavicular mass. Ultrasound showed a lesion with echogenic debris. A hemorrhage in a preexisting lymphangioma was suspected. Continue with the MRI. The T1-weighted image shows a slightly hyperintense lesion with a fluid-fluid level (arrow). After gadolineum administration there is enhancement of the cyst wall. The lesion subsided with conservative therapy. Ranula
Ranula:
A ranula is a fluid filled cyst originating from the sublingual salivary gland. It can extend into the floor of the mouth and be visible on inspection of the oral cavity. It can also extend through or over the mylohyoid muscle and is then called a "plunging ranula" and present as a submental or submandibular mass. Here an image of a sixteen-year-old boy with a firm swelling under the tongue on the left side. Ultrasound showed an anechoic mass continuous with the sublingual salivary gland. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Jugular ectasia:
In some children a swelling can appear in the lower neck during straining. This is often caused by dilatation of the internal jugular vein as can easily be demonstrated by ultrasound that will show the variations in caliber of the vein. An example is shown on the video of a seven-year-old boy, initially suspected of a laryngocele.
Solid lesions - Lymph nodes:
This image shows a commonly used classification for the location of lymph nodes. Submental and submandibular nodes
* Level 2 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, above the level of the hyoid bone
* Level 3 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, between the hyoid bone and cricoid cartilage
* Level 4 Nodes along the internal jugular vein, below the cricoid cartilage
* Level 5 Posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the clavicles
* Level 6 Anterior to the thyroid gland Normal lymph nodes are always visible with ultrasound in children. A normal lymph node: The normal jugulodigastric node which is located below the mandibular angle can have a short axis of 15 mm. Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck are very common in children. In most cases these are reactive nodes as a reaction to a nearby infection. Less commonly it is due to a primary infection of the lymph nodes itself, which is called lymphadenitis. Usually the terms reactive lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis are used synonymously. Although ultrasound cannot always reliably distinguish lymphadenitis from a malignant lymphoma, the following table can be helpful to decide whether an excision biopsy should be done or that a "wait and scan" policy can be adopted. Supraclavicular lymph nodes should always be considered to be malignant until proven otherwise.
Reactive lymph nodes:
Reactive lymph nodes are a reaction to nearby inflammation. They are slightly enlarged and more hypoechoic than normal with a broader echogenic center. Here a six-year-old boy with weight loss, fatigue and lymphadenopathy. On ultrasound a string of enlarged lymph nodes with preservation of a echogenic hilum was seen. Excision biopsy showed reactive lymph nodes. Here a two-year-old girl with a palpable swelling in the left neck since a few weeks. On ultrasound the lymph nodes are enlarged with preservation of the echogenic hilus and normal perfusion. It was decided to wait and see and the nodes slowly shrunk.
Bacterial or viral lymphadenitis:
A bacterial or viral lymphadenitis is an infection of the node itself. Bacterial lymphadenitis is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or B-hemolytic Streptococcus. The nodes, which are frequently located in the submandibular region, are painful and the skin is warm and red. Bacterial lymphadenitis has an acute onset and is usually unilateral. The ultrasound image is of a one-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck for three weeks. A partly liquefied lymphnode is seen with infiltration of the surrounding subcutaneous fat. The swelling disappeared on antibiotic treatment. Abscess formation is clinically difficult to detect, and ultrasound is also not reliable. Signs of liquefaction are areas with a detectable wall and more hypoechoic center or areas with mobile, moving echoreflections. According to the literature there are 30% false-positive ánd false-negative results. Here a one-year-old boy with a swelling in the right neck for one week. Ultrasound shows an enlarged lymph node with areas of liquefaction. It was incised and drained, after which the infection subsided.
Cat-scratch disease:
Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae. The infection is the result of a scratch or bite of a cat. It is the most common cause of chronic axillary lymphadenopathy. The symptoms are often mild and lymph node swelling can be prolonged. The clinical diagnosis can be difficult and PCR results are insensitive. On ultrasound the affected nodes are round, heterogeneously hypoechoic, hypervascular, and with some surrounding inflammation. The nodes are a bit tender but not painful. They can be difficult to distinguish from malignant nodes. Here an ultrasund image of a sixteen-year-old girl, who was treated for recurrence of acute lymphatic leukaemia. Six months after the last treatment, she developed a swelling in the left shoulder region. A hypoechoic node without any internal structure was seen. It was excised. The final diagnosis was, surprisingly, Bartonella henselae. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Cat-scratch disease 2 Here a video of a fifteen-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck. There are multiple lymph nodes with surrounding infiltrated tissue. Continue with next video. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. After a week suppuration was seen. Aspirated pus was positive for Bartonella henselae. The boy was successfully treated with antibiotics. Two-year-old boy with a progressive swelling in the neck. No effect of antibiotics. An atypical Mycobacterium infection (avium) was confirmed. The anechoic parts (arrow) in the node are often seen in atypical Mycobacteria infection.
Mycobacteria:
Infection with atypical Mycobacteria generally occurs in patients between one and five years of age. There are few clinical symptoms, most often only a palpable mass. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually unilateral and in the pre-auricular or submandibular area. There is often a pronounced skin discoloration. Tuberculosis (TB) and atypical Mycobacteria frequently present with a single enlarged node and some smaller satellite lesions. There is central necrosis, thickening of the overlying skin, surrounding inflammation and after a while a confluent mass. Fistulas may be present. Calcifications are seen more commonly in TB infections than in atypical Mycobacterial infections, especially after treatment. Continue with next image... Three months later the swelling is still present. The deeper lymphnode has liquefied. After another four months a lymph node had undergone liquefaction and discharged in the surrounding tissue. Here an ultrasound image of a 6-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck. Fine calcifications are seen in the lymph node. The Mantoux and Qferon test were positive, but cultures for tuberculosis were negative. The patient was treated with tuberculostatics with good result.
Malignant lymphoma:
Malignant lymphoma presents with painless lymphadenopathy. In Hodgkin lymphoma the cervical nodes are most commonly involved, while in non-Hodgkin lymphoma the nodes of the Waldeyer ring are often involved. On ultrasound the affected nodes are round, homogeneously hypoechoic and the normal echogenic hilum is absent. The diagnosis is made by ultrasound-guided biopsy or excision. PET/CT will demonstrate the extension of the disease. The images are of a fourteen-year-old boy with a painless swelling in the left neck. The ultrasound shows several enlarged hypoechoic lymhnodes, that lack an hyper-echoic hilum. Here another fourteen-year-old boy with a painless swelling in the left neck. Ultrasound showed several enlarged lymhnodes. Continue with the MR and PET/CT... A coronal STIR image shows the pathologic lymph node masses similar to the PET-CT. The diagnosis was Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Solid lesions - not lymph nodes:
The most common cause of a solid lesion in the neck is an enlarged lymph node as we just discussed. Other solid lesions in the neck are far less common. They are listed in the table. In many cases the imaging findings in a solid lesion will be non-specific and a diagnosis can only be made through biopsy or excision.
Thyroid lesions:
Congenital anomalies The most common anomalie is a partial or complete agenesis of the gland. In partial agenesis the gland is ectopic and located anywhere between the base of the tongue and the thyroid cartilage. Mostly near or in the tongue, a lingual thyroid. Here an image of a newborn with an abnormal thyroid test. No thyroid gland is visible in the neck, neither in its usual position nor higher up in the neck. Thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules are common. They can be single or multiple. Some are purely cystic but most are solid. On ultrasound they are isoechoic with the normal gland. In a goiter a multitude of solid nodules are seen. If there is concern about a possible malignancy fine needle aspiration can be done. Preferably a technician of the cytology department is present to make a quick assessment of the retrieved cells to ascertain that thyroid cells are aspirated, and not only blood. This is an ultrasound image of a six-year-old girl with a small cyst with a septum in the right thyroid lobe. It remained unchanged over a year. Hashimoto's thyroiditis: An enlarged thyroid gland with a diffuse inhomogeneous structure and hyperemia is seen in a ten-year-old girl Thyroiditis The most common forms of thyroiditis are Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves disease. Both Hashimoto's thyreoiditis and Graves disease can present as an enlarged and hyperemic thyroid. Hashimoto's thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is an auto-immune disease. It presents with hypothyroidism. Although primarily a disease of the middle-aged it can present in children. On ultrasound the gland is diffusely enlarged and inhomogeneous. On color doppler the blood flow is often normal but can be increased like in Graves' disease. In a later stage the gland shrinks. Graves disease In Graves disease the thyroid gland is also enlarged and shows an increased perfusion. On color Doppler it has been described as an inferno in red and blue. Here an image of a 16-year-old girl with hyperthreoidism. A diffusely enlarged thyroid gland is seen with hyperemia. The final diagnosis was Graves disease. She was treated with I-131. Ultrasound image of the thymus in a two-months-old boy.
Thymus:
The thymus is located in the upper mediastinum and can be visualized with a suprasternal scan plane. With increasing age its echogenicity increases and becomes more granular. Ultrasound is ideal to demonstrate the thymus as a cause of a widened upper mediastinum in infants. Sometimes the thymus causes a swelling in the suprasternal notch on straining. Such a herniating thymus can be demostrated with ultrasound. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. The thymus is located in the upper mediastinum and can be visualized with a suprasternal scan plane. Ultrasound image of the thymus in an eight-year-old boy. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Here a video of a six-month-old boy with a mass which was sometimes visible in the suprasternal notch. While crying the thymus was seen to herniate in front of the trachea. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Ectopic thymus:
Ectopic thymic tissue may occur anywhere along the path of descent through the thymopharyngeal duct. When it presents as a neck mass, it can be mistaken for a tumor. The ectopic part of the thymus has the same echo characteristics as the normal thymus. The video shows an ectopic thymic remnant, which was an incidental finding in the neck, detected on a MRI of the brain in a 2-year-old boy. The ectopic thymus has the ultrasound characteristics as the normal gland. Here images of a six-month old boy with a vocal cord paralysis. The MRI examination shows a mass between the parotid and submandibular gland (yellow arrow). The signal characteristics are equal to the thymus (green arrow). Ultrasound confirmed an ectopic thymic remnant (yellow arrow), with identical sonographic characteristics as the orthotopic thymus (green arrow). Left: orthotopic thymus; right: ectopic thymus LEFT: normal sternocleidomastoid muscle. RIGHT: Hyperechoic mass in sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Fibromatosis colli:
Fibromatosis collis is a swelling of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in a newborn. It is probably caused by pressure necrosis of the muscle during delivery. Contrary to common belief it is not caused by hemorrhage. 50% of affected babies are born in breech. The swelling becomes apparent one to three weeks after birth. Sometimes a torticollis is noted. The swelling will usually regress spontaneously within a few months. On ultrasound an enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is seen. It can affect the whole muscle or part of it. The sternal head is always affected, and often the cleidal head as well. It can be hypo-, iso- or hyperechoic. Longitudinal images of the swelling will demonstrate its muscular origin. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Here a video of a two-month-old boy with a torticollis. A mass is seen within the enlarged sternocleidomastoid muscle. The diagnosis is fibromatosis collis Hemangioma
Vascular anomalies:
Vascular anomalies are classified into proliferative vascular tumors and vascular malformations. This classification is important as the treatment is different. Some vascular tumors will regress spontaneously or after administration of beta-blockers. Vascular malformations however need excision, sclerosing, or embolisation, if treatment is requested. The classifications of these lesions is constantly changing and beyond the scope of this article. A recent article on vascular anomalies provides a new classification (2). Hemangioma Hemangiomas are benign vascular neoplasms. They are the most common tumors of infancy. 60% of hemangiomas are seen in the head-neck regio. They usually appear in the first weeks after birth, show rapid growth, followed by spontaneous involution. Here we see images of a highly vascular lesion in the left submandibular region, which was present at birth. Three months later it had decreased in size. Infantile hemangioma A soft swelling was present on the side of the head in a six-week-old boy. It was small at birth and showed rapid growth. This is typical for an infantile hemangioma. Venous malformation Venous malformation A six-month-old boy presented with a swelling in the left neck at birth. Several ultrasound examinations could not differentiate between a hemangioma or a venous malformation. At six months of age, the ultrasound showed a lesion, which was mostly composed of vessels which increased in size on straining. On color Doppler the lesion showed increased flow while crying. The final diagnosis on imaging and on clinical examination was a venous malformation. Firm tumor in the right temporal area of a 2-year-old boy. Ultrasound shows an echogenic lesion with a well demarcated wall and slight posterior shadowing, characteristic for a pilomatrixoma.
Pilomatrixoma:
A pilomatrixoma or epithelial inclusion cyst of Malherbe is a benign skin lesion associated with hairfollicles. It presents as a firm, mobile, painless swelling. Sometimes a blue discoloration is present. They vary in size from a few millimetres to 3 centimetres. The majority occurs in the head and neck region. On ultrasound a pilomatrixoma presents as an oval tumor lcated between the cutis and subcutis. It is hyperechoic, sometimes with calcification and acoustic shadowing. The wall is often hypoechoic and on color Doppler tiny vessels can be seen in the wall. These images are of a firm mass in the neck of a 17-year-old girl. A cytologic sampling was inconclusive. Ultrasound shows a typical pilomatrixoma, confirmed at pathology after excision. Some perfusion in the wall of the pilomatrixoma is seen. Large pilomatrixoma on the upper arm of a 12-year-old girl.
Salivary glands:
Enlargement of the salivary glands can be diffuse or focal. Diffuse swelling mostly affects the parotid glands. If it is bilateral it can be caused by autoimmune diseases (like Sjögren's disease) or infections (HIV). On ultrasound many small hypoechoic lesions are present. Unilateral swelling can be caused by a bacterial parotitis. Hemangioma is the most common parotid gland tumor of childhood, which involute in the course of a few months.
Teratoma:
Teratomas of the neck are rare in children. Teratomas are composed of all three germ layers. They often present at birth. On ultrasound they are composed of solid and cystic parts and often contain calcifications. They can have a close connection to the thyroid gland. If the extension is unclear MRI can be done. Here we see a midline tumor in the anterior neck of a three-day-old boy. Calcifications and solid and cystic parts are seen. Pathology was compatible with a mature teratoma.
Paraganglioma:
Here images of a 17-year-old boy with a swelling in the neck, thought to represent a branchial cleft cyst. An echogenic solid mass was seen with moderate perfusion on color doppler examination. No specific diagnosis could be made. The final pathologic diagnosis was a paraganglioma, a very uncommon finding in children.
Neurofibroma:
Here a large neurofibroma in the subcutaneous tissue in the neck of a 10-year-old boy with a known neurofibromatosis.
Neuroblastoma:
Neuroblastoma usually presents as an abdominal mass in young children. In the neck it accounts for 1-5% of neuroblastomas. On ultrasound a heterogeneously echogenic mass is seen, often with some calcifications (1). Here a ten-month-old girl with a lump in the neck. Ultrasound shows a inhomogeneous mass with some calcifications. There were also three enlarged lymph nodes with calcifications. Imaging could not make a definitive diagnosis.

Osteolytic - well defined bone tumors:
Henk Jan van der Woude and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam and the Rijnland hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2011-01-01 In the article Bone Tumors - Differential diagnosis we discuss a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions. In this article we will discuss the differential diagnosis of well-defined osteolytic bone tumors and tumor-like lesions. Abbreviations used: SBC = Simple Bone Cyst Introduction
Introduction:
On the left the most common well-defined bone tumors and tumor-like lesions. These lesions are sometimes referred to as benign cystic lesions, which is a misnomer since most of them are not cystic, except for SBC and ABC. It is true that in patients under 30 years a well-defined border means that we are dealing with a benign lesion, but in patients over 40 years metastases and multiple myeloma have to be included in the differential diagnosis. On the left a table with well-defined osteolytic bone tumors and tumor-like lesions in different age-groups. Notice the following:
Fegnomashic:
Most bone tumors present as well-defined osteolytic lesions, sometimes referred to as 'bubbly lesions'. It is important to have a good differential diagnostic approach to these lesions. You can use the table above, but another way to look at the differential diagnosis of well defined osteolytic bone lesions is to use the mnemonic Fegnomashic, which is popularized by Clyde Helms (1). Some prefer to use the mnemonic Fogmachines, which is formed by the same letters, but is a real word. Fibrous dysplasia: various presentations with or without sclerotic margin, with groundglass appearance, with calcifications or ossifications
Fibrous dysplasia:
Fibrous dysplasia is a benign disorder characterized by tumor-like proliferation of fibro-osseus tissue and can look like anything. FD most commonly presents as a long lesion in a long bone. FD is often purely lytic and takes on ground-glass look as the matrix calcifies. In many cases there is bone expansion and bone deformity. The ipsilateral proximal femur is invariably affected when the pelvis is involved. When FD in the tibia is considered, adamantinoma should be in the differential diagnosis. Discriminator: More on Fibrous dysplasia
Enchondroma:
Enchondroma is a benign cartilage tumor. Frequently it is a coincidental finding. In the phalanges of the hand it frequently presents with a fracture. It is the most common lesion in the phalanges, i.e. a well-defined lytic lesion in the hand is almost always an enchondroma. In some locations it can be difficult to differentiate between enchondroma and bone infarct. It is almost impossible to differentiate between enchondroma and low grade chondrosarcoma based on radiographic features alone. Ollier's disease is multiple enchondromas. Maffucci's syndrome is multiple enchondromas with soft tissue hemangiomas. Features that favor the diagnosis of a low-grade chondrosarcoma: Discriminators :
Eosinophilic granuloma:
EG is a non-neoplastic proliferation of histiocytes and is also known as Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of any sclerotic or osteolytic lesion, either well-defined or ill-defined, in patients under the age of 30. The diagnosis EG can be excluded in age > 30. EG is usually monostotic, but can be polyostotic. Discriminator: Giant cell tumor in the tibia abuts the articular surface
Giant cell tumor:
Giant cell tumor is a lesion with multinucleated giant cells. In most cases it is a benign lesion. Malignant GCT is rare and differentiation between benign or malignant GCT is not possible based on the radiographs. GCT is also included in the differential diagnosis of an ill-defined osteolytic lesion, provided the age and the site of the lesion are compatible. Discriminators: NOF: typical presentation as an eccentric, multi-loculated subcortical lesion with a central lucency and a scalloped sclerotic margin.
NOF:
NOF is a benign well-defined, solitary lesion due to proliferation of fibrous tissue. It is the most common bone lesion. NOF is frequently a coincidental finding with or without a fracture. NOF usually has a sclerotic border and can be expansile. They regress spontaneously with gradual fill in. NOF may occur as a multifocal lesion. The radiographic appearance is almost always typical, and as such additional imaging and biopsy is not warranted. Discriminators:
Osteoblastoma:
Osteoblastoma is a rare solitary, benign tumor that produces osteoid and bone. Consider osteoblastoma when ABC is in the differential diagnosis of a spine lesion (figure). A typical osteoblastoma is larger than 2 cm, otherwise it completely resembles osteoid osteoma. Discriminator:
Metastases:
Metastases are the most common malignant bone tumors. Metastases must be included in the differential diagnosis of any bone lesion, whether well-defined or ill-defined osteolytic or sclerotic in age > 40. Bone metastases have a predilection for hematopoietic marrow sites: spine, pelvis, ribs, cranium and proximal long bones: femur, humerus. Metastases can be included in the differential diagnosis if a younger patient is known to have a malignancy, like neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma. Most common osteolytic metastases: kidney, lung, colon and melanoma. Most common osteosclerotic metastases: prostate and breast. Discriminator: Multiple Myeloma: multiple lytic lesions in the humerus
Multiple Myeloma:
Multiple myeloma must be included in the differential diagnosis of any lytic bone lesion, whether well-defined or ill-defined in age > 40. The most common location is in the axial skeleton (spine, skull, pelvis and ribs) and in the diaphysis of long bones (femur and humerus). Most common presentation: multiple lytic 'punched out' lesions. Multiple myeloma does not show any uptake on bone scan. Discriminator: Multiple Myeloma (2) Differential diagnosis: On the left a CT-image of a patient with multiple myeloma. Notice the numerous osteolytic lesions and permeative cortical destruction pattern. In the left sacral wing there is a larger lesion with a high density due to replacement of fatty bone marrow by myeloma (red arrow). ABC of the proximal fibula: well-defined, expansile osteolytic lesion with thin peripheral bone shell
Aneurysmal Bone Cyst:
ABC is a solitary expansile well-defined osteolytic bone lesion, that is filled with blood. It is named aneurysmal because it is expansile. ABC is thought to be the result of a reactive process secondary to trauma or increased venous pressure. Sometimes an underlying lesion like GCT, osteoblastoma or chondroblastoma can be found. ABC can occur almost anywhere in the skeleton. Discriminators: More on ABC SBC: well-defined osteolytic lesion without expansion of the proximal meta-diaphysis of the humerus with pathologic fracture
Solitary Bone Cyst:
Solitary bone cyst, also known as unicameral bone cyst, is a true cyst. Many well-defined osteolytic lesions are often called cystic, but this is a misnomer. SBC frequently presents with a fracture. Sometimes a fallen fragment is appreciated. Predilection sites: proximal humerus and femur. Usually less expansion compared with ABC. Differential diagnosis: ABC, FD when cystic. SBC may migrate from metaphysis to diaphysis during growth of the bone. Discriminators:
Hyperparathyroidism:
Brown tumors can occur in any bone and present as osteolytic lesions with sharp margins. Septa and ridges may be seen. Differential diagnosis: ABC, metastases and GCT depending on location and age. On the left a patient who had a nefrectomy for renal cell carcinoma and who was on dialysis. Multiple well-defined osteolytic lesions were found on a follow up CT scan. The differential diagnosis included metastases and Brown tumors in hyperparathyroidism. Biopsy revealed Brown tumor. Discriminators: Osteomyelitis
Infection:
Infection or osteomyelitis is the great mimicker of bone tumors. It has a broad spectrum of radiographic features and occurs at any age and has no typical location. In the chronic stage it can mimic a benign bone tumor (Brodies abscess). In the acute stage it can mimic a malignant bone tumor with ill-defined margins, cortical destruction and an aggressive type of periostitis. Only when there is a thick solid periosteal reaction we can recognize the non-malignant underlying process. Discriminators: Chondroblastoma: notice extensive edema (middle) and fluid-fluid level due to secondary ABC.
Chondroblastoma:
The patella, carpal and tarsal bones can be regarded as epiphysis concerning the differential diagnosis. On the left a chondroblastoma located in the patella. Discriminators : Chondromyxoid Fibroma
Chondromyxoid Fibroma:
Chondromyxoid Fibroma is a rare lesion. CMF resembles NOF. Preferential sites: proximal tibia and foot. Although the name suggests that CMF is a chondroid lesion, calcifications are usually not seen. On the left images of a CMF. There is an eccentric osteolytic lesion in the metaphysis of the proximal tibia. On the inner side there is a sclerotic margin. On the outer side there is a regular cortical destruction with peripheral bone layer. The MR also shows a sclerotic margin with low signal intensity.

Trigeminal neuralgia:
Loes Braun, Carolien Toxopeus and Robin Smithuis
Antoni van Leeuwenhoek and OLVG hospital in Amsterdam and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 01-09-2022 Trigeminal neuralgia is a  disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral brief electric shock-like pains, abrupt in onset and termination, limited to the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve.
Several conditions may cause trigeminal neuralgia, but the most common cause is neurovascular compression.
In this article we will discuss the many causes of neuralgia in relation to the anatomical location.
This can help you to systematically study all the important regions in the course of the trigeminal nerve.
Introduction:
The pathology of the trigeminal nerve is related to the location. In the illustration the five different segments of the trigeminal nerve are presented, which will be discussed in more detail in the following chapters. Brainstem: trigeminal nucleus *Cisternal segment* *Meckel's cave* Cavernous segment Peripheral segment
Brain stem segment:
Pathology in the
brain stem segment is most often due to demyelination by multiple
sclerosis. 
Other types of pathology in the brain stem segment are neoplasms
(mostly glioma and metastases), vascular lesions (infarction, cavernoma) and
infections (rhombencephalitis). The trigeminal nerve originates from two separate nuclei in
the pons: the sensory division from the sensory nucleus (green dot) and the motor division
from the motor nucleus (red dot).
This first part is called the brain stem segment. From these nuclei, the trigeminal nerve courses anteriorly,
to the ventrolateral surface of the pons to continue with the cisternal segment in the prepontine cistern. The trigeminal nerve is the largest of all cranial nerves. 
It consists of a sensory and a motor division. The sensory division – which is the largest of the two – innervates sensibility in the whole face. The smaller motor division innervates: The sensory nucleus is situated laterally in the tegmentum, anterolateral to the fourth ventricle (green dot). The motor nucleus is situated anteromedial to the sensory nucleus (red dot). This image is of a 26 year old male who developed slowly progressive facial hypesthesy on the
right. The axial T2W image shows a hyperintense lesion at the
trigeminal nucleus (arrow). 
This may be a sign of demyelinsation, for
instance in multiple sclerosis
Cisternal segment:
The cisternal segment is – almost without exception - the source of a true trigeminal neuralgia caused by neurovascular compression. Other causes of pathology in the cisternal
segment causing trigeminal neuropathy are far less common, like neoplasms, mostly schwannoma, meningioma and epidermoid. Furthermore, the cisternal segment may be subject to infection or inflammation, for instance trigeminal neuritis.
Neurovascular compression:
Neurovascular compression is defined by specific radiologic criteria: Neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve is most often caused by contact with the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) or less frequently the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), or smaller branches of the basilar artery. Only a few cases have been reported in which neurovascular compression was caused by contact with an aneurysm, vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia, an AVM, an AV-fistula or even a vein. Root entry zone
The cisternal segment starts where the trigeminal
nerve enters the prepontine cistern. 
This is called the root entry zone. 
The root entry zone comprises the transition zone from central
myelin (oligodendrocytes) to peripheral myelin (Schwann cells). This transition zone measures approximately 2 mm long and is situated at approximately 5-7 mm from the surface of the pons.
At this point, the nerve is vulnerable to  pressure. In the prepontine cistern, the sensory and motor divisions have a parallel but separate course, creating a characteristic fan-like appearance (arrow). Neurovascular compression at the root entry zone A 74 year old male  has been experiencing
an ‘220V-like’ pain in his right eyebrow, cheek and mandible. 
These symptoms are
evoked by washing his face and brushing his teeth. Scroll through the axial 3D FIESTA images and the
postcontrast axial 3D T1W images. Then continue reading. Both the axial 3D FIESTA and postcontrast axial 3D T1W
images show: These findings fulfill the criteria for a neurovascular compression. Trigeminal schwannoma These images are of a 49-year old
 male with sensory problems in the left side of his face and pressure behind
 his left eye. The axial T2W shows
 a lesion in Meckel’s cave and the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve.
 The component in Meckel’s cave is solid and shows homogeneous enhancement on
 post-contrast T1W imaging (arrow). 
The component in the cerebellopontine cistern is
 almost completely cystic and shows only rim enhancement. The lesion is a
 trigeminal schwannoma. 
The growth of this lesion along the nerve, leading to
 a constriction at the entrance of Meckel’s cave, causes the classic ‘dumbbell
 shape’.
Meckel's cave segment:
Pathology in Meckel’s cave leading to trigeminal
neuropathy, mostly concerns neoplasms, either primary, secondary or extrinsic. Primary lesions, originating from the nerve itself,
are mostly schwannomas, meningeomas, and epidermoids. Secondary neoplasms – involving the nerve, but not
originating from it -  are mostly based
on perineural spread.  The spread can be
retrograde (from the peripheral branches) or antergrade (from the cisternal
segment). Extrinsic lesions mostly originate from the skull
base. After traversing the cerebellopontine and prepontine
cisterns, the trigeminal nerve enters Meckel’s cave, which forms the third
segment. 
In Meckel’s cave the trigeminal ganglion is located also known as Gasser’s or semilunate ganglion. At
the ganglion, the sensory division of the trigeminal nerve divides into three
parts: The motor division does not pass through the ganglion, but rather underneath it. Together with nV3, the motor division leaves the
intracranial compartment via the foramen ovale. A 45 year-old
 female with a history of pain on the right side of the mandible, alleviated
 by extraction of multiple dental elements. 
However, since one month, she is
 experiencing the same type of pain once more. The pain is sharp and radiates
 from the chin, via the right side of the face to the skull. The pain is
 evoked by talking, eating, and touching the right sides of the face. Image3D FIESTA shows
 a lesion in Meckel’s cave, hyperintense on DWI, hypo-intense on ADC (not
 shown), extending into the cisternal segment.
This lesion is
 suspicious for an epidermoid.
Cavernous segment:
Primary lesions originating from the cavernous
segment itself are quite rare. These lesions – mostly schwannomas, meningeomas
and epidermoids – usually originate from the third segment, extending into the cavernous sinus. 
Trigeminal lesions in the cavernous segment are mostly secondary due to perineural spread or
metastases. Furthermore, pathology of the cavernous segment may be due to
extrinsic lesions, for instance lesions originating from the skull base, the
meninges or vascular structures, for instance carotid aneurysms. Moreover, the
cavernous segment may be subject to infectious or inflammatory pathology, for
instance Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, which is a severe unilateral periorbital headache associated with painful and restricted eye movements. The first two
 branches of the trigeminal nerve – the ophthalmic nerve and the
 maxillary nerve – continue their course from Meckel’s cave into the
 cavernous sinus. The course of the ophthalmic nerve is quite long and follows
 the lateral wall of the sinus. The course of the maxillary nerve is much shorter
 and follows the caudal border. 
Some sources even state that the maxillary
 nerve does not pass through the
 sinus at all, but rather underneath
 it. 67- year old
 female with a history of breast cancer with metastases to bone and liver. She
 presents with numbness on the left side of her face. Axial 2D FLAIR
 show an asymmetric cavernous sinus, with dural thickening on the left. Post-contrast imaging shows increased enhancement of the left side of the
 cavernous sinus, extending into Meckel’s cave. Suspicious for
 metastasis of breast carcinoma.
Peripheral segment:
Pathology of the peripheral branches of the trigeminal
nerve mostly concerns perineural spread from malignancies in the head and neck
region. 
Due to its extensive branching pattern, the trigeminal nerve is especially
vulnerable to this type of pathology.  Perineural spread may be recognized as
thickening and enhancement of the nerve, mostly – but not exclusively - in
retrograde direction. Furthermore, the peripheral branches may be subject to
primary neoplasms, mostly schwannomas or neurofibromas. Moreover,
the peripheral branches may be affected by infectious or inflammatory
processes, mostly neuritis originating from the paranasal sinuses. Ophtalmic nerve
The nV1 leaves the cavernous sinus through the superior
orbital fissure and enters the orbit. It subdivides into three smaller
branches. The main branch continues its course via the supra-orbital foramen to
form the supra-orbital nerve. Maxillary nerve
The nV2 leaves the cavernous sinus via the foramen rotundum
and enters the pterygopalatine fossa. There, the nerve subdivides into four
smaller branches. The main branch continues via the infra-orbital foramen into
the orbit and via the infra-orbital canal into the face to form the infra-orbital
nerve. Mandibular nerve
The nV3 does not pass through the
cavernous sinus. Instead it leaves Meckel’s cave – together with the motor
division – via the foramen ovale and enters the infratemporal fossa. There, it
subdivides into four smaller branches.
The main branch – the inferior alveolar
nerve – continues its course via the mandibular foramen into the mandible and
through the mandibular canal and the foramen mentale into the face to form the
mental nerve. After entering the infratemporal fossa, the motor
division subdivides into two smaller branches: the masticator nerve and the
mylohyoid nerve. 70 year old male with a history of melanoma and
orbital exenterition. Recently, he has been experiencing tingling and numbness
in the left side of his face. These symptoms cannot be evoked and respond well
to pain medication. Scroll through the axial and coronal postcontrast 3D
T1W images. Then continue reading. Axial and coronal postcontrast 3D T1W images show
thickening and enhancement of nV1 in the supra-orbital fissure (a and b, arrow),
nV2 in the foramen rotundum (a and b, dashed arrow), and nV3 in the foramen
ovale (c and d, arrow). These abnormalities are suspicious for perineural
spread of melanoma. Click on the image below and watch the video of Medical Action Myanmar of Dr Frank Smithuis, who is the brother of Robin Smithuis.

Liver - Segmental Anatomy:
Robin Smithuis and Eduard E. de Lange
Radiology Department of the Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands and University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, USA.:
Publicationdate 2006-05-07 / update 2015-10-15 / 2022-06-13 The anatomy of the liver can be described using two different aspects: morphological anatomy and functional anatomy. The traditional morphological anatomy is based on the external appearance of the liver and does not show the internal features of vessels and biliary ducts branching, which are of obvious importance in hepatic surgery. The French surgeon and anatomist Claude Couinaud was the first to divide the liver into eight functionally indepedent segments allowing resection of segments without damaging other segments.
Segmental anatomy:
Segmental anatomy according to Couinaud. Click to enlarge.
Couinaud classification:
The Couinaud classification of liver anatomy divides the liver into eight functionally indepedent segments. Each segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow and biliary drainage. In the centre of each segment there is a branch of the portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct. In the periphery of each segment there is vascular outflow through the hepatic veins.
The liver is divided in three vertical planes: Here another illustration of the functional segmental liver anatomy. Portal vein 
The portal vein divides the liver into upper and lower segments.
The left and right portal veins branch superiorly and inferiorly to project into the center of each segment. Left hepatic vein
The significance of the left hepatic vein is somewhat controversial. Some authors have shown it to coincide with the umbilical fissure, but in reality the left hepatic vein courses to the lateral to the umbilical fissure [fig].
While some authors have claimed that the division between segments II and III is formed by the transverse plane of the left portal vein, most investigators feel that it is the plane defined by the left hepatic vein.
In actual practice, when a lesion is located within the lateral segment of the left lobe, both Couinaud segments II and III are usually removed based on the plane formed by the umbilical fissure (i.e. left lateral segmentectomy). On a frontal view of the liver the posteriorly located segments VI and VII are not visible. The illustration above is a schematic presentation of the liver segments. In reality however the proportions are different. On a normal frontal view the segments VI and VII are not visible because they are located more posteriorly. The right border of the liver is formed by segment V and VIII. Although segment IV is part of the left hemiliver, it is situated more to the right. Couinaud divided the liver into a functional left and right liver by a main portal scissurae containing the middle hepatic vein. This is known as Cantlie's line. Cantlie's line runs from the middle of the gallbladder fossa anteriorly to the inferior vena cava posteriorly. Clockwise numbering of the segments
Segments numbering:
There are eight liver segments. Segment IV is sometimes divided into segment IVa and IVb according to Bismuth. The numbering of the segments is in a clockwise manner. Segment I (the caudate lobe) is located posteriorly. It is not visible on a frontal view. Image at the level of the superior liver segments.
Transverse anatomy:
This figure is a transverse image through the superior liver segments, that are divided by the right and middle hepatic veins and the falciform ligament. Image at the level of the left portal vein. This is a transverse image at the level of the left portal vein. At this level the left portal vein divides the left lobe into the superior segments (II and IVa) and the inferior segments (III and IVb). The left portal vein is at a higher level than the right portal vein. Image at the level of the right portal vein. This image is at the level of the right portal vein. At this level the right portal vein divides the right lobe of the liver into superior segments (VII and VIII) and the inferior segments (V and VI). The level of the right portal vein is inferior to the level of the left portal vein. Image at the level of the splenic vein. At the level of the splenic vein, which is below the level of the right portal vein, only the inferior segments are visible.
How to separate liver segments on cross sectional imaging:
Left liver: lateral(II/III) vs medial segment (IVA/B) Extrapolate a line along the falciform ligament superiorly to the confluence of the left and middle hepatic veins at the IVC (blue line). Left vs Right liver: IVA/B vs V/VIII Extrapolate a line from the gallbladder fossa superiorly along the middle hepatic vein to the IVC (red line). Right liver: anterior (V/VIII) vs posterior segment (VI/VII) Extrapolate a line along the right hepatic vein from the IVC inferiorly to the lateral liver margin (green line).

Video of MRI anatomy:
Hypertrophy of caudate lobe in a patient with livercirrhosis. Notice the small lobulated right hemiliver.
Caudate lobe:
The caudate lobe or segment I is located posteriorly. The caudate lobe is anatomically different from other lobes in that it often has direct connections to the IVC through hepatic veins, that are separate from the main hepatic veins. The caudate lobe may be supplied by both right and left branches of the portal vein. This CT-image is of a patient with liver cirrhosis with extreme atrophy of the right lobe, normal volume of the left lobe and hypertrophy of the caudate lobe. Due to a different blood supply the caudate lobe is spared from the disease process and hypertrophied to compensate for the loss of normal liverparenchyma.

Extended Left or left trisectionectomysegment II, III, IV, V and VIII (± segment I). Many surgeons prefer to use the term "extended" instead of trisectionectomy to indicate that some adjacent tissue of segment 4, or 5/8, as applicable is included rather than the entire segment 4, or 5/8.

Mediastinal Masses - differential diagnosis:
Sanjeev Bhalla, Marieke Hazewinkel and Robin Smithuis
Cardiothoracic Imaging Section of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, St. Louis, USA and the Radiology department the Medical Centre Alkmaar and the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2007-06-05 This review is based on a presentation given by Sanjeev Bhalla and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Marieke Hazewinkel and Robin Smithuis. Sanjeev Bhalla is section chief of the Cardiothoracic Imaging Section of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology. This review will focus on how to narrow down the differential diagnosis of mediastinal lesions by localizing and characterizing them.
Introduction:
Whenever you see a mass on a chest x-ray that is possibly located within the mediastinum, your goal is to determine the following: The table on the left is the overall table for mediastinal masses. In the next paragraphs we will discuss each compartment separately. Statistically, it is important to remember the following: Most masses (> 60%) are: In children the most common (> 80%) are: In adults the most common are:
Localize to the mediastinum:
LEFT: A lung mass abutts the mediastinal surface and creates acute angles with the lung.RIGHT: A mediastinal mass will sit under the surface of the mediastinum, creating obtuse angles with the lung. The following characteristics indicate that a lesion originates within the mediastinum: A lung mass abutts the mediastinal surface and creates acute angles with the lung, while a mediastinal mass will sit under the surface creating obtuse angles with the lung (Figure). On the left you see two different patients. Describe the findings and continue. On the x-ray on the left there is a lesion that has an acute border with the mediastinum. This must be a lung mass. The chest radiograph on the right shows a lesion with an obtuse angle to the mediastinum. This must be a mediastinal mass. Since there is a silhouette-sign with the right heart border - which is located anteriorly - we can deduce that the mass must be located within the anterior mediastinum. The lesion on the left was a pancoast tumor. The lesion on the right was a thymoma, located within the anterior mediastinum.
Localize within the mediastinum:
The mediastinum can be divided into anterior, middle and posterior compartments. It is important to remember that there is no tissue plane separating these compartments. On the lateral radiograph the anterior and middle compartments can be separated by drawing an imaginary line anterior to the trachea and posteriorly to the inferior vena cava. The middle and posterior compartments can be separated by an imaginary line passing 1 cm posteriorly to the anterior border of the vertebral bodies. This division allows us to make a more narrow differential diagnosis. In many hospitals a CT will be made to further analyze and characterize anterior and middle mediastinal masses. An MRI is usually made to analyze masses located in the posterior compartment because the majority of these masses turn out to be neurogenic in nature. An additional CT can be performed, when bone needs to be assessed.
Anterior Mediastinum:
The anterior mediastinum contains the following structures: thymus, lymph nodes, ascending aorta, pulmonary artery, phrenic nerves and thyroid. The most common lesions that you will see in the anterior mediastinum will either be of thymic or lymph node origin. Even the germ cell tumors arise from the pluripotent cells of the thymus. Before you want to biopsy an anterior mediastinal mass, do not forget thta some of these lesions can be vascular in origin. The four T's make up the mnemonic for anterior mediastinal masses:: On conventional radiographs look for the signs listed in the table on the left. The finding of an obliterated retrosternal clear space is not so helpfull anymore, since nowadays many patients are obese. In these patients the retrosternal space can be filled with fat.
Obliterated retrosternal clear space:
Describe the images on the left. Then continue. On the PA film there is a lobulated widening of the superior mediastinum. On the lateral chest film the retrosternal clear space is obliterated. This happened to be a patient with lymphoma. On the left FDG-PET images of the same patient. There are multiple lymphatic masses in the anterior, middle and even posterior mediastinum, spreading to the neck. Hilum Overlay Sign: hilar vessels are seen through a mediastinal mass
Hilum Overlay Sign:
When there is a mediastinal mass and you still can see the hilar vessels through this mass, then you know the mass does not arise from the hilum. This is known as the hilum overlay sign. Because of the geometry of the mediastinum most of these masses will be located in the anterior mediastinum. Describe the images on the left. Then continue. On the chest film there is a mass that has obtuse angles with the mediastinum, so it is a mediastinal mass. The hilar vessels are seen through this mass, so it does not arise from the hilum and probably will arise from the anterior mediastinum. The anterior location was confirmed on a CT. Most commonly this will be a mass of thymic or lymphatic origin. This proved to be a lymphoma in a HIV-positive patient.
Cystic masses:
The anterior mediastinum is an important location for cystic masses. Masses can be entirely cystic (thymic cysts) or have solid components (lymphoma or cystic thymoma). Some masses are cystic with enhancing septations - in these cases you should think of a germ cell tumor. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. The CT shows an anterior mediastinal mass with water density attenuation. This is typical for a thymic cyst. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. The CT shows a mass located in the anterior mediastinum. The mass is cystic but has solid enhancing septa. This finding is very specific for a germ cell tumor. Now many think that germ cell tumors contain fat and if a lesion does not contain fat, it cannot be a germ cell tumor. You have to remember, that only about 60 % of germ cell tumors contain fat, so you must realize that the absence of fat does not exclude a germ cell tumor from the differential diagnosis. The more solid components a germ cell tumor has, the more likely the tumor is to be malignant. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. The CT shows a mass located in the anterior mediastinum. The mass is cystic but has solid enhancing components, so we are worried about lymphoma, germ cell tumor and cystic thymoma. This proved to be a cystic thymoma.
Middle Mediastinum:
The middle mediastinum contains the following structures: lymph nodes, trachea, esophagus, azygos vein, vena cavae, posterior heart and the aortic arch. The majority of middle mediastinal masses will consist of foregut duplication cysts (eg oesophageal duplication or bronchogenic cysts) or lymphadenopathy. Aortic arch anomalies can also present as middle mediastinal masses. Fluid containing lesions are usually duplication cysts or necrotic lymph nodes. A pancreatic fluid collection due to pancreatitis may also present as a mediastinal mass. A fibrovascular esophageal polyp is a mesenchymal lesion which almost always contains fat. Vascular lesions are arch anomalies, azygos continuation due to interrupted inferior vena cava or hyperenhancing lymph nodes. On conventional radiographs look for the signs listed in the table on the left. Displaced azygoesophageal recess wiil be seen on the right. On the left you may have a pseudoparavertebral line. This is a new interface that looks like a paravertebral line. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. On the AP chest radiograph of this patient there is widening of the azygoesophageal recess on the right. There is an apparent widening of the paravertebral line on the left. On the lateral film the mass is anterior to the spine and therefore is located in the middle mediastinal. On the CT the azygoesophageal recess is displaced to the right due to oesophageal varices (blue arrow) and there is also a new interface on the left. This is a patient with cirrhosis of the liver and varices as a result of portal hypertension. On the left a patient with a small cell lung carcinoma. Describe the images on the left. Then continue. On the PA film there is a lobulated paratracheal stripe on the right. On the lateral radiograph there is a density overlying the ascending aorta and filling the retrosternal space. These findings indicate a mass in the anterior aswell as in the middle mediastinum. The CT confirms the presence oof lymphomas in both the anterior and the middle mediastinum. On the left two different patients. One of these patients has pulmonary hypertension and the other has sarcoidosis. Describe the images on the left. Then continue. On the right image there is a lobulated mass surrounding the right bronchus creating a 'doughnut' with the bronchus as the hole in the doughnut. On the left image there is only density in the area from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock and not in the 3 - 9 o'clock area. So the patient on the left has pulmonary hypertension with moderately enlarged vessels while the patient on the right has sarcoidosis with widespread lymphadenopathy. When there is a density in the 3 - 9 o'clock area, there should always be concern about mediastinal masses.
Posterior Mediastinum:
The posterior mediastinum contains the following structures: sympathetic ganglia, nerve roots, lymph nodes, parasympathetic chain, thoracic duct, descending thoracic aorta, small vessels and the vertebrae. Most masses in the posterior mediastinum are neurogenic in nature. These can arise from the sympathetic ganglia (eg neuroblastoma) or from the nerve roots (eg schwannoma or neurofibroma). Don't forget lymphadenopathy, the vertebrae and the descending thoracic aorta as potential causes for posterior mediastinal masses. Cystic lesions will be either neuroenteric cysts, schwannomas or meningoceles. Fat containing lesions will be extramedullary hematopoiesis. When the anemia is resolved the extramedullary marrow will stop producing blood and become fatty. On conventional radiographs look for:
Cervicothoracic sign:
The anterior mediastinum stops at the level of the superior clavicle. Therefore, when a mass extends above the superior clavicle, it is located either in the neck or in the posterior mediastinum. When lung tissue comes between the mass and the neck, the mass is probably in the posterior mediastinum. This is known as the Cervicothoracic Sign. If we study the image on the frontal view on the left, we see a mass extending above the level of the clavicle and there is lung tissue in front of it, so this must be a mass in the posterior mediastinum. On the left the MR of the same patient. It turned out to be a schwannoma. On the left images of a patient, who has a disease, that is the most commonly missed diagnosis in the emergency department resulting in the number one cause of law suits. Study the images and then continue. Notice the widening of the paravertebral stripes on both the left and the right on the PA radiograph. On the lateral radiograph there is a severely narrowed disc space. The diagnosis is discitis. On MR you will notice the edema of the soft tissues and the high signal intensity of the disc.
More than one compartment:
Since there are no tissue planes separating the mediastinal compartments, there are lesions that do not respect our approach to the mediastinum. These lesions tend to occupy more than one compartment and include: mediastinitis, hematomas, vascular entities, bronchogenic cancer, metastases and lymphangiomas (fluid containing).
Characterize:
Once you have localized a mediastinal mass, next try to charcterize it by assessing whether it has any of the following characteristics:
Fluid containing masses:
This is a list of mediastinal msses that may contain fluid: If a mass contains fluid it could be a teratoma (on the left) or a thymic cyst (on the right). Note that this teratoma does not contain fat. Teratomas are the most common benign germ cell tumors. The most common malignant germ cell tumor is the seminoma. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. There is are multiple masses in both the anterior and middle mediastinum. The attenuation values are of water density. These findings favor the diagnosis of cystic lymphadenopathy in a patient with metastatic disease. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. There is a cystic lesion in the middle mediastinum. There is a fluid fluid level with milk of calcium. Foregut duplication cysts occasionally contain milk of calcium like in this example of an esophageal duplication cyst.
Fat containing masses:
The differential diagnosis of fat containing mediastinal masses is: On the left we see an fat-containing anterior mediastinal mass. This is the typical finding of a fat-containing teratoma. Describe the image on the left. Then continue. The axial CT and sagittal MR demonstrate a lipomatous lesion within the lumen of the esophagus. This is typical for a esophageal lipoma and its fibrovascular stalk. Multiple enhancing lesions in multiple compartments

Chest X-Ray - Lung disease:

Four-Pattern Approach:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology Department of the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2014-02-01 On a chest x-ray lung abnormalities will either present as areas of increased density or as areas of decreased density. Lung abnormalities with an increased density - also called opacities - are the most common. A practical approach is to divide these into four patterns: In this article we will focus on this four-pattern approach. At the end we will also discuss diseases that present as areas of decreased density.
4-Pattern approach:
Whenever you see an area of increased density within the lung, it must be the result of one of these four patterns. Here are the most common examples of these four patterns on a chest x-ray (click image to enlarge). Consolidation Interstitial Reticular interstitial opacities You have to realize that it is not always possible to divide lung abnormalities into one of these four patterns, but that should not be a problem. Sometimes you are confronted with an abnormality that looks like a mass, but it could also be a consolidation. Just do the work-up of both the differential diagnosis of masses and consolidation. In such a case information from clinical data, old films or follow-up films and CT-scan will usually solve the problem. Finally in some cases only biopsy will provide a diagnosis.
Consolidation:
Consolidation is the result of replacement of air in the alveoli by transudate, pus, blood, cells or other substances. Pneumonia is by far the most common cause of consolidation. The disease usually starts within the alveoli and spreads from one alveolus to another. When it reaches a fissure the spread stops there. The key-findings on the X-ray are: Chronic diseases are indicated in red.
Differential diagnosis:
The table summarizes the most common diseases, that present with consolidation. Click to enlarge. Chronic diseases are indicated in red. A way to think of the differential diagnosis is to think of the possible content of the alveoli: Another way to think of consolidation, is to look at the pattern of distribution: Now it is obvious that some diseases can have more than one pattern. For instance a lobar pneumonia caused by streptococcus pneumoniae may become diffuse if the patient does not respond to the treatment. Other examples are organizing pneumonia (OP) and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. These diseases typically present as multifocal consolidations, but sometimes they may become diffuse. OP is organizing pneumonia. When it is idiopathic it is called cryptogenic (COP). The old name is BOOP - Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia. The new name for BAC - bronchoalveolar carcinoma is adenocarcinoma in situ. It is very important to differentiate between acute consolidation and chronic consolidation, because it will limit the differential diagnosis. In chronic disease we think of: This is known as alveolar sarcoidosis.
* Alveolar proteinosis is a rare chronic disease that is characterized by filling of the alveoli with proteinaceous material.
Lobar consolidation:
The most common presentation of consolidation is lobar or segmental. The most common diagnosis is lobar pneumonia. The table lists the differential diagnosis. Lobar pneumonia Here a typical lobar consolidation. First study the images, then continue reading. The findings are: Lobar consolidation is the result of disease that starts in the periphery and spreads from one alveolus to another through the pores of Kohn. At the borders of the disease some alveoli will be involved, while others are not, thus creating ill-defined borders. As the disease reaches a fissure, this will result in a sharp delineation, since consolidation will not cross a fissure. As the alveoli that surround the bronchi become more dense, the bronchi will become more visible, resulting in an air-bronchogram (arrow). In consolidation there should be no or only minimal volume loss, which differentiates consolidation from atelectasis. Expansion of a consolidated lobe is not so common and is seen in Klebsiella pneumoniae and sometimes in Streptococcus pneumoniae, TB and lung cancer with obstructive pneumonia. Lobar pneumonia Lobar pneumonia On the chest x-ray there is an ill-defined area of increased density in the right upper lobe without volume loss. The right hilus is in a normal position. Notice the air-bronchogram (arrow). In the proper clinical setting this is most likely a lobar or segmental pneumonia. However if this patient had weight loss or long standing symptoms, we would include the list of causes of chronic consolidation. This was an acute lobar pneumonia caused by Streptcoccus pneumoniae. Based on the images alone, it is usually not possible to determine the cause of the consolidation. Other things need to be considered, like acute or chronic illness, clinical data and other non-pulmonary findings. Here we have a number of x-rays with consolidation. Notice the similarity between these chest x-rays. Hemorrhage post-biopsy Hemorrhage In this case there was a solitary nodule in the right upper lobe and a biopsy was performed. The lobar consolidation is the result of hemorrhage as a complication of the procedure. Hemorrhage is seen in: Lunginfarction due to pulmonary emboli Lung infarction The radiographic features of acute pulmonary thromboembolism are insensitive and nonspecific. The most common radiographic findings in the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) study were atelectasis and patchy pulmonary opacity. In most cases of pulmonary emboli the chest x-ray is normal. This patient had pulmonary emboli, which were seen on a CECT. The peripheral consolidation is seen in the region of the emboli and can be attributed to hemorrhage in the infarcted area. Pulmonary sequestration Pulmonary sequestration This is an uncommon cause of lobar consolidation. It is a congenital abnormality. A nonfunctioning part of the lung lacks communication with the bronchial tree and receives arterial blood supply from the systemic circulation. Patients present with recurrent infection when bacteria migrate through the pores of Kohn. Notice the feeding artery, that branches off from the aorta (blue arrow).
Diffuse consolidation:
The most common cause of diffuse consolidation is pulmonary edema due to heart failure. This is also called cardiogenic edema, to differentiate it from the various causes of non-cardiogenic edema. The increased heart size is usually what distinguishes between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic. Look for other signs of heart failure like redistribution of pulmonary blood flow, Kerley B-lines and pleural fluid. However some patients, who have an acute cardiac infarction, may still have a normal heart size, while other patients who have a large heart due to a chronic heart disease, may have non-cardiac pulmonary edema due to a superimposed pulmonay infection, ARDS, near-drowning etc. Heart failure with diffuse perihilar pulmonary edema Congestive heart failure First study the images, then continue reading. The findings are: All these findings indicate, that we are dealing with pulmonary edema due to heart failure. You probably would like to look at old films to see if there are any changes. Bilateral legionella pneumonia Diffuse consolidation in bronchopneumonia Here another case of diffuse consolidation. This patient had fever and cough. This was thought to be a diffuse bronchopneumonia. Unlike lobar pneumonia, which starts in the alveoli, bronchopneumonia starts in the airways as acute bronchitis. It will lead to multifocal ill-defined densities. When it progresses it can produce diffuse consolidation. The disease does not cross the fissures, but usually starts in multiple segments. Bronchopneumonia can be caused by many micro-organisms. This proved to be legionella pneumonia. Diffuse consolidation in a patient with bronchoalveolar carcinoma Diffuse consolidation in bronchoalveolar carcinoma The chest x-ray shows diffuse consolidation with 'white out' of the left lung with an air-bronchogram. This patient had a chronic disease with progressive consolidation. The disease started as a persitent consolidation in the left lung and finally spread to the right lung. Final diagnosis: bronchoalveolar carcinoma. This is a difficult case. It demonstrates, that based on the x-ray alone, it is not certain which pattern we are looking at. Are these densities masses or consolidation? Continue with the CT. Non Hodgkin lymphoma The CT-image is not very helpful in the differentiation. There are hypodense areas, which could be masses. On the other hand this also could be areas of consolidation with hypodense areas due to necrosis. Finally the diagnosis non Hodgkin's disease was made based on biopsy. BatwingA bilateral perihilar distribution of consolidation is also called a Batwing distribution. The sparing of the periphery of the lung is attributed to a better lymphatic drainage in this area. It is most typical of pulmonary edema, both cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic. Sometimes it is seen in pneumonias. Reverse BatwingPeripheral or subpleural consolidation is called reverse Batwing distribution. It is frequently seen in chronic lung disease.
Multifocal:
Multifocal consolidations are also described as multifocal ill-defined opacities or densities. In most cases these are the result of airspace-consolidations due to bronchopneumonia. As mentioned before bronchopneumonia starts in the bronchi and then spreads into the lungparenchyma. This can lead to segmental, diffuse or multifocal ill-defined densities. In some cases however the underlying pathology of multiple ill-defined densities is interstitial disease, like in the alveolar form of sarcoidosis in which the granulomas are very small and fill up the alveoli. First study the chest x-ray. What are the findings and what is the differential diagnosis? Notice that there are multiple densities in both lungs. The larger ones are ill-defined and maybe there is an air-bronchogram in the right lower lobe. Probably we are dealing with multifocal consolidations, but one might also consider the possibility of multiple ill-defined masses. There is a peripheral distribution. This patient had a several month history of chronic non-productive cough, that did not respond to antibiotics. So we are dealing with the differential diagnosis of chronic consolidation. The lab-findings were normal which makes bronchoalveolar carcinoma and lymphoma less likely. There was no eosinophilia, which excludes eosinophilic pneumonia. Biopsy revealed the diagnosis of organizing pneumonia (OP) also known as BOOP. Wegener's granulomatosis Wegener's is a collagen vascular disease with vasculitis involving the lung, kidney and sinuses. In the lung the vasculitis causes infarcts which first present as ill-defined areas of consolidation. In a later stage these infarcts become more circumscribed and can be seen as multiple nodules or masses, sometimes with cavitation. Here a patient with non-specific findings. There are ill-defined densities in the right lung, which proved to be a manifestation of Wegener's.
Interstitial disease:

Differential diagnosis on HRCT:
Most of our knowledge about imaging findings in interstitial lung disease comes from HRCT. On HRCT there are four patterns: reticular, nodular, high and low attenuation (table). On a Chest X-Ray it can be very difficult to determine whether there is interstitial lung disease and what kind of pattern we are dealing with. On a CXR the most common pattern is reticular. The ground-glass pattern is frequently not detected on a chest x-ray. The cystic pattern is also difficult to appreciate on a cest x-ray. When the cysts have thick walls like in Langerhans cell histiocytosis or honeycombing, it frequently presents as a reticular pattern on a CXR. However sometimes an interstitial pattern can be seen and in many cases UIP can be suspected based on the x-ray findings. Cystic versus Reticular It can be difficult to determine whether we are dealing with a reticular pattern or a cystic pattern. The CXR is of a patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is called a cystic disease. On the CXR it is difficult to see if this is a cystic or a reticular pattern. In many of such cases a HRCT will give you more information. This problem is also seen in patients with UIP. One of the prominent findings in UIP is honeycombing. This creates a reticular pattern on the chest x-ray, because the cysts in honeycombing have thick walls. We will show a case in a moment. Reticular pattern in Congestive heart failure Study the images and then continue reading. The findings are: Based on these findings we can conclude that we are dealing with congestive heart failure. This is the most common interstitial pattern on a CXR. Interstitial edema usually presents as reticulation. Sometimes Kerley B lines are visible. Here another example. Kerley B lines are 1-2 cm long horizontal lines near the lateral pleura. The main differential diagnosis of Kerley B lines is: Here another chest x-ray with interstitial edema and Kerley B lines in a patient with congestive heart failure. The CT shows the septal thickening. Sometimes the reticulation is more coarse like in this case of congestive heart failure. Sarcoidosis In this case the chest x-ray shows subtle findings that could be described as fine reticulation. In many cases a HRCT is needed to determine the exact nature of the findings. The HRCT - not shown - demonstrated a fine nodular appearance as a result of sarcoidosis. Notice the subtle irregular thickening of the minor fissure. This is quite specific for sarcoidosis. Longstanding Sarcoidosis Here a typical chest film in a patient with long standing Sarcoidosis (stage IV). There is fibrosis in the upper zones. The differential diagnosis includes chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which also results in fibrosis with upper lobe predominance. The HRCT demonstrates densities in both upper lobes. These are called conglomerate masses, which are the result of conglomerates of nodules. Here another patient with sarcoidosis. The is volume loss in the upper lobes as a result of fibrosis. The image on the left also shows densities in the lung. On a HRCT fine nodules were seen. A follow-up CXR shows resorption of most of the lung abnormalities. The fibrosis persists.
UIP:
UIP is a histologic pattern of pulmonary fibrosis. On a chest X-ray UIP manifests as a reticular pattern particularly at the lung bases. In many cases you can suspect UIP on the CXR. A HRCT is needed to confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating honeycombing. Here a CXR with a reticular pattern at the lung bases. This pattern was first attributed to chronic congestive heart failure, but persisted on follow-up CXR's despite therapy. HRCT demonstrated honeycombing. Here another case. The CXR demonstrates a reticular interstitial pattern with a preference at the lung bases. The HRCT demonstrates honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. PCP
Interstitial pneumonias:
An acute reticular pattern is most frequently caused by interstitial edema due to cardiac heart failure. The other cause is interstitial pneumonia: This patient presented with a nonproductive cough and some fever. This was a PCP-infection as a first manifestation of AIDS. Sarcoidosis On a CXR sarcoidosis usually first presents with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (example). Parenchymal disease can present as consolidation or even as masses, but the most common presentation is a fine nodules. Here a typical case. When these small nodules coalesce, they may resemble consolidation. Lymphangitis carcinomatosis Lymphangitis carcinomatosis also produces a reticular pattern. It is best appreciated on HRCT-images.
Atelectasis:
Atelectasis or lung-collapse is the result of loss of air in a lung or part of the lung with subsequent volume loss due to airway obstruction or compression of the lung by pleural fluid or a pneumothorax. In many cases atelectasis is the first sign of a lung cancer. Evidently it is very important to recognize the various presentations of atelectasis, since some of them can be easily misinterpretated. The key-findings on the X-ray are:
Lobar atelectasis:
Lobar atelectasis or lobar collaps is an important finding on a chest x-ray and has a limited differential diagnosis. The most common causes of atelectasis are: Sometimes lobar atelectasis produces only mild volume loss due to overinflation of the other lungparts. The illustration summarizes the findings of the different types of lobar atelectasis. Right upper lobe atelectasis First study the images, then continue reading. Findings: On the PET-CT a lungneoplasm is seen with subsequent atelectasis of the right upper lobe due to obstruction of the upper lobe bronchus. A common finding in atelectasis of the right upper lobe is 'tenting' of the diafphragm (blue arrow). This patient had a centrally located lungcarcinoma with metastases in both lungs (red arrows). Right middle lobe atelectasis First study the x-rays and then continue reading. What are the findings? Usually right middle lobe atelectasis does not result in noticable elevation of the right diaphragm. A pectus excavatum can mimick a middle lobe atelectasis on a frontal view, but the lateral view should solve this problem. Right lower lobe atelectasis Chest x-rays of a 70-year old male who fell from the stairs and has severe pain on the right flank. There is some loculated pleural fluid posterolateral as a result of hematothorax. What are the pulmonary findings? First study the images, then continue reading. LEFT: Lower lobe atelectasis. RIGHT: Follow up. There is a right lower lobe atelectasis. Notice the abnormal right border of the heart. The right interlobar artery is not visible, because it is not surrounded by aerated lung but by the collapsed lower lobe, which is adjacent to the right atrium. On a follow-up chest film the atelectasis has resolved. We assume that the atelectasis was a result of post-traumatic poor ventilation with mucus plugging. Notice the reappearance of the right interlobar artery (red arrow) and the normal right heart border (blue arrow). Left upper lobe atelectasis First study the x-rays, then continue reading. What are the findings? The CT-images demonstrate the atelectasis of the left upper lobe (blue arrow). There is a centrally located mass which obstructs the left upper lobe bronchus (red arrow). First study the x-rays then continue reading. What are the findings and what sign is seen here? There is an atelectasis of the left upper lobe. You would not expect the apical region to be this dark, but in fact this is caused by overinflation of the lower lobe, which causes the superior segment to creep all the way up to the apical region. This is called the luft sichel sign. First study the x-rays, then continue reading. The findings are: These findings indicate a total atelectasis of the left upper lobe and possibly also partial atelectasis on the right. Since the silhouette of the right heart border is still visible, there is probably partial atelectasis of the lower lobe and not of the middle lobe. Continue with the PET-CT... Lungcarcinoma on the left obstructing the upper lobe bronchus and also a lung carcinoma on the right obstructing the right lower lobe. On the PET-CT there is both a tumor in the left lung, aswell as in the right. There were mutiple bone metastases. One rib metastasis is indicated by the arrow. Luft sichel means a sickle of air (blue arrow). Notice the bulging of the fissure on the lateral view. This is comparable to the golden-S sign in right upper lobe atelectasis and is suspective of a centrally obstructing mass. Study the images and then continue reading. There is a total collaps of the left upper lobe. Notice the high position of the left hilum. There is only a subtle band of density projecting behind the sternum. This is the collapsed upper lobe. In this case there is compensatory overinflation of the left lower lobe resulting in a normal position of the diaphragm and the mediastinum. Left lower lobe atelectasis First study the x-rays then continue reading. Where is the abnormality located? There is a triangular density seen through the cardiac shadow. This must be an abnormality located posterior to the heart. This is confirmed on the lateral view. The contour of the left diaphragm is lost when you go from anterior to posterior. As the title suggests this is lower lobe atelectasis. We cannot see the lower lobe vessels, because they are surrounded by the atelectatic lobe. Normally when you follow the thoracic spine form top to bottom, the lower region becomes less opaque. Here we have the opposite (blue arrow). Total atelectasis The chest x-ray shows total atelectasis of the right lung due to mucus plugging. Notice the displacement of the mediastinum to the right. Re-aeration on follow-up chest film after treatment with a suction catheter. The mediastinum has regained its normal position. A common cause of total atelectasis of a lung is a ventilation tube that is positioned too deep and thus obstructing one of the main bronchi. Total atelectasis in a patient with severe bronchopneumonia. These images are of a patient who had widespread bronchopneumonia and was on ventilation. During follow up a white out on the left was seen. This was caused by a large mucus plug. After suction of the mucus plug the left lung was re-aerated. The chest x-ray shows a nearly total opacification of the left hemithorax. This patient was known to have pleuritic carcinomatosis. The left lung is almost completely compressed by the pleural fluid. Unlike most of the above cases, which were caused by obstruction, in this case the atelectasis is a result of compression. The compression of the lung by the loculated fluid collections is best seen on the CT-image (blue arrow). The CT-scan was performed, because the patient was suspected of having pulmonary emboli (red arrow).
Rounded atelectasis:
The typical findings of rounded atelectasis on CT are pleural thickening, pleural-based mass and comet tail sign. The theory is that a local pleuritis causes the pleura to thicken and contract. The underlying lung shrinks and atelectasis develops in a round configuration. The distorted vessels appear to be pulled into the mass and resemble a comet tail (4). First study the images and then continue reading. On the lateral view there is a mass-like lesion that is pleural-based. The first impresson is, that this is a pleural lesion. A CT was performed - see next images. Rounded atelectasis The CT shows a lesion that originates in the lung. Many would have a lungcancer on the top of their differential diagnostic list. However there is also some pleural thickening (red arrow) and vessels seem to swirl around the mass (blue arrows). This is also described as the comet tail sign (4). Whenever you see a pleural-based lesion that looks like a lungcancer, also consider the possibility of rounded atelectasis. Rounded atelectasis is a benign lesion and when the findings are convincing, then biopsy is not needed. During follow up these lesions usually do not change in configuration. Rounded atelectasis is frequently seen in patients with a history of asbest exposure. The images show a density posteriorly in the left lower lobe. On the PA-film this looks like a mass or possibly a consolidation. On the lateral film however the boundaries seem to be sharp, which is in favor of a mass. Also notice that the pleura is thickened (red arrow). Although a peripheral lungcancer is on top of our list, we now also consider the possibility of rounded atelectasis. Rounded atelectasis The CT-images show the typical features of a rounded atelectasis. There is an oval mass, pleural thickening and a comet tail sign (arrow). This lesion did not change in a two-year follow up. Plate-like atelectasis due to poor inspiration in a patient who had abdominal surgery Plate-like atelectasis Plate-like atelectasis is a common finding on chest x-rays and detected almost every day. They are characterized by linear shadows of increased density at the lung bases. They are usually horizontal, measure 1-3 mm in thickness and are only a few cm long. In most cases these findings have no clinical significance and are seen in smokers and elderly. They are seen in patients, that are in a poor condition and who breathe superficially, for instance after abdominal surgery (figure). Plate-like atelectasis in a patient with pulmonary embolism Plate-like atelectasis is frequently seen in patients in the ICU due to poor ventilation. Platelike atelectasis is also frequently seen in pulmonary embolism, but since it is non-specific, it is not a helpful sign in making the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Cicacitration atelectasis Atelectasis can be the result of fibrosis of lungtissue. This is seen after radiotherapy and in chronic infection, especially TB. Here we have a patient who was treated with radiotherapy for lungcancer. Notice the increased density of the lung tissue and the volume loss. Here we have a patient with atelectasis of the right upper lobe as a result of TB. Notice the deviation of the trachea. There is also some atelectasis of the left upper lobe, which results in a high position of the left pulmonary artery as seen on the lateral view (red arrow)
Nodules and Masses:

Solitary Pulmonary Nodule:
Click here for more detailed information about Solitary Pulmonary Nodule A solitary pulmonary nodule or SPN is defined as a discrete, well-marginated, rounded opacity less than or equal to 3 cm in diameter. It has to be completely surrounded by lung parenchyma, does not touch the hilum or mediastinum and is not associated with adenopathy, atelectasis or pleural effusion. The differential diagnosis of SPN is basically the same as of a mass except that the chance of malignancy increases with the size of the lesion. Lesions smaller than 3 cm, i.e. SPN's are most commonly benign granulomas, while lesions larger than 3 cm are treated as malignancies until proven otherwise and are called masses. The tabel is adapted from chest x-ray - a survival guide. In lesions that do not respond to antibiotics, probably the most important non-invasive diagnostic tool is nowadays the PET-CT. PET-CT can detect malignancy in focal pulmonary lesions of greater than 1 cm with a sensitivity of about 97% and a specificity of 78%. False-positive findings in the lung are seen in granulomatous disease and rheumatoid disease. False negatives are seen in low grade malignant tumors like carcinoid and alveolar cell carcinoma and lesions of less than 1 cm. Click to enlarge the table
Fleischner Society recommendations for follow-up of nodules:
Previous chest radiographs should be reviewed to determine if the lesion has been stable over 2 years. If so, no further follow up is necessary, with the exception of pure ground-glass lesions on CT scans, which can be slower growing. For lesions with a benign pattern of calcification, further testing is not necessary. Management of indeterminate lesions greater than 8-10 mm depends on clinical probability of malignancy, as follows: Any unequivocal growth noted during follow up means that a definitive tissue diagnosis is needed.
Multiple masses:
The differential diagnostic list of multiple masses is very long. The most important diagnoses are listed in the table. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate multifocal consolidations from masses. Metastases Metastases are the most common cause of multiple pulmonary masses. Usually they vary in size and are well-defined. They predominate in the lower lobes and in the subpleural region. HRCT will demonstrate the random distribution unlike other diseases that have a perilymphatic or centrilobular distribution. The images show a renal cell carcinoma that has invaded the inferior vena cava with subsequent spread of disease to the lungs. Metastases in a patient with a head-neck cancer Here another patient with widespread pulmonary metastases of a cancer, that was located in the tongue. Mucoid impaction
Mucoid impaction:
Mucus plugs or mucoid impaction can mimick the appearance of lung nodules or a mass. Sometimes differentiating mucus impaction from a lungcancer can be difficult. Mucoid impaction is commonly seen in patients with bronchiectasis, as in cystic fibrosis (CF) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ABPA is a hypersensitivity disorder induced by Aspergillus, that occurs in patients with asthma or CF. It is also seen in bronchial obstruction caused by an obstructing tumor or bronchial atresia. In this case there are some mass-like structures in the right lung. CT demonstrated bronchiectasis with mucoid impaction. A more common presentation of mucoid impaction in seen here. This is the typical 'finger-in-glove' appearance of mucoid impaction. The mucus in the dilated bronchi looks like the fingers in a glove. Bronchial atresia Bronchial atresia Bronchial atresia is a congenital abnormality resulting from interruption of a bronchus with associated peripheral mucus impaction and associated hyperinflation of the obstructed lung (10). The hyperinflation of the affected lungsegment is caused by collateral ventilation through the pores of Kohn. The characteristic finding is a hyperlucent area of the lung surrounding a branching or nodular opacity that extends from the hilum. Notice the central mass surrounded by hyperlucent lung (blue arrow).
Decreased density or lucencies:
Radiologists use many terms to describe areas of decreased density or lucencies within the lung, like cyst, cavity, pneumatocele, emphysema, bulla, honeycombing, bleb etc. Many of these terms are based on the pathogenesis of the abnormality. This makes it difficult to use these terms, since in many cases when we describe a chest X-ray, we are trying to figger out what the pathology could be. A more practical approach is to describe areas of decreased density in the lung as: Cavities frequently arise within a mass or an area of consolidation as a result of necrosis. We will discuss them here, because the prominent feature is the lucency. In the differential diagnosis there is overlap between cavities and cysts. Cavities can heal and end up as lungcysts and lungcysts can become infected and turn into thick walled cavities. Sometimes emphysematous bullae have visible walls that measure less than 1 mm. To differentiate them from cysts, is to look at the surrounding lung parenchyma. Cysts occur without associated pulmonary emphysema. Cysts usually contain air, but occasionally contain fluid or solid material. The term is mostly used to describe enlarged thin-walled airspaces in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis or Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Thicker-walled honeycomb cysts are seen in patients with end-stage fibrosis (11). Pneumonia with cavitation
Cavitation:
Pneumonia In virulent pyogenic infections an abscess may form within the consolidated lung as a result of necrosis due to vasculitis and thrombosis. When some of the pus is coughed up, a cavity can be seen on the chest film. These patients are usually very ill. In granulomatous infection like TB, cavities may form, but these patients are usually not that ill. Cavitation is not seen in viral pneumonia, mycoplasma and rarely in streptococcus pneumoniae. These images are of a young patient with pneumonia. No micro-organism could be isolated. Within one month after treatment with antibiotics, there was almost complete resolution of the consolidation and the cavity. Pneumonia with cavitation. Minimal changes at follow up. Pneumonia Here another example of a pneumonia with cavitation. Notice the destruction of lung parenchyma as seen on the CT. At one year follow up only minimal changes are seen on the CXR. Postprimary TB with cavities TB Primairy TB is usually clinically silent. In 5% of infected individuals the immunity is inadequate and clinically active disease develops, which is known as progressive primary disease (9). Postprimary TB is reactivation of the latent infection and occurs in 5% of infected patients. On the CXR it is seen as consolidation with cavitation in the apical segments of the upper and lower lobes. Miliary TB is the result of hematogenous spread. Here a patient with postprimary TB with cavitaty formation in the left upper lobe. Postprimary TB TB This patient presented first with the CXR on the left. First study the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: We can assume that this is reactivation of a latent TB. Culture was positive for TB. A CXR some years later on the right shows: This is better appreciated on a CT. Continue... Same patient Notice the cavitation especially on the right. In the left upper lobe there is probably some traction-bronchiectasis due to the fibrosis. Nontuberculous mycobacteria pneumonia with cavitation Nontuberculous mycobacteria Nontuberculous mycobacteria, also known as atypical mycobacteria, are all the other mycobacteria which can cause pulmonary disease resembling TB. Here a patient with active disease in both upper lobes due to infection with atypical mycobacterium. Notice the air-fluid level indicating pus within the cavity (arrow). Nontuberculous mycobacteria infection with cavitation Here another patient with a mycobacterium infection. Notice the nodules with cavitation. Continue with the CT-images. Nontuberculous mycobacteria infection with cavitation Same patient with nontuberculous mycobacteria infection. Multiple small cavities are seen. Septic emboli Septic emboli usually present as multiple ill-defined nodules. In about 50% cavitation is seen. CT demonstrates more lesions than the chest film and can suggest the diagnosis in the proper clinical setting by demonstrating wegde-shaped peripheral lesions abutting the pleura, air-bronchograms within the ill-defined nodules and a feeding vessel sign (7). Some argue whether there is really something like a feeding vessel sign (8). Here a patient with septic emboli. The chest film shows two ill-defined densities iin the left lung, which are probably consolidations. On the CT cavitation is seen and another density with cavitation in the right lung. Continue with folluw up film. Septic emboli Same patient. On a follow up CXR only a small lungcyst is seen. Lungcancer 10% of lungcancers cavitate, most commonly squamous cell carcinoma. Small cell lungcancer does not cavitate. Bronchoalveolar carcinoma, or now called adenocarcinoma in situ, may occasionally cavitate and sometimes present as multiple lesions. Here a chest x-ray of a large cavitating lung cancer, which started as a small mass. Pulmonary embolism resulting in an infarcted area. Lung infarction In pulmonar embolism it is not common to see consolidation. The consolidation is a result of lunginfarction and bleeding into the alveoli. In this case a lung cyst has formed in the infarcted area. Here we see an old chest film, which is normal. The pulmonary embolus has caused a triangular density on the chest film (arrow). On the CT we can see, that it is a segmental consolidation. Continue with the follow up films. Cavitation in pulmonary embolism Lung infarction Same patient. On follow up films first a cyst is seen. One year later there is a thick wall probably as a result of secondary infection.
Pneumatocele:
The term pneumatocele is used to describe a lungcyst, which is most frequently caused by acute pneumonia, trauma, or aspiration of hydrocarbon fluid and is usually transient. The mechanism is believed to be a combination of parenchymal necrosis and check-valve airway obstruction (11). The illustration shows a pneumatocele as a result of a trauma. When it fills with fluid, it may resemble a solitary pulmonar nodule. by Richard Webb and Charles Higgins

Introduction:
View larger version
17 segments model:
Myocardial segments with abnormal enhancement or wall motion disturbances are named and localized according to the 17 segments model of the American Heart Association (37). Individual myocardial segments can be assigned to the 3 major coronary arteries with the recognition that there is anatomic variability. 17 segments model (2) basal anterolateral mid anterior mid anterolateral apical anterior apical lateral apex Click for larger version
Enhancement patterns:
Administration of Gadolinium results in uptake of the contrast agent into both normal and injured myocardium. In normal myocardium there will be early wash out of contrast. In injured myocardium the wash out is very slow resulting in delayed enhancement after 10 - 15 minutes compared to the normal myocardium. Delayed enhancement of myocardial tissue is seen in many pathophysiologic scenarios: LEFT: Long axis late enhancement image in a patient with an inferior wall infarction with subendocardial enhancement in the territory of the right coronary artery RIGHT: 4-chamber late enhancement image in a patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with midmyocardial enhancement
Ischemic versus non-ischemic:
The causes of cardiomyopathy (CM) can be divided into ischemic and non-ischemic (1-5). Ischemic CM
 is defined as dysfunction of the left ventricle as a result of a chronic lack of oxygen due to coronary artery disease. Delayed enhancement MR images will show fibrosis, which appears as high signal intensity in an area of coronary artery distribution. Since all infarctions start subendocardially and may progress to transmural, the subendocardial region is always involved. Non-ischemic CM 
 has a variable etiology, i.e. genetic, toxic, metabolic, infectious and idiopathic. In nonischemic myocardial disease the delayed enhancement usually does not occur in a coronary artery distribution and is often midwall or epicardial rather than subendocardial or transmural.
Ischemic Cardiomyopathy:
Left: subendocardial infarction, Right: transmural infarction
Infarction and delayed enhancement:
Infarcted myocardium is bright on late-enhancement images. All patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy demonstrate delayed enhancement in a typical 'CAD' pattern, one in which the subendocardium is always involved. When a coronary artery is occluded the infarction always starts subendocardially and progresses towards the epicardium depending on the duration of the occlusion [6]. Both acute and chronic infarctions enhance. In acute infarctions the contrast enters the damaged myocardial cells due to myocyte membrane disruption. In chronic infarctions the late enhancement is a result of retention of contrast material in the large interstitial space between the collagen fibers in the fibrotic tissue [7]. Left: no-reflow phenomenonRight: four months later there is transmural enhancement indicating a transmural infarction
No reflow phenomenon:
No reflow phenomenon is the failure of blood to reperfuse an ischemic area after the physical obstruction has been removed or bypassed. No reflow zones are identified on late-enhancement images as a dark core surrounded by an enhancing rim. This finding indicates the presence of damaged microvasculature in the core of an area of infarction The presence of a 'no reflow' zone is associated with worse functional outcome, larger infarcts and adverse clinical outcome [8,9]. Both acute and chronic infarctions demonstrate delayed-enhancement, but an acute infarction can often be distinguished by the presence of a 'no reflow' zone and high signal on T2 weighted images.
Stunning:
Cine imaging in combination with delayed-enhancement MR allows identification of: Stunning is defined as postischemic myocardial dysfunction that persists despite restoration of normal blood flow. Over time there can be a gradual return of contractile function depending on the transmurality of the ischemia [10]. If the degree of transmurality as seen on the delayed enhancement images is less than 50%, the myocardial function is likely to recover [11]. On the left a long axis cine 6 days after revascularization of an acute inferior wall infarction. First study the video and then continue reading. Continue with the delayed enhancement image. Long axis late enhancement image 6 days after revascularized acute inferior wall infarction On the left the long axis delayed enhancement image of the same patient. There is less than 50% enhancement of the myocardium. This is a good prognostic sign and we can expect a restoration of some of the contractile function. Continue with the cine-view four months later. On the left the same patient four months after the inferior infarction and revascularization. First study the video and then continue reading. The long axis cine shows improved function of the inferior wall. Now it can be concluded that the hypokinesia was due to stunning. Myocardial regions that demonstrate little or no evidence of hyperenhancement (i.e. infarction) have a high likelihood of recovery, whereas regions with transmural hyperenhancement have virtually no chance of recovery.
Hibernation:
Hibernation is a state in which some segments of the myocardium exhibit abnormalities of contractile function at rest [10]. This phenomenon is highly significant clinically because it usually manifests itself in the setting of chronic ischemia, that is potentially reversible by revascularization.
The reduced coronary blood flow causes the myocytes to enter a low-energy 'sleep mode' to conserve energy. There is an inverse relationship between the transmural extent of hyperenhancement, and the likelihood of wall motion recovery following revascularization. If the transmural extent of late enhancement is less than 50% the function is likely to improve after revascularization [12]. On the left long axis cine-images of a patient with a severe stenosis of the LAD. First study the video and then continue reading. The cine images show: Continue with the late enhancement image. Hibernation of the anterior wall (blue arrow) and old transmural inferior wall infarction (yellow arrow). On the left the long axis late enhancement image in the same patient. Noice the following: So it can be concluded, that this is probably the result of hibernation. After PTCA there is improvement of the function of the anterior wall. The ejection fraction improved from 17 to 49%.
Non Ischemic cardiomyopathy:
Non Ischemic cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of other causes of heart dysfunction, like coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease. We will discuss the cardiomyopathies listed in the table on the left. HCM with narrow left ventricular outflow tract (yellow arrow), systolic anterior motion of anterior leaflet of mitral valve (blue arrow) and mitral regurgitation (red arrow)
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by a hypertrophied left ventricle, defined as diastolic wall thickness 15mm or more, without any identifiable cause such as hypertension or valvular disease. Normal ventricular septal measurement is 8-12 mm. Usually there is asymmetric thickening of the wall most prominently involving the ventricular septum without abnormal enlargement of the ventricular cavities. It is a genetic myocardial disorder with a prevalence of 1:500. In about 25% of patients there is obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) due to hypertrophy of the basal septum and a systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM). In these cases the term HOCM or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is used.
The systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is probably the result of the increased flow velocity and decreased pressure above the valve caused by the hypertrophied interventricular septum (the Venturi effect). In the vast majority of patients the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valva is the mechanism of obstruction in HCM and also the cause of the mitral regurgitation. On an end-systolic image the following findings can be depicted (figure): HOCM with hypertrophic basal septum. HOCM (2) On the left an end-diastolic image. The arrow points to the hypertrophic basal septum. Continue with the 3-chamber view movie. On the left the 3-chamber view movie of the same patient. First study the video and then continue reading. The video nicely demonstrates: Left: 3-chamber late enhancement image shows the enhancement of the hypertrophic basal septum (arrow) HOCM (3) On the far left a 3-chamber late enhancement image which nicely demonstrates the enhancement of the hypertrophic basal septum (arrow). Next to it a short axis late enhancement image which demonstrates the typical enhancement at the anterior and posterior right ventricular insertion points (arrows). 3-chamber late enhancement image before (left) and after (right) alcohol ablation. Note the transmural infarction of the basal septum (arrow). The therapy of HOCM is pharmacological, surgical myotomy or alcohol ablation [15]. The results of the alcohol ablation are very well depicted with MRI [19]. On the left a 3-chamber late enhancement image before and after alcohol ablation. Note the transmural infarction of the basal septum (arrow). Continue with the 3-chamber movie pre-alcohol ablation. HOCM (4) On the left a 3-chamber movie of the same patient before the alcohol ablation. Notice the systolic anterior movement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and the mitral regurgitation. On the left the 3-chamber movie post-alcohol ablation with thinning of the basal septum and normalization of the function of the mitral valve.
Restrictive cardiomyopathy - Amyloidosis:
The most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy is amyloidosis [20]. 
Amyloid deposits in the myocardium cause abnormal diastolic function with biatrial enlargement, concentric thickening of the left ventricle and reduced systolic function of usually both ventricles. Cardiac involvement in systemic amyloidosis occurs in up to 50% and has a poor prognosis with a median survival of 6 months [3]. On the left a 4-chamber movie of a patient with amyloidosis. There is diffuse hypokinesia of the left and right ventricle. Same patient, short axis movie. Amyloidosis: late enhancement Late enhancement image shows enhancement over the entire subendocardial circumference, variably extending into the neighboring myocardium [21]. 
Sometimes it is difficult to find the optimal inversion time for nulling the normal myocardium [1]. On the left the 4-chamber and short axis late enhancement images. There is circumferential subendocardial enhancement extending into the neighboring myocardium. Axial and coronal black-blood images of a patient with constrictive pericarditis after CABG. Arrows point to the thickened pericardium.
Constrictive cardiomyopathy:
The most important differential diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy is constrictive cardiomyopathy. MRI can differentiate between those two diagnoses: On the left the 4-chamber movie in a patient with constrictive CM. Notice the diastolic septal bounce which is typical for constrictive cardiomyopathy. Same patient, short axis movie.
Dilated cardiomyopathy:
Dilated cardiomyopathy is defined as dilatation with an end diastolic diameter greater than 55mm measured on the left ventricular outflow image and an ejection fraction < 40%. Patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy show either no enhancement or linear midmyocardial enhancement [24]. This enhancement is explained by the presence of fibrosis. This indicates a poorer prognosis. Patients with midmyocardial enhancement are at higher risk of sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias [25]. On the left a 4-chamber view of a patient with idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Notice the mitral regurgitation. Continue with the late enhancement image. The late enhancement image does not show any enhancement. This is compatible with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (2) The differentiation between idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is important, as ischemic cardiomyopathy might be treated with revascularization and idiopathic disease not. Late enhancement MRI will show subendocardial enhancement in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. On the left a 4-chamber movie of a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy. Continue with the late enhancement image. Late enhancement image in a patient with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy . Note the characteristic subendocardial enhancement. The late enhancement MRI shows subendocardial enhancement in this patient. So we can conclude that this is dilated cardiomyopathy as a result of ischemia. Dilated cardiomyopathy (3) In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy it is important to determine the ejection fraction. According to the guidelines of ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 [26] there is an indication for an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) if: On the left the 4-chamber view of a patient with the idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The ejection fraction was measured to be 28%. Same patient with the idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy: short axis view. Notice the poor contraction. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with midwall septal enhancement, consistent with fibrosis On the left the late enhancement images of the same patient. There is midmyocardial septal enhancement consistent with fibrosis. Left: fatty infiltration in the myocardium of the anterior wall of the dilated right ventricle (arrows) Right: dilated right ventricular outflow tract with micro-aneurysm (arrow).
ARVC:
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited cardiomyopathy whose hallmark is fibrofatty replacement of the RV myocardium. The left ventricle is also involved in at least 15% of patients. The patients develop progressive RV failure and present with ventricular arrhythmias which can cause sudden cardiac death especially in young people. Morphologically the right ventricle can have regional wall thinning, hypertrophy, dilatation and microaneurysms. 
Functionally  cine images are evaluated for RV dysfunction, microaneurysm formation, and focal areas of RV dyskinesia. MR scans may be overinterpreted since the RV has substantial normal variations including variable trabeculation and small outward bulges near the insertion of the moderator band. On the left axial black-blood images of a patient with fatty ARVC. There are two variants of ARVC: fatty and fibro-fatty. The fatty form is characterized by fatty replacement of the myocardium without thinning of the ventricular wall. The fibro-fatty form is associated with significant thinning of the right ventricular wall. The sites of involvement are mostly found in the subtricuspid area, the right ventricular apex, and the infundibulum, the 'triangle of dysplasia' [4]. On the left a 4-chamber movie in a patient with ARVC.
Notice the dilated right ventricle with severe segmental hypo- and dyskinesis resulting in small aneurysms. On the left a short axis movie in a patient with ARVC. Notice the dilated right ventricle with severe segmental dyskinesis resulting in small aneurysms. Left: axial black-blood image of a patient with fibro-fatty ARVC Right: late enhancement image shows enhancement of the anterior wall of the right ventricle (arrow). ARVC (2) MRI can show segmental hypokinesis, dilatation, fatty infiltration in the right ventricular myocardium, small aneurysms and late enhancement of the myocardium [5,27]. Fat infiltration is seldom the only abnormality seen on MRI in ARVC, it should coincide with right ventricular regional dysfunction [28]. The diagnosis ARVC cannot be made on MRI findings alone. On the left a 4-chamber movie of a patient with ARVC. There is a dilated right ventricle with severe segmental hypokinesis and dyskinesis. ARVC (3) The diagnosis is based on major and minor Task Force criteria, many of which involve clinical and laboratory information [29]. Major criteria demonstrated by MRI are: Minor criteria shown by MRI include [27] : Myocarditis: midmyocardial enhancement
Myocarditis:
Myocarditis is often caused by a viral infection. Acute myocarditis can be a cause of sudden cardiac death. Most patients spontaneously recover, however 5-10% of the patients will develop a dilated cardiomyopathy [30]. Acute myocarditis may clinically mimic an acute myocardial infarction with chest pain. Abnormal laboratory findings and ECG changes may also suggest an acute coronary syndrome. The MRI findings however are discriminatory between those two diagnoses. The late enhancement images are key, as the late enhancement in myocarditis is subepicardially or midmyocardially located, and does not originate from the subendocardium [30]. On the left a patient with myocarditis. Notice the midmyocardial enhancement of the lateral wall. Myocarditis: 10 months later the midmyocardial enhancement of the lateral wall has diminished. Same patient with myocarditis. Notice that the midmyocardial enhancement of the lateral wall has diminished. Myocarditis (2) Most lesions with myocarditis occur in the lateral free wall. Wall motion abnormalities may or may not be present. There is a potential relationship between the location of late enhancement, the etiologic virus and the prognosis [31]. On the left a patient with myocarditis. The 4-chamber movie demonstrates hypokinesia of the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Continue with the movie 10 months later. 4-chamber movie 10 months later. The lateral wall is now normokinetic. LEFT: Octopus pot RIGHT: left ventricle angiogram in a patient with Tako tsubo cardiomyopathy. There is only contraction of the basal segments (blue arrows) and the mid- and apical segments balloon.
Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy:
Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning syndrome is a transient cardiomyopathy affecting postmenopausal women after physical or emotional stress. Patients present with symptoms mimicking an acute myocardial infarction. The ECG changes and abnormal laboratory findings may also mimic an infarction. However, coronary angiography is usually normal, but if a left ventricle angiogram is performed, marked hypokinesia of the apical cardiac segments is noted (figure). The Japanese word takotsubo means octopus pot. This pot was used to capture octopus and resembles the shape of the left ventricle during systole in these patients These apical wall motion abnormalities are well seen with MRI. The motion abnormalities are transient and return to normal within weeks. On the left a patient with Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy. Notice the hypokinesia of the apex. The apical wall motion abnormalities were transient and returned to normal within weeks. Continue with the late enhancement image. Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy: no late enhancement Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (2) Typically there is no late enhancement, which distinguishes it from an infarction [4]. The pathogenesis is unknown, but it is probably caused by the release of catecholamines. The modified Mayo Clinic criteria for diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy: Absence of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis. Mahrholdt H, Wagner A, Judd RM, Sechtem U, Kim RJ.

Acute Abdomen in Neonates:
Joosje Bomer, Samuel Stafrace, Robin Smithuis and Herma Holscher
Akershus Universitetssykehus in Lørenskog, Norway, Sidra Medicine in Doha, Qatar, Alrijne hospital in Leiden and Juliana Children's Hospital in the Hague, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2018-05-01 A neonate with an acute abdomen usually presents with vomiting, constipation and distention of the belly. When the symptoms are present immediately after birth, the most common cause is a gastrointestinal obstruction. In this article we will discuss the congenital gastrointestinal obstructions and also some acquired diseases that present as an acute abdomen in the neonate.
Differential diagnosis:
The table on the left lists the differential diagnosis for acute abdomen in the neonate. High obstructions are defined as proximal to the ileum. Low obstructions are defined as occuring in the ileum or colon. Although in high obstruction vomiting will be the most striking symptom, whereas in low obstruction this will be constipation, both symptoms are often present concurrently, and the clinical differentiation between a high and a low obstruction is difficult. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are the most common acquired causes of an acute abdomen in the neonate. NEC is most common in prematures, especially when there is an extreme low birthweight. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents at the age of 4-8 weeks, but can sometimes present in the early neonatal period.
Imaging:

Abdominal radiograph:
In suspected neonatal obstruction the first step is an abdominal radiograph. On the radiograph an obstruction can only be diagnosed if the bowel has had sufficient time to become air-filled after birth. The table shows the normal progression of air in the gastrointestinal tract. The things to look for on the abdominal radiograph are listed in the table. We will discuss each of these items separately. In addition to the front view, the dorsal decubitus radiograph (cross-table view with horizontal beams) should be performed, which can depict free air and sometimes can aid in differentiating the small intestine from the colon. On the radiograph also check lines and catheters and study the lungs, soft tissues and skeletal structures. Calcifications in the abdominal wall can be seen in meconium peritonitis.
1. Dilatation?:
When the bowel measures more than the interpedicular width of L2, it is said to be dilated. Massive dilatation is seen in complete obstruction and is accompanied by fluid levels on the dorsal decubitus radiograph. However, fluid levels alone do not necessarily correspond to dilatation, but rather reflect abnormal peristalsis. An unchanging bowel gas pattern over time indicates absence of perstalsis. On the left image the bowel is dilated and the diameter exceeds L2 interpedicular width in a patient with meconium ileus. On the image on the right there is massive dilatation in a neonate with jejunal atresia.
2. Number of dilated loops?:
Up til three dilated small bowel loops on an abdominal radiograph generally indicate a high obstruction. The left image shows a case of jejunal atresia. More than three dilated loops indicate a low obstruction. The image on the right is a case of ileal atresia.
3. Small bowel or colon?:
Since neonates do not have haustra in the colon yet, it is often impossible to discriminate between small bowel and colon on an AP radiograph. A dorsal decubitus radiograph may help as colonic obstruction may produce long fluid levels. Furthermore, the colon ascendens, descendens and rectum are more dorsally located structures. To discriminate small bowel from large bowel with certainty is only possible with a colon enema.
4. Airfilled rectum?:
If sufficient time has gone by after birth, the rectum will be filled with air. Absence of rectal air indicates an obstruction. In Hirschsprung's disease there is usually no air in the rectum or only a thin stripe of air. The image shows a neonate with dilated bowel loops. There is no air in the rectum. This patient had a meconium ileus. Enable Scroll

5. Pneumatosis intestinalis?:
Study the image. What are the findings? Then scroll to the next image. Findings: Pneumatosis intestinalis is defined as gas in the bowel wall. In neonates it is seen in bowel wall ischemia in necrotizing enterocolitis. On the radiograph pneumatosis intestinalis resembles granular feces, which is a normal finding in older children. Neonates however do not have granular feces yet since they only drink milk. So what looks like granular feces in the bowel actually represents intramural gas. The air bubbles can be resorbed into the venous system causing portal venous gas. Pneumatosis intestinalis can lead to perforation seen as pneumoperitoneum.
6. Free air and ascites?:
Large amounts of free air can be seen on the front radiograph under the diaphragms, when visualizing both sides of the bowel wall and outlining the falciform ligament. Small amounts of free air can only be detected on the dorsal decubitus radiograph. Ascites can only be suspected on a radiograph when the amounts are large enough to cause the bowel to float and cluster in the center of the abdomen. The presence of both ascites, free air as well as abdominal wall calcifications indicate that there has been a perforation in utero with meconium peritonitis.
Upper GI study:
In case of a typical complete high obstruction (see below) on the radiograph no further imaging is needed and upper GI series are not advised as they may only cause aspiration. When the obstruction is incomplete or imaging results are equivocal, an upper GI is indicated. First aspirate air from a distended air-filled stomach. Always use water-soluble contrast in neonates and inject slowly. Do not distend the stomach too much. Look for dilatation and stenosis and document the position of Treitz' ligament. To correctly depict Treitz' ligament, the child has to lie flat and straight as rotation may falsely simulate malrotation. If you do not plan to take more images later, aspirate the injected contrast from the stomach at the end of the examination. Here an upper GI study showing the normal position of Treitz' ligament to the left of the spine (arrow). It reaches as high as the bulbus duodeni or even higher. In malrotation, which we will discuss later, Treitz is positioned to the right of the spine. Microcolon: elongated colon with smalldiameter. It indicates that meconium has not reached the colon yet. Once the obstruction is relieved and bowel contents pass through the colon, the colon will develop normally without remaining consequences.
Colon enema:
In cases of suspected low obstruction, a colon enema is indicated. Use water-soluble contrast for two reasons: the thick barium can make the evacuation of meconium even more troublesome and water-soluble contrast can be an effective therapeutic enema in cases of meconium plugging or meconium ileus. You may choose to use a balloon catheter, but do not distend the balloon prior to evaluating the rectum and excluding Hirschsprung disease, as the high pressure from the balloon can cause a rectal perforation! In experienced hands a balloon can be inflated if this is deemed necessary to reach complete filling and do this under careful fluoroscopic vision. Lateral images from the rectum and sigmoid should be documented first followed by frontal images. Focus on the diameter of the rectum versus the remainder of the colon, the presence of a microcolon and meconium pellets. In Hirschsprung disease it is sufficient to determine the length of the affected bowel, but in other conditions one should aim for filling of the terminal ileum, as the obstruction can be located in the ileum.
Ultrasound:
Ultrasound plays a limited role in depicting GI tract pathology as the gas-filled bowel will strongly reflect the ultrasound beam. There are however some exceptions. Here ultrasound images of a neonate who presented with an acute abdomen. An ultrasound antenatally had detected a duplication cyst. On the ultrasound there is a whirlpool sign of the vessels. Torsion of the cyst and the mesentery had resulted in a volvulus. This is a medical emergency and consequently the neonate went straight to the operating room.
Congenital High Obstruction:
Most high obstructions occur at the level of the duodenum. Vomiting will be non-bilious if the obstruction is localized proximal to the Vater ampulla, and bilious (the color or which is green) if it is localized distal to it. Bilious vomiting is an indication for urgent imaging as a volvolus may be present.
Esophageal atresia:
First look at the image and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are: Diagnosis: esophagus atresia with a distal tracheo-esophageal fistula Esophagus atresia is an anomaly which arises in the fourth week of the embryogenesis, at a stadium in which the trachea and esophagus should separate from each other. In case of failure of complete separation esopaghus atresia can occur. Clinically the neonate cannot swallow saliva, may blow bubbles and will aspirate on feeding. When a feeding tube is inserted it cannot be passed distally. A radiograph with a curled up feeding tube will confirm the diagnosis. Contrast swallow studies should not be performed as they can cause severe aspiration. Often the proximal pharyngeal pouch is dilated. In 80% of cases a distal tracheo-esophageal fistula is present. Less common is: First look at the image and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are: Cases without a distal fistula can be suspected antenatally when there is a polyhydramnion and an empty stomach. Always screen the radiograph for other anomalies as esophagus atresia can be part of the VACTERL association (vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiovascular malformations, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, renal and limb anomalies).
Duodenal atresia:
In duodenal atresia the duodenum fails to canalize properly late in the first trimester and a web or several webs occur. In cases of atresia the web is complete. Most often the atresia occurs distal to Vater's ampulla. The obstruction causes the duodenum to expand and this creates the double bubble sign (dilated stomach and duodenum). When a polyhydramnion and a double bubble are present antenatally, the diagnosis can be suspected before birth. First look at the image and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are: This confirms the diagnosis of duodenal atresia and no further imaging is needed. In extreme prematures the diagnosis can be more challenging when the duodenum has not had enough time to dilate. Here another case of duodenal atresia with the typical double bubble sign. Note that the nasogastral tube may decompress the stomach and duodenum limiting the interpretation of the film. One may inject some air through the tube prior to the film. About 30% of the patients with duodenal atresia have Down syndrome and there is an association with VACTERL malformations, malrotation and biliary tree abnormalities.
Duodenal web:
First look at the image and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are: This radiograph was taken only a few hours after birth and air has not reached the distal small bowel and colon yet. Duodenal web has the same etiology as duodenal atresia, but the web is fenestrated and the obstruction is incomplete. Depending on the severity of the stenosis, patients may present in the neonatal period or at a later age. Radiographs may show a double bubble, but with distal bowel gas being present. Here another case of a duodenal web. Both radiographs and upper GI series cannot differentiate between duodenal web and annular pancreas. Annular pancreas however, is less common. It is often discovered incidentally or in adults when the associated abnormal biliary drainage causes pancreatitis. Another rare diagnosis with similar radiological findings is the preduodenal portal vein - often associated with other abnormalities in the abdomen (like situs ambiguus). p= pylorus. First look at the images of the upper GI-study and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are:
Malrotation:
In the developing embryo growth of the bowel requires herniation into the omphalomesenteric sac. In the tenth week of gestation the bowel returns to the abdominal cavity. This return is accompanied by a counterclockwise rotation of the midgut to achieve its final position with the ligament of Treitz in the left upper quadrant and the caecum in the right lower quadrant, suspended from a long mesentery. Malrotation arises when the rotation is arrested or even reversed. As a result the bowel has an abnormal position, the mesentery is short and peritoneal bands, called Ladd's bands, may cross from the caecum to the liver or to the anterior abdominal wall. Treitz ligament is on the left side of the spine. The small intestine is predominantly on the left. The cecum is in the right lower quadrant There is a long mesentery. Displacement of Treitz inferiorly and rightward. The small intestine is found predominantly on the right. Fibrous bands course over the vertical portion of the duodenum causing obstruction.
* Right Volvulus due to short mesentery. Ischemic bowel. Here a neonate with a malrotation. The abdominal radiograph is non-specific (image on the left) The upper GI study clearly demonstrates that the small bowel projects to the right of the spine. The malrotation will become symptomatic only when a volvulus occurs due to the short mesentery or when the Ladd's band obstruct the duodenum Both presentations are most common in the neonatal period. However sometimes it can also present later in life, for example when the volvulus is intermittent or when the Ladd's bands create relatively little obstruction. Acute volvolus is a life-threatening presentation and requires prompt surgical intervention. The upper GI-study shows a malrotation complicated by a volvulus. This results in the typical corkscrew or reversed 3 sign. An overfilled stomach could hide the corkscrew on the AP projection so the stomach should first be aspirated by use of a nasogastric tube and the volume of injected contrast should be small. Sometimes a malrotation can be suspected when on ultrasound the superior mesenteric artery is seen to lie to the right of the superior mesenteric vein. This sign however is neither specific nor sensitive and should not be used when asked to investigate for suspected malrotation without a volvulus. An abnormal location of ligament of Treitz on an upper GI series is the gold standard for malrotation. In case of a volvolus the child is acutely sick and ultrasound is often the modality of choice. This will show a whirlpool sign of the vessels which confirms the presence of a volvolus. The corkscrew sign of the bowel on the upper GI is equivalent. Once a volvolus is diagnosed on ultrasound, the child should go straight to the operating room and no more time should be lost on further imaging.
Jejunal atresia:
Jejunal atresia is the most frequent cause of upper intestinal obstruction. It is caused by an ischemic event in utero. Antenatally a polyhydramnion will be present. More atretic foci can be present simultaneously. A typical case will show a triple bubble sign on a radiograph, with the third bubble being the dilated jejunum (figure). The radiographs however are not always straightforward. When in doubt, an upper GI-study is indicated which will confirm the occlusion. Here another case of jejunal atresia.
Congenital Low Obstruction:
A low obstruction is an obstruction in the ileum or in the colon. Passage of meconium should normally occur within 48 hours from birth. In a low obstruction the neonate will have difficulty passing meconium or will not pass any meconium at all. Because of the constipation the child will start to vomit. The presence of a microcolon on the colon enema indicates that the meconium has not reached the colon and the obstruction is situated proximal to the colon.
Ileal atresia:
As with jejunal atresia, ileal atresia results from an in utero ischemic event. More atretic foci can be present simultaneously, but the distal ileum is the most common site to be involved. Radiographs will show multiple dilated bowel loops and absence of air in the colon as seen on the image on the left. A colon enema will show a microcolon with contrast filling ending blind in the ileum (arrow on image on the right).
Meconium ileus:
Meconium ileus occurs nearly exclusively in patients with cystic fibrosis. In 10% of patients it is the first presentation of the disease. Due to the exocrine dysfunction of the pancreas and abnormal intestinal secretions, the meconium is abnormally thick and becomes impacted in the ileum. It is the neonatal equivalent of DIOS (distal intestinal obstruction syndrome). Sometimes radiographs demonstrate typical 'soap bubbles', which represent captured air between meconium pellets. The tenacious meconium prevents the occurence of air fluid levels on the decubitus image. Bowel loops are usually of different caliber and not all loops are dilated. Colon enema shows a microcolon with stacked meconium pellets in the ileum. Once you have made the diagnosis of a meconium ileus, you can opt to set in moderately hyperosmolar contrast for therapeutic purposes as this can help to dissolve the meconium and act as an effective enema. Since the hyperosmolar contrast will create a fluid shift and thereby may cause dehydration, it is of importance to clearly communicate with the clinician to administer extra fluids and secure continuous careful surveillance. Here two cases of meconium ileus. There is a microcolon and there are multiple meconium pellets in the distal small bowel (arrows). Meconiumplugsyndrome: normal rectum and a small diameter to the left colon. Because the child has a functionally normal rectum he continued to evacuate the contrast and a balloon catheter had to be used.
Meconium plug syndrome:
Meconium plug syndrome is also known as small left colon syndrome. Meconium plugging in the left colon occurs when the colon is functionally immature with little motility. There is an association with maternal diabetes and drug use in pregnancy. The condition is temporarily and when the meconium plugs resolve, the colon distends normally and functions normally. The neonate is otherwise healthy and there is no association with cystic fibrosis. There is no air in the rectum on the radiograph. Colon enema shows a normal rectal diameter which excludes Hirschsprung disease. A microcolon is absent. Meconium is found throughout the colon, but most typically found in the left colon, which may also have a smaller diameter. Just as with a meconium ileus, you may now opt to give a hyperosmolar contrast enema to help resolve the meconium (see above).
Hirschsprung disease:
In Hirschsprung disease ganglion cells are absent in the distal part of the colon. Because the intestinal ganglion cells migrate in a craniocaudal direction, the area of aganglionosis always involves the rectum. More extensive disease extends orally in a contiguous fashion. The involved bowel has a small diameter and the bowel proximal to the affected segment is dilated. In Hirschsprung disease the ratio between the denervated and the non-affected bowel is <1. It is important to describe the length of the affected segment. Most cases are short-segment and total aganglionosis is rare. In case of total aganglionosis the diagnosis is difficult, because the entire colon has a small caliber and resembles a microcolon. Saw tooth contractions in Hirschsprung disease Start the enema in the lateral position to evaluate the rectum. Save cine images from the first contrast injection, as with progressive filling signs can become obscured by too much bowel distention. Normally the rectum should be wider than the sigmoid. The image shows an abnormal recto-sigmoid index <1. Here another case of Hirschsprung disease. The definitive diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease is confirmed with biopsy. About 90% of Hirschsprung disease is diagnosed in the neonatal age, but some cases are discovered later in life. Anal atresia: markers are placed on the external sphincter. The rectum ends blind (*)
Anal atresia:
The diagnosis of anal atresia is usually clinically straightforward by inspection and digital palpation. Anal atresia is part of the spectrum of anorectal and cloacal malformations and is a complex disorder. Imaging and treatment should be performed in specialized centers. Initially plain films and ultrasound can be used to show the position of the malformation and the need for a colostomy. At a later stage and prior to definitive surgery a combination of fluoroscopic studies and MRI will be used to show the complex anatomy of anorectal, genitourinary, pelvic and perineal structures and associated fistulas. Anal atresia is part of the VACTERL malformations and patients should be screened for concomittant anomalies.
Acquired causes of acute abdomen:

Necrotizing enterocolitis:
Necrotizing enterocolitis is a severe bowel inflammation. The etiology is not entirely clear and seems to be a combination of immature bowel mucosa, infection and ischemia. Initially radiographs are nonspecific and may only show bowel dilatation. Absence of a changing bowel pattern over time is worrisome. Pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous air (pneumoportogram) can both be seen on radiographs and with ultrasound. The most feared complication is perforation. Pneumatosis intestinalis in a child with NEC NEC occurs most often, but not exclusively, in prematures. Neonates with severe stress, for example with cardiac disease, are also at risk. Clinically, retentions and bloody stools can be a key to the diagnosis. The images show a typical case of NEC with pneumatosis intestinalis. On the horizontal beam image there is no sign of free air. Here images of a neonate who developed NEC. At this early stage the radiograph only shows non-specific bowel dilatation. At this stage you cannot make the diagnosis. Here another typical case of NEC. Notice the air in the portal vein (arrow) and peripheral portal branches. This is seen on the X-Ray and on ultrasound. In this patient with NEC notice all the airbubbles in the wall of the bowel and within the liver. Pneumoperitoneum in severe NEC. Air can be seen on both sides of the bowel wall. This is called the Rigler sign. In about 20% of patients with NEC strictures can occur in a later stage. Sometimes necrotizing enterocolitis can have a subclinical course and strictures are the only sign the newborn has endured the disease. The image on the left is taken 6 days after birth and shows distended bowel with pneumatosis intestinalis. A colon enema at 6 weeks of age shows a stricture in the colon descendens (arrow). Here a long stricture in the colon transversum in a child who had a NEC.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis:
Projectile vomiting is the key feature in patients with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The cause of the muscle hypertrophy which causes the gastric outlet obstruction is unknown. There is a familial predisposition and it is more common in boys. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents after the neonatal period, at the age of 4-8 weeks. However early presentation can also occur. Ultrasound in a fasting child will show retained fluid in the stomach. There is no passage along the hypertrophic pyloric muscle. For optimal viewing the child must be positioned right side down and if the stomach is empty it should be filled by drinking Pedialyte or glucose solution during the examination. If the stomach is too full, the child can be placed on the left side to help the pylorus to move anteriorly. The transversal diameter of the single muscle wall is the most reliable measurement to diagnose pyloric muscle hypertrophy. A measurement of more than 3 mm on a transverse image indicates hypertrophy. A transverse total diameter more than 14 mm and a total length of the pyloric canal more than 15 mm support the diagnosis.
Incarcerated hernia:
Neonates and especially prematures have a relatively weak abdominal wall and inguinal hernias are common, especially in boys. In case of multiple dilated bowel loops on the radiograph, always check the groins for the presence of a hernia containing a bowel loop (figure). Ultrasound is the modality of choice to evaluate hernias, and in girls it is important to look for herniation of the ovaries. Study the image. What are the findings and what is your diagnosis. The findings are: This was an incarcerated inguinal hernia.

Ovarian cystic lesions.:
Wouter Veldhuis, Robin Smithuis, Oguz Akin and Hedvig Hricak
Department of Radiology of the University Medical Center of Utrecht, of the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands and the Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA:
Publicationdate 2011-05-18 In this review the imaging features of normal ovaries and the most common ovarian cystic masses are presented. In Ovarian Cystic Masses Part I a roadmap for the diagnostic workup and management of ovarian cystic masses is presented based on the findings of ultrasound and MRI. Images can be enlarged by clicking on them. On the iPhone application this results in hi-res images at full retina resolution.
Normal ovaries:

premenopausal:
The normal ovary contains over two million primary oocytes at birth, about 10 of which mature each menstrual cycle. Of the 10 Graafian follicles that begin to mature, only one becomes the dominant follicle and grows to a size of 18-20 mm by mid-cycle, when it ruptures to release the oocyte. The other nine follicles become atretic and fibrous. After release of the oocyte, the dominant follicle collapses, and the granulosa cells in the inner lining proliferate and swell to form the corpus luteum of menstruation. Over the course of 14 days the corpus luteum degenerates, leaving the small scarred corpus albicans. Graafian follicles Graafian follicles The normal ovary in pre-menopausal women contains small cysts. The images show two normal ovaries with several anechoic, simple cysts consistent with Graafian follicles. On T2-weighted MR-images the Graafian follicles are seen as bright cysts surrounded by darker solid ovarian stroma. FDG-PET pitfall - normal premenopausal ovaries In some pre-menopausal women the normal ovaries may be avidly PET positive, depending on the date in the menstrual cycle. Because in pre-menopausal women a PET-positive ovary may be either an adnexal neoplasm or completely normal, it is important to be aware of the possibility of physiologic mid-cycle FDG uptake and to correlate this finding with the clinical history. FDG-PET in pre-menopausal women should therefore preferably be scheduled in the first week of the menstrual cycle. In post-menopausal women, the normal ovaries show only minimal uptake of FDG. Any increased ovarian FDG uptake in this age group is suspicious for a possible neoplasm. LEFT: Postmenopausal woman. The ovary is a T2 dark tissue clump near the proximal end of the round ligament.RIGHT: T2 dark left ovary devoid of follicles. It is a bit prominent, but is still likely to be normal
Post-menopausal:
Post-menopause is defined as 1 year or more of amenorrhea. In Western countries the average age of menopause is 51-53 years. In post-menopausal women the ovaries are generally smaller and gradually stop forming Graafian follicles. Note, however, that follicular cysts may persist several years after menopause. In the coronal T2-weighted image of a postmenopausal woman the ovary is no more than a dark tissue clump near the proximal end of the round ligament. The axial T2-weighted image also shows a dark left ovary, devoid of follicles. Although a bit prominent, this is likely to be completely normal. Only if, by chance, there happened to be prior imaging showing that the lesion was growing, your differential diagnosis would start with a benign solid lesion such as ovarian fibroma or fibrothecoma.
Functional cysts:
By far the most common cystic ovarian lesions are benign functional ovarian cysts. Functional cysts are Graafian follicles or corpora lutea that have grown too large or have bled, but are otherwise benign. In the early post-menopause phase, 1-5 years after the final menstrual period, sporadic ovulatory cycles still may occur and ovarian cysts may be seen. Even in late menopause, which is defined as more than 5 years since the final menstrual period, when ovulation is unlikely to occur, small simple cysts may be seen in up to 20% of women.
Follicular cyst:
A dominant Graafian follicle sometimes fails to ovulate and does not involute. When it becomes larger than 3 cm, it is called a follicular cyst. Follicular cysts are usually 3-8 cm, but may become much larger. On ultrasound follicular cysts present as simple unilocular, anechoic cysts with a thin, smooth wall. There should be no enhancing nodules or other solid components, no enhancing septations, and no more than physiologic ascites. Follicular cysts will usually resolve spontaneously on follow-up.
Corpus luteum cyst:
A corpus luteum may seal and fill with fluid or blood, forming a corpus luteum cyst. The transvaginal ultrasound images show a small complex ovarian cyst with wall vascularity on power Doppler analysis. The characteristic circular Doppler appearance is called the 'ring of fire'. Note, there is good through-transmission and no internal vascularity, consistent with a, partially involuted, corpus luteum cyst. Remember that women who are on birth control pills usually won't form a corpus luteum, as birth control pills prevent ovulation. On the other hand, use of fertility drugs that induce ovulation, increases the chance of developing corpus luteum cysts. Corpus luteum cyst Another case with the typical the 'ring of fire' on ultrasound. At pathologic examination the collapsed bloody cyst can be clearly seen. Corpus luteum cyst Corpus luteum cyst at MRI: an axial T2-weighted image demonstrating an involuting corpus luteum cyst (arrow). This is a normal finding. The right ovary is also normal. Hemorrhagic cyst with a clot mimicking a neoplasm. Notice absence of flow and good through-transmission
Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst:
When a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. On ultrasound hemorrhagic ovarian cyst presents as an unilocular thin-walled cyst with fibrin-strands or low-level echoes and good through transmission. On MRI hemorrhagic cysts are bright on pre-contrast T1-FatSat, and dark on T2. There should be no internal vascularity on Doppler ultrasound or internal enhancement on CT or MRI. Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts have variable wall thickness, and often some circumferential vascularity can be seen. Clinically the classic presentation is with acute pain. However HOC can also be an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst The ultrasound images show multiple simple and one complex right ovarian lesion (red arrow). The latter demonstrates diffuse low-level echos and no flow on Doppler. Note that there is a good through transmission (blue arrow). These findings indicate the presence of a hemorrhagic cyst. Continue with the MR-images. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst Axial and sagittal T2W images from the same patient. The right ovary contains multiple simple T2 bright cysts with thin borders and no solid components. On the axial image there is one lesion, that is dark on T2, i.e. a complex cyst (arrow). There is a small amount of ascites around the right ovary, but not enough to raise concern of a possible neoplasm. On the T1-weighted image without fatsat the complex cyst is bright, indicating either fat or blood content. On the T1-weighted image with fatsat the lesion remains bright, ruling out a fatty lesion. After the administration of Gd there is no enhancement, confirming that this is a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. An endometrioma would be in your differential. Note that subtraction images are best to demonstrate the lack of enhancement in a lesion, that is bright on the pre-contrast T1-weighted image. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in both right and left ovary The ultrasound images show the right and left ovary: on both sides there is what appears to be a solid lesion. There is however good through transmission, which indicates that we are probably dealing with hemorrhagic cysts. On Doppler US (not shown) there was no vascularity. Continue with the MR examination. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst On an axial T1-weighted image both lesions are bright indicating fat, blood or high protein fluid. Fat saturation does not suppress the signal in these lesions. In an image with overall reasonably good fat suppression this rules out a fat-containing teratoma and confirms the suggestion of hemorrhagic fluid. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. Left:image without subtraction. Right: image with subtraction. On the axial T2-weighted image both lesions show typical 'shading'. The gradual drop in T2 is thought to be caused by a combination of increasing viscosity and increasing concentration of protein and iron towards the dependent portion of the lesion. There is no enhancement on the subtraction image (Post-Gd minus Pre-Gd). Again, subtraction is useful in cases like this: Gd-induced signal increase over the already very bright pre-contrast image would be very hard to appreciate otherwise.
Other benign cystic and cyst-like lesions:
Vaginal ultrasound showing a large hypoechoic cystic lesion with diffuse low-level echo's
Endometrioma:
Cystic endometriosis or endometrioma is a type of cyst formed when endometrial tissue grows in the ovaries. It affects women during the reproductive years and may cause chronic pelvic pain associated with menstruation. The ovaries are involved in approximately 75% of patients with endometriosis. On ultrasound endometrioma can be variable but the great majority (about 95%) of patients present with a classic homogeneous, hypoechoic cyst with diffuse low level echoes. Rarely it is anechoic, mimicking a functional ovarian cyst. Endometriomas can be multilocular and have thin or even thick septations. Transvaginal ultrasound: endometrioma with two hyperechoic wall foci, consistent with cholesterol deposits (arrows) In about one third of patients, on careful examination, small echogenic foci can be seen adhering to the wall. These have been postulated to be cholesterol deposits, but may also constitute small blood clots or debris. It is important to differentiate these foci from true wall nodules. In the presence of these foci, the diagnosis of an endometrioma is very likely. The transvaginal ultrasound shows a typical endometrioma, with hyperechoic wall foci. At Doppler US no vascularity was seen in these foci (not shown). The next case is a transvaginal US-image that shows a cystic lesion with a hyperechoic structure. There is a wide differential diagnosis including ovarian cystic neoplasm with solid component, mature cystic teratoma with hyperechoic Rokitansky nodule, hemorrhagic cyst with clot and endometrioma with clot or debris. Continue with the CT and MR. Endometrioma A CT was requested that turned out to show the same, predominantly cystic lesion. If additional imaging is needed for cysts that are indeterminate at ultrasound, it is better to perform MRI. The T2-weighted image on the right correlates nicely with the ultrasound image. On T2-weighted images endometriomas typically show 'shading'. LEFT: Gd-enhanced T1-weighted image with fatsat. RIGHT: Subtraction image. MRI confirms the absence of any enhancement, confirming that it is most likely debris within the cyst. On MRI the hemorrhagic content will make endometrioma appear bright on T1-weighted images. On T1-fatsat images an endometrioma will remain bright. This in contrast to teratomas, that are also bright on T1 but dark on T1-fatsat images. Always include a T1 fat suppressed sequence, because this makes small T1 bright lesions more conspicuous. Endometrioma The next case is a unilocular, mildly hypoechoic ovarian lesion with through transmission. There is no internal or wall vascularity on Doppler. On ultrasound this can again either be a hemorrhagic cyst or an endometrioma. Continue with the MR images Endometrioma 6 months later a follow-up MRI was performed. The lesions are bright on T1-weighted images. The bright signal persists on fat saturation indicating the presence of blood. There is T2 shading consistent with a hemorrhagic lesion. There is no enhancement. The fluid-fluid level in the right ovarian lesion also confirms its cystic nature. The fact that the lesions persist after 6 months makes bilateral endometrioma much more likely than hemorrhagic cysts. Axial MR demonstrating characteristic 'string-of-pearls' appearance
Polycystic ovary syndrome:
The Poly-Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Imaging can confirm or suggest the diagnosis. Imaging criteria: These patients usually have menstrual cycle irregularities and either typical clinical signs of hirsutism, obesity, infertility, acne, male balding pattern or biochemically show increased androgen levels. Sagittal MR-image in a patient with polycystic ovary syndrome On the left a sagittal T2-weighted image in a patient with increased serum androgen levels. The ovary is enlarged and shows multiple small peripherally located simple cysts
The obesity associated with this syndrome is evident from the abundance of fat, showing bright on these FSE T2-weighted images. In this patient, MRI confirmed the diagnosis of PCOS. Theca lutein cysts. The septations do not show enhancement on Doppler evaluation.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome - Theca lutein cysts:
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a relatively rare condition. It is caused by hormonal overstimulation by hCG, and is therefore usually bilateral. Hormonal overstimulation can occur in gestational throphoblastic disease, PCOS or in patients receiving hormonal therapy. It can also be seen in pregnancy, but seldom in a normal single pregnancy. If it does occur in normal pregnancies, the reported natural course is spontaneous resolution after birth. In normal pregnancies the reported natural course is spontaneous resolution after birth. Hormonal overstimulation more often occurs in molar pregnancy, erythroblastosis fetalis or in plural pregnancies. On imaging there is - usually bilateral - ovarian enlargement with multiloculated cyst that can totally replace the ovary. The clinical history is the distinguishing feature to make the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Theca lutein cysts: US images of a young pregnant woman. In both ovaries there are multiple cysts. Right image shows an invasive uterine mass, consistent with invasive molar pregnancy. The US images are of a young pregnant woman, who had multiple ovarian cysts. The other ovary is not shown but showed a similar appearance. The features needed to make the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome are in the clinical history - a young pregnant woman - and in the last image of the uterus, which shows an invasive uterine mass, consistent with invasive molar pregnancy.
PID with tubo-ovarian abscess:
Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) usually arises as a complication of Chlamydia or Gonorrhoeae infection that rises from the vagina or cervix to the fallopian tubes. On imaging a thick-walled complex cystic ovarian lesion is seen with abundant flow. The presence of a thickened endometrium or hydrosalphinx makes the diagnosis of a PID more likely. The axial CECT image shows a left complex cystic lesion with thick enhancing walls and internal gas. It looks like an abscess. Note the relatively unremarkable aspect of the overlying mesentery: this is unlikely to be a peri-diverticular abscess. Continue with the reconstructed images. On the sagittal image notice, that the lesion is connected to the ovarian vein confirming that this is an ovarian lesion (arrow). The coronal image shows the anatomic connection to the uterus. There is a gasbubble in the uterine cavity, which confirms the suggestion of an infection rising from the uterine cavity via the salphinx to involve the ovary (click or tap the image to enlarge).
Benign cystic ovarian neoplasms:
Mature cystic teratoma with a Rokitansky nodule or dermoid plug
Mature cystic teratoma:
A very common benign ovarian lesion that may appear cystic is a mature cystic teratoma, also called dermoid cyst. Mature in this context means benign, as opposed to the immature, malignant teratoma. Benign cystic teratomas typically occur in young women of child-bearing age. At imaging they are usually unilocular (up to 90%) but can be multilocular, and are bilateral in ~15%. Up to 60% may contain calcifications. The cystic component is fluid fat, produced by sebaceous glands in cyst lining. The presence of fat is diagnostic. The characteristic ultrasound appearance is that of a cystic mass, with a hyperechoic solid mural nodule, which is called a Rokitansky nodule or dermoid plug (figure). Tip-of-the-iceberg sign In another case the transvaginal ultrasound shows the 'tip-of-the-iceberg' sign: acoustic shadowing from the hyperechoic part of the dermoid cyst. This may be misinterpreted as bowel gas and the lesion may be overlooked. A fat-fluid level may be present, caused by fat floating on more aqueous fluid. Multiple thin, echogenic lines or stripes may be seen, caused by hair floating in the cyst cavity. Mature cystic teratomas, even though benign, are often resected because of increased risk of ovarian torsion, the most commonly associated complication. Other complications associated with teratoma are infection, rupture (spontaneous or trauma) and, rarely, hemolytic anemia (resolves with resection). Malignant transformation can occur but is also rare ( Axial T1-weighted image in the same patient shows a bright lesion with an internal septation. A septation is seen in about 10% of thse lesions. On the T1-weighted image with fat suppression there is suppression of the signal. This confirms the fatty content and is diagnostic of a teratoma. Classic low attenuation consistent with fat in a right sided cystic teratoma at CT.
Cystadenoma and cystadenofibroma:
Cystadenoma and cystadenofibroma are also common benign ovarian tumors. They can be either serous or mucinous. At imaging a serous cystadenoma is most often unilocular and anechoic, and may look like a simple cyst. Mucinous cystadenomas are most often multilocular with thin (
The locules may contain complex fluid, due to proteinaceous debris or hemorrhage, or both. The finding of papillary projections should raise the suspicion of a possible borderline malignancy or a cystadenocarcinoma. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a 5.1x5.2-cm dominant left ovarian cyst. The cyst is anechoic and no septations are seen. Also there is no ascites. There is, however, a nodule on the posterior wall that shows no flow on Doppler. This may be a follicular cyst with some debris, but a cystic neoplasm cannot be excluded. Work-up with MRI is recommended. T2-weighted image of the same patient shows thin enhancing septations (as well as motion artifacts that should not be mistaken for septations). There are no tumor nodules and no adenopathy or peritoneal deposits. There is only a small amount of ascites. This proved to be a cystadenoma. The next case is another cystic lesion On the posterior wall a solid mural nodule is found, which is avascular. No secondary signs of malignancy. Continue with the MRI. Five years later the lesion has grown. Axial T2 shows a complex cystic left ovarian lesion, with a solid nodule on the posterior wall. At post-contrast axial T1W-FatSat the thin septa and the mural nodule show slight enhancement. On the basis of these findings the distinction between a benign ovarian lesion such as a cystadenofibroma and a malignant lesion cannot be made. The lesion was resected and was found to be a cystadenofibroma. The next case is a transabdominal ultrasound that shows a left-sided multiloculated cystic mass. This looks like a cystic ovarian neoplasm but no ovary could be identified. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images CT of the same patient shows a multi-loculated cystic mass adjacent to the bladder, connected to the left ovarian vein (arrow). There are thick septations and irregular wall thickening. On the basis of this CT the distinction between a benign ovarian lesion such as as cystadenofibroma and a malignant ovarian lesion cannot be made. The lesion was resected and found to be a cystadenofibroma.
Malignant cystic ovarian neoplasms:
Remember, the role of imaging is not to determine the histological nature of a lesion, but to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and guide decisions on further management. The examples given here serve as a demonstration of suspicious imaging features, not as a guide for determination of histologic lesion type.
Serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma:
Ultrasound shows a complex solid-cystic mass in the left ovary, and another, very large complex solid-cystic mass in the right hemi-pelvis. CT of the same patient shows a complex solid-cystic mass with thick, enhancing septations in the right ovary. These findings are very suspicious for a malignant cystic neoplams. There is also bilateral lymphadenopathy (arrows). Pathology showed a serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma. This is the most common type of ovarian cancer.
Mucinous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma:
Ultrasound shows a very large multi-loculated cystic lesion in the region of the right adnex. Some locules are anechoic. Others contain uniform low-level echoes, consistent with proteineous content, such as hemorrhage or, in this case, mucin. The septations are thin, except for the dorsal septations that appear somewhat thicker, partially caused by the lower scanresolution at great depth.
The septations are avascular.
There are no solid components.
There was no ascites. Despite the absence of solid components and despite the absence of vascularity on color Doppler, the size and the multi-loculated aspect of this lesion are suspicious for a cystic neoplasm and warant further evaluation. The CECT shows similar findings.
The locules are of different attenuation, consistent with varying protein content. There is no ascites orperitoneal deposits and no lymphadenopathy. At pathology this was a mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of low malignant potential. Specimen of the mucinous cystadenocarcinoma The thin, relatively avascular septae, the absence of frank solid components, the absence of ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis and the absence of invasion, suggest a lesion of low malignant potential (LMP). Note however, that this diagnosis can not be made on imaging findings alone. Especially the absence of invasion in ovarian stroma cannot be judged reliably on imaging.
Endometrioid ovarian carcinoma:
On ultrasound both ovaries are markedly enlarged and contain cystic components with intracystic solid components (arrows). The complex solid-cystic lesions, in addition to being bilateral, are suspicious for a cystic ovarian neoplasm and warrant further evaluation. Again, the role of imaging is to confirm a lesion is present and to decide that this is not a lesion that can be classified as definitely benign nor a lesion that can be safely followed-up: action is required. CT of the same patient confirms large bilateral complex solid-cystic lesions, bulging into the abdomen. The purpose of the CT is not to confirm what was already known from the ultrasound, but to stage disease. On the basis of CT (or of MRI) it is not possible to determine the histologic type of the tumor. This is not relevant. This patient will undergo surgery. For epithelial tumors - by far the most common group of malignant ovarian tumors - even after surgery, the exact tumor subtype is much less important for the prognosis than factors such as FIGO-stage, tumor differentation grade, and how succesful surgery was in removing all of the disease. For this patient the relevant findings are on the image on the left. There is a peritoneal implant. The tumor was resected and pathology showed this was an endometrioid ovarian carcinoma.
Cystic metastases to the ovaries:
While metastases to the ovary are most commonly solid - such as for example Krukenbergs metastases - cystic ovarian metastases do occur. The CT image shows complex cystic masses in both ovaries. While a serous cystadenocarcinoma may very well be bilateral, they are more often unilocular than multilocular. Barely visible is part of a circumferential colorectal cancer (blue arrow). Clearly visible are cystic implants on the peritoneal reflection (red arrow).
These were cystic ovarian metastases of a colorectal cancer.

Algoritm for Ankle Fractures 2.0:
Frank Smithuis and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre in Amsterdam and Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp in the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 01-08-2021 In this lecture we present a simple algoritm that helps you to find: The algoritm is based on the Weber-classification, because it is simple and everybody knows it. Since the Weber-classification is a simplification of the Lauge-Hansen classification, it will help you to understand the different stages of Lauge-Hansen.
Introduction:

Algoritm for ankle fractures:
Step 1
The first question you should ask yourself is:
Is it a Weber type A fracture?Is there an avulsion of the lateral malleolus. That’s easy. Step 2
If it is not a type A. Then the next question is:
Is it a Weber type B fracture?This oblique fracture at the level of the syndesmosis is always easy to find on the x-rays. Step 3
If it is not type A or type B, then the last question is:
Can this be a Weber type C fracture?These fractures are usually not visible on x-rays of the ankle, because the fibula fracture is too high, but the algoritm provides clues for the detection of these fractures. When we've answered the above questions, then we end up in one of these three categories.
In each of these categories we need to determine the stage of the fracture, which tells us if the ankle is stable or unstable. In Weber A stage 1 is stable. 
However when there is also a vertical or push-off fracture of the medial malleolus, then it is stage 2 and the ankle is unstable, as the ring of stability is broken in two places. In Weber B stage 2 is stable, but stage 3 and 4 are unstable. In Weber C finding a high fibula fracture means unstable stage 3. Since this fracture is usually not visible on x-rays of the ankle, you wanna study the ankle x-rays to look for stage 1 and 4, which can be a clue to image the whole lower leg to look for a high fibula fracture. These stages in Weber B and C always follow a strict order.
This means that when you find a stage 3 fracture, there already must be a stage 1 and 2 even if you can't see them.
We will discuss these stages in the next chapter.
Fracture stages:
This is an overview of the stages of ankle fractures. It was originally described by Christian Lauge-Hansen, a Danish pathologist in 1950 and later copied by Bernhard Georg Weber in 1972, a member of the AO-group. Stages of Weber A Stages of Weber B Stages of Weber C Weber B and Weber C fractures are very different in the type of fibula fracture. 
In Weber B there is a oblique oriented push-off fracture at the level of the syndesmosis, while in Weber C there is a twist-like fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. Notice however, that there are many similarities between Weber B and C with only differences in the order of events. For instance a tertius fracture is either stage 3 in a Weber B or a stage 4 in Weber C fracture. Another important thing to realize is that traction on a ligament results in either a rupture of that ligament or an avulsion fracture at the insertion of that ligament.
Step 1 - is it a Weber A / SA:
Weber A is the result of a pull-off or avulsion on the lateral side due to extreme supination of the foot with adduction. This is stage 1 and is stable.
Lauge-Hansen calls this supination-adduction (SA). Although not that common, the injury may proceed and cause a push off fracture on the medial side resulting in a vertical fracture of the medial malleolus . This is always stage 2 and is unstable, whether you see a fracture of the lateral malleolus or not. In rare case you may find a vertical fracture of the medial malleolus in combination with a collateral band rupture on the lateral side. Stage 1: stable ankle fracture
Stage 1:
Here a typical avulsion or pull-off fracture of the lateral malleolus.
The avulsion fragment is quite large. More commonly there is a small avulsion fragment. This is a stage 1 stable Weber A fracture. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Stage 2: unstable ankle fracture Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Stage 2: unstable ankle fracture
Stage 2:
This case is more challenging.
This fibula fracture is at the level of the syndesmosis and maybe some people would call this a Weber B fracture, but it doesn't look like a Weber B. A weber B fracture is oblique and more vertical because it is a push-off fracture, which we will discuss later. Just by looking at the images, you can understand the trauma mechanism (scroll). This is a stage 2 - unstable bimalleolar Weber A fracture. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll stage 2: unstable ankle fractures. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll stage 2: unstable ankle fractures. The left image is another example of an unstable bimalleolar fracture stage 2 Weber A. The right image shows a vertical fracture of the medial malleolus (arrow). This is always stage 2 and unstable. It means that there already is stage 1, because the trauma mechanism always follows this strict order, first stage 1 and then stage 2. The ring of stability is broken in two places (scroll).
Step 2 - is it a Weber B / SER:
If it is not a Weber A fracture, then the next question is: is it a Weber B? When you see a Weber B fracture, which is always good visible on either the AP- or the lateral view, the only thing you need to check is whether there is an unstable stage 3 with posterior injury or even stage 4 with medial injury. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Weber B is the most common ankle fracture accounting for 60-70% of all ankle fractures. Just like a Weber C fracture it is the result of an exorotation force applied by the foot.
The only difference is that in Weber B the foot is in supination and the injury starts on the lateral side where the tension is, while in Weber C the injury starts on the medial side due to the position of the foot in pronation. Lauge-Hansen called this fracture mechanism supination exorotation or SER. 
The fracture mechanism that leads to a Weber C fracture is called pronation exorotation or PER and we will discuss it in the next section. Scroll through the images to see how the injury follows a clockwise fixed order. Things become very easy once you remember the fixed order of the injuries:
Tillaux fracture:
The injury mechanism that causes a Weber B fracture can stop at any stage. Most commonly we see stage 2 which is the oblique fibula fracture, but sometimes the injury stops at stage 1. Usually this is a rupture of the anterior syndesmosis and we don't see anything on the x-rays, but the patient will have a lot of pain on this specific anterolateral spot. The tension in the anterior syndesmosis can sometimes lead to an avulsion of the tibial attachment of the anterior syndesmosis, which is called a Tillaux fracture. An avulsion of the fibular attachment is even more rare. Images
On the AP-view and the coronal CT-reconstruction we see a Tillaux fracture as stage 1. No other fracture was seen. Study these images. You may have to click on them to get a larger view. First Question: Is it a Weber A, B or could it be a Weber C? Then try to figure out the stage and determine whether the ankle is stable or unstable. You can look at the next images for a discussion of the images. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images. It is a stage 4 Weber B fracture, which is unstable.
Step 3 - Could it be a Weber C / PER:
When the x-rays of the ankle show no obvious fracture like a Weber A or B, then the question is: could this be a Weber C fracture? 
Since the fibula fracture in a Weber C is most commonly not visible on the x-rays of the ankle, this can be a tough question to answer.
We will have to look for additional findings that lead us to the right answer and that will help us to make the decision to do additional images Since the fibula fracture is already stage 3, we wanna look for: Enable Scroll

Closed Loop in Small bowel obstruction:
by Jay P. Heiken and Robin Smithuis
Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology of the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri and the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2012-11-01 This article is based on a presentation given by Jay Heiken in 2006 and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. In 2012 an updated version was presented. Jay Heiken is professor of radiology at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. He has a special interest in abdominal imaging and is co-author of the well known book 'Computed Body Tomography With MRI Correlation'.
Small Bowel Closed Loop Obstruction:
Closed Loop Obstruction Closed loop obstruction is a specific type of obstruction in which two points along the course of a bowel are obstructed at a single location thus forming a closed loop. Usually this is due to adhesions, a twist of the mesentery or internal herniation. In the large bowel it is known as a volvulus. In the small bowel it is simply known as small bowel closed loop obstruction. Especially in the small bowel the risk of strangulation and bowel infarction is high with a mortality rate of 10-35%. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images Case of small bowel obstruction Let first start with a rather difficult case and then continue with some basic knowledge about closed loop obstruction. Here we have a patient with a small bowel obstruction. So the most important question for you to answer is:
Is there a closed loop obstruction?Because if there is, this patient is at risk for bowel infarction and surgery is the best option. Scroll through the images. Can you find the closed loop and what is the cause? When we have a patient in the ER with what appears to be a small bowel obstruction (SBO), the most important thing we can do, besides making the diagnosis, is to identify the presence or absence of strangulation. Strangulation is defined as obstruction associated with vascular compromise. The morbidity and mortality rate in the SBO-group is mainly due to bowel infarction and subsequent necrosis. This is most commonly caused by a closed loop obstruction. CT is the imaging procedure of choice in the evaluation of patients suspected of SBO. 'U' or 'C' shaped loops of bowel. Point of obstruction has a beak-like appearance The CT-presentation of a closed loop obstruction in the small bowel depends on two things: If we have a short closed loop oriented within the plane of imaging, we will see a U- or C-shaped loop of bowel. Closed loop obstruction with radial array of dilated loops. There is bowel wall thickening and mesenteric edema indicating ischemia Another important appearance of a closed loop obstruction is that of a radial array of dilated small bowel loops with the mesenteric vessels converging to a central point. This is almost always due to a small bowel volvulus. The findings of ischemia in closed loop obstruction are the same as in patients with other causes of mesenteric ischemia: Closed loop obstruction with bowel ischemia The case on the left shows another patient with closed loop obstruction. Although there is good enhancement of the vessels there seems to be a lack of enhancement of the bowel wall. Other signs of ischemia in this case are mesenteric edema and bowel wall thickening. Infarcted bowel was found at operation. Closed loop obstruction presenting as a clump of bowel loops If the closed loop is longer and is oriented perpendicular to the plane of section, we will see a clump of bowel loops as shown in the case on the left. Sometimes this is difficult to appreciate on just the axial images and coronal or sagittal reconstructions can be helpful. In this case there is also mesenteric edema and localised ascites in combination with dilated loops with wall thickening indicating strangulation and risk of infarction.
Imaging technique in SBO:
CT is the imaging procedure of choise in patients who are suspected for bowel obstruction. When we examine these patients, we should not give oral contrast for following reasons: In some of the patients with a closed loop obstruction a bowel obstruction is not suspected. In the case on the left positive oral contrast was given. Notice the constriction in the small bowel in figure B. Distal to the constriction in figure C we see a cluster of dilated small bowel loops not filled with oral contrast, indicating the closed loop. Only rarely contrast will pass the point of obstruction and enter the area of the closed loop. If we go back to figure B, you may already have noticed that there are two points of narrowing in the small bowel (arrows). Therefore we have two adjacent collapsed small bowel segments representing the point of the closed loop obstruction. The bowel wall thickening, ascites and mesenteric edema indicate the presence of bowel ischemia. Notice that you cannot appreciate the degree of bowel wall enhancement in the loops that are filled with oral contrast. Closed loop obstruction and small bowel feces sign in a patient with non-dilated proximal bowel
Small Bowel Feces Sign:
In some of these patients with SBO the proximal small bowel proximal to the point of obstruction may not be dilated. On the left we see images of a patient in whom obstruction was not suspected. This patient also received positive oral contrast. Look for the major findings and then continue. First you will notice that the small bowel is not dilated. When you go down to the pelvis you see a dilated loop of bowel with inhomogeneous content and finally deep down in the pelvis there is a C-shaped dilated bowel indicating a closed loop obstruction. The other important finding in this patient is the 'Small Bowel Feces Sign' (SBFS: arrow). The SBFS is a very useful sign as it is seen at the zone of transition from normal to obstructed bowel and thus facilitating identification of the point and the cause of the bowel obstruction. The SBFS has been defined as gas and solid material within a dilated small-bowel loop that simulates the appearance of feces. Enable Scroll

Case of small bowel strangulation:
The CT images are of a patient with mild left flank pain. At presentation the lab findings were normal. Based on this CT it was thought that this patient had a diverticulitis (red arrow). The mild dilatation of the small bowel adjacent to the descending colon was thought to be a reactive sentinel loop. Scroll through the axial images.

Volvulus of Large Bowel.:
On the left a plain abdominal film is shown of a 57 year old man with a two day history of increasing abdominal pain and distension. First look at the image and then continue. Besides diffuse dilatation of the bowel, the major finding on this film is a large air containing structure in the pelvis. An important diagnosis to consider would be a volvulus of the colon and many would diagnose this as a sigmoid volvulus because it is located in the pelvis. However this actually is a cecal volvulus as will be explained below. Cecal volvulus can go almost anywhere
Cecal Volvulus:
A volvulus always extends away from the area of bowel twist. So a sigmoid volvulus can only move upwards and usually goes to the right upper quadrant. Cecal volvulus however can go almost anywhere and can even be located in the pelvis (figure). On the left there are additional CT-images of the same patient as above. First look at these images and look for the major findings and then continue. First we see a collapsed descending colon and a non-dilated ascending colon, so this cannot be a sigmoid volvulus. Secondly, we see a beak-like structure in the right lower quadrant which is where the bowel is twisted.
In the left lower quadrant we see the dilated cecum. Coronal recontructions can be very helpfull in demonstrating what is going on. On the left we see the non-dilated ascending and descending colon (straight arrows) and the transition point of the volvulus (curved arrow). Cecal volvulus is due to the cecum twisting around the ascending colon thus leading to small bowel obstruction. A long narrow based mesentery predisposes to volvulus. An incomplete midgut rotation is a predisposing factor. Infarction is usually the result of venous congestion, while the arterial supply is rarely compromised. Cecal volvulus accounts for about 25% of cases of colonic volvulus. Dilated cecal volvulus (C) shifting away from the area of bowel twist (arrow) On the left a typical cecal volvulus is seen. We can see the beak-like transition zone located in the right lower quadrant indicating that this is a cecal volvulus. The dilated cecum is located in the left upper quadrant. Also notice the collapsed descending colon posterior to the dilated cecum (curved arrow). The x-rays show a typical cecal volvulus. Notice that the dilated bowel points toward the area of twist, which is the area where you expect the cecum to be located. Continue with the CT-images. Enable Scroll

Sigmoid Volvulus:
On the left a patient with a sigmoid volvulus. We can see the distended sigmoid extending from the pelvis way up into the right upper quadrant. Look at the image and decide for yourself why this cannot be a cecal volvulus. Then continue. The key finding is the dilatation of the proximal colon. The dilated loop seen on the left side is the dilated transverse colon. At CT we can nicely appreciate the area of the twist with the sigmoid extending up to the diafragm. The sigmoid is the commonest site of colonic volvulus. It accounts for 75% of large bowel obstruction. Sigmoid volvulus AP supine and erect radiograph of the abdomen demonstrates the characteristic coffee bean sign in sigmoid volvulus. Notice that the dilated loops point towards the sigmoid area.

Department of Radiology, Solid tumors and Nuclear Medicine of the University Medical Center Utrecht and Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology:
Publicationdate 15-11-2021 Malignant
abdominal tumors in children are rare and usually present as solid masses. Treatment is done in specialized
centers, but the initial diagnosis is usually made in the hospital where the
child first presents. In
this article we will provide tools to make the initial imaging diagnosis of the
most common malignant abdominal tumors as accurate as possible. This will guide the next imaging procedures Some benign tumors which can easily be mistaken for a malignancy are included. Cystic abdominal masses in children are discussed here.
Introduction:
The most common cancers overall in children are leukemia (28%), brain and spinal tumors (26%). 
They are followed by tumors that mainly present as an abdominal tumor: Neuroblastoma (8%), Nephroblastoma (5%) and Lymphoma (8%) (ref). Pediatric abdominal tumors are often very large at initial presentation, because most children come to attention because someone noted severe abdominal distention. It may seem a contradiction, but in very large tumors, it is usually more difficult to ascertain the organ of origin. The most common intra-abdominal tumors in children are: The key features of these abdominal tumors are presented in the table. Ultrasound is the first imaging modality to be used. 
It can easily confirm that there is a mass and can often define the site of origin. Search for synchronous movement with respiration of the tumor with its organ of origin. 
This can be seen in smaller hepatic and renal tumors. 
In large tumors the surrounding organs are compressed and will show no movement. Claw sign in renal tumor In renal tumors the “claw sign” is often present.
This is seen when a  part of the kidney is draped around the tumor like a claw (figure). Before we discuss the different abdominal tumors, it is good to realize that the definitive diagnosis is usually made by pathologic tissue examination. Most tumors are biopsied before treatment. 
However renal tumors in children between six months and nine years are not biopsied because the likelihood of it being a nephroblastoma is so high that the risk of a wrong diagnosis outweighs the risk of tumor spill during a biopsy, especially in diffuse anaplastic nephroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma:
Neuroblastomas are embryonic tumors originating from the sympatho-adrenal lineage of the neural crest. 
About half of the tumors arise from the adrenal glands. 
Other sites of origin are the thoracic and lumbal paravertebral sympathic chain. 
A minority develops in the neck. The clinical presentation is variable. Common complaints are pain and an abdominal mass. Neurologic signs due to intraspinal extension can occur. A typical manifestation is “raccoon eyes”, which is periorbital ecchymosis due to metastatic infiltration of the orbital area. A minority of the patients present with opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by rapid, multi-directional eye movements (opsoclonus), quick, involuntary muscle jerks (myoclonus), uncoordinated movement (ataxia), irritability, and sleep disturbance. The
prognosis depends on the stage of the tumor. 
For a low grade tumor the 5-year
survival is > 90%. 
For high risk tumors (stage 4 and tumors with MYCN
amplification) it is around 50%. The staging is rather complicated, see reference staging neuroblastoma.
Imaging findings:
The imaging findings are listed in the table. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Ultrasound:
On Ultrasound the tumor is generally echogenic and inhomogeneous with bright calcifications.
A feature of neuroblastoma is the tendency of vascular encasement and they have a tendency to grow between the vertebral column and the aorta which is lifted ventrally. 
Other tumors that show vascular encasement are lymphoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Intraspinal spread is common but difficult to assess with ultrasound. 
If lymphatic spread has occurred many round tumorous lymph nodes can be seen. The left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow’s node) is often involved in large left adrenal tumors. Video
The video shows a neuroblastoma in a one year old boy who presented with vomiting. The tumor encircles the aorta which is lifted from the vertebral column. Small calcifications are present. Continue with the MRI of this patient. Enable Scroll

MRI:
MRI is done for more detailed imaging of the tumor. MRI examination: Scroll through the coronal T2 weighted series. 
Study the images and then continue reading. The findings are: Same patient. This is an axial gadolinium enhanced T1W-image with fat suppression.
It shows the encasement of the vessels.
Notice the tumor extension posterior to the aorta, which is displaced away from the vertebral column (arrow). Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Ultrasound of a fifteen-month-old
boy, who was first suspected of having a tumor in the left
kidney. Ultrasound shows a mass adjacent to the medial
upper pole of the left kidney. It seems to be separate from the kidney. The mass is very inhomogeneous and has multiple calcifications. These findings are more compatible with a neuroblastoma than a nephroblastoma. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll The extent of the tumor is well appreciated on a 3D axial T2 weighted TSE series. The left kidney is compressed and displaced caudally. Para-aortal lymph node metastases are present (small yellow arrow). The origins of the celiac trunc and superior mesenteric artery are encased by tumor (arrowhead). 
The inferior caval vein is lifted anteriorly (green arrow). Bilateral dorsal atelectasis is often seen on the MRI, because the examination is done under anesthesia.
Biopsy:
Percutaneous biopsy can be difficult for two reasons: Images
The MRI is of a nine-months-old girl with a tumor in the left abdomen. The MRI shows a tumor of the left adrenal gland, partially solid, partially cystic. Multiple liver metastases are present. The tumor was biopsied. There was constant blood loss through the guiding needle. At the end of the procedure two gelatin foam plugs were placed (echogenic stripes (arrows).
MIBG:
All the activity indicates bone metastases. In metastasized neuroblastoma follow-up imaging can be quite confusing, as bone metastases may become more apparent when they are successfully treated.
Renal tumors:
Renal tumors in children will be discussed in more detail in a separate article.
Here we only show some common findings.
Nephroblastomas:
More than 90% of renal tumors in children are nephroblastomas - also called Wilms tumor. The peak age is 2 - 3 years. Frequently these tumors present with a distended painless abdomen and they are often very large at presentation. Sometimes they present with hematuria, abdominal pain or hypertension. Smaller
tumors are found during sonographic screening in children with syndromes which
predispose to nephroblastoma, like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Denys-Drash
syndrome (see the webpage on renal tumors in children). Bilateral nephroblastomas are often syndrome related. 
The lungs are the most frequent site of metastases. Liver and bone metastases are rare. ImageNephroblastoma of the left kidney in a three-year-old boy. The remnant of the kidney is draped over the tumor (“claw sign” arrow). The tumor is rather homogeneous with some cystic areas. Continue with the MRI. ImageNephroblastoma of the left kidney in a three-year-old boy. A bilobar tumor is present in the interpolar region. There is a dilated calyx in the upper pole (arrow). Treatment
In European countries the patient first receives chemotherapy, after which the kidney is resected, followed by post-operative chemotherapy (International Society of Pediatric Oncology, SIOP approach). 
In the US, the kidney is primarily resected, followed by chemotherapy (Children’s Oncology Group, COG approach). The results of both treatment regimens are about the same. 
The prognosis is excellent with a 5-year survival of more than 90%. 
Bilateral disease has a less favorable prognosis. A. The tumor enhances less than the peripheral remnant of normal renal tissue (blue arrow). The left renal vein is open (yellow arrow). Solid parts of the tumor show diffusion restriction (white arrow) UltrasoundThe initial imaging is usually done by ultrasound. Smaller tumors will be seen to move synchronous with the kidney. Large tumors will not move. As mentioned before, it is often possible to detect a remnant of the kidney draped around the tumor, the claw sign. The remnant can have a dilated calyx due to obstruction of the pelvis. Small tumors are usually homogenic and echogenic.
Larger tumors are more inhomogeneous with cystic or necrotic parts and hemorrhage. 
10% of the nephroblastomas have fine calcifications. Left sided nephroblastoma in a two-year-old girl. Note the para-aortal lymph node metastasis (arrow). Once you are sure of the renal origin of the tumor, study the other kidney for tumor or nephroblastomatosis (see below). 
Search for enlarged para-aortal lymph nodes. 
Search with color Doppler for patency of the renal vein and of the inferior caval vein, as a nephroblastoma tends to grow into the renal vein and inferior caval vein. Also image the liver for metastases, although these are rare in nephroblastoma. 
The finding of a liver metastasis should urge you to look for an alternative diagnosis like a rhabdoid tumor. A CT chest is performed for the assessment of pulmonary metastases. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll MRIThe next imaging step is a MRI of the abdomen. Nephroblastomas are mostly inhomogeneous, with decreased signal intensity on T1 and increased signal intensity on T2. Necrotic cystic parts are often present. 
Gadolinium enhancement is inhomogeneous and less than the enhancement of normal renal parenchyma. Solid parts of the tumor will show restricted diffusion. Hemorrhage is often present. Hemorrhagic areas will also show restricted diffusion, so look on the T1-images for signs of bleeding. 
Sometimes a disruption of the tumor capsule is seen. Intraperitoneal rupture is a more severe complication than retroperitoneal rupture. MRI can nicely demonstrate tumor thrombus in the renal vein and inferior caval vein, and lymph node enlargement. It allows accurate and repeatable measurements of the tumor on the initial and follow-up examinations. Example 1A three-year-old girl with a tumor of the left kidney and a large tumor thrombus in the renal vein and inferior caval vein.

Liver tumors:

Hemangioendothelioma:
Hemangioendothelioma of the liver is also known as infantile hemangioendothelioma or infantile hepatic hemangioma. It is a highly vascular tumor. These tumors can be solitary, multiple or diffuse. Most are discovered as an abdominal mass in the first six months of life. They can lead to congestive heart failure and rarely to Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, a rare disease, in which the vascular tumor leads to decreased platelet counts and bleeding disorder.
AFP levels are mostly normal. UltrasoundOn ultrasound a well-perfused tumor is seen. It can be hypoechoic or of mixed echogenicity. Unlike adult hepatic hemangiomas they are not echogenic. Calcifications are common.
Large arteries and veins are seen and the aorta may be wider than normal due to the large demand of the tumor and tapers distal to the celiac axis. VideoA three-month-old girl with a tumor in the left abdomen.

On unenhanced CT calcifications are present in approximately half of the patients. After intravenous contrast the tumor shows peripheral enhancement with gradual filling-in. In larger tumors the center may not enhance at all. MRIOn MRI a hemangioendothelioma has generally low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2. After contrast the same filling-in is seen as on CT. 
Most tumors will show spontaneous involution, and the prognosis is good. Images
Scroll through the images. It is the same tumor as on the ultrasound.
Mesenchymal hamartoma:
Mesenchymal hamartomas are usually multicystic liver lesions, although they can rarely be solid. They are often large at presentation. Serum AFP levels are normal. Ultrasound will show a multicystic lesion. MRI will demonstrate this as well. After Gadolinium some stromal enhancement can be seen. Example 1
The image is of a two-year-old boy, who presented with a painless swelling of the abdomen. Ultrasound shows a large multicystic mass at the caudal side of the liver. Continue with the MRI. T1 weighted fat suppressed coronal MRI provides a better overview of the liver lesion, which was almost 2 kilograms at resection. Pathology showed a mesenchymal hamartoma. No further follow-up was necessary. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Example 2A four-month-old boy presented with an abdominal mass. Ultrasound showed a mass from the caudal part of the right liver lobe, extending into the pelvis. The mass is not hypervascular. MRI shows a large tumor at the caudal site of the liver, extending to the bladder. 
After Gadolinium there was very fast enhancement, almost a arteriovenous shunting. The mass was thought to be a hemangioendothelioma. 
Biopsy was done and pathology was compatible with a mesenchymal hamartoma. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Hepatoblastoma:
Hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant liver tumor in young children, while hepatocellular carcinoma presents in older children, mostly in their teens. [7].
Hepatoblastoma usually presents with an enlarged abdomen. Ultrasound will generally show a well demarcated tumor. In larger tumors necrotic cysts and calcifications can be seen. CT angiography is done preoperatively to define the relation between the tumor and the hepatic vessels. MRI will better delineate the tumor. A hepatoblastoma has low signal intenstity on T1 and mixed signal intensity on T2. After Gadolinium patchy enhancement is seen. Example 1A two-year-old boy presented with a swelling in the abdomen.
On ultrasound a large solid tumor was seen in the upper abdomen. Some calcifications are present. The mass probably originates from the liver. It slides over the right kidney.
Continue with the MRI. MRI shows a solid hepatic mass with multiple small cysts. After contrast injection the mass is seen to be limited to the right posterior and anterior section, bordered by the middle hepatic vein (arrow). The mass has moderate diffusion restriction. Biopsy was compatible with an epithelial hepatoblastoma. Enable Scroll

Hepatocellular carcinoma:
This disease is rare in young children but can be seen in older children, mostly >10 years of age, although it has even been reported in children of five years of age. Underlying disease which predispose to HCC include hepatitis B and Tyrosinemia. Tyrosinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by the failure to break down tyrosine, a building block of most proteins. Tyrosine and its byproducts will build up in organs and can lead to liver and kidney failure and an increased risk for HCC. The tumor presents with abdominal mass, pain, or jaundice. AFP levels are elevated (although usually less elevated compared to AFP levels in hepatoblastoma). Example 1A seventeen-year-old girl presented with upper quadrant abdominal pain. On ultrasound a large liver tumor was detected. 
On MRI a tumor in liver segment 5 and 6 is seen with satellite lesions in segment 7 and 8 (arrows). There is a tumor thrombus in the right portal vein (arrowhead), and several lung metastases (*).
Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin:
There are two main types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma more commonly manifests with cervical lymph node enlargement and mediastinal masses, while it is rarely confined to the abdomen. Non-Hodgkin is more commonly located in the para-aortic and mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen (table). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma presents more frequently with extra nodal disease than Hodgkin lymphoma. For staging of Hodgkin lymphoma the Lugano classification is used  [9], and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma the International Pediatric NHL staging system [10]. Ultrasound
On ultrasound enlarged lymph nodes are very hypoechoic. The almost anechoic aspect of the tumor is typical of malignant lymphoma. If the bowel is affected the layering of the bowel wall is lost. MRI
On MRI masses are seen with some enhancement after Gadolinium and remarkable strong diffusion restriction. Another tumor that can show this marked diffusion restriction is a neuroblastoma, however these tumors are often much more heterogeneous with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage PET-CT
18-F-FDG PET-CT is used for staging. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Example 1This video is of a thirteen-year-old boy with cervical and mediastinal locations of a Hodgkin lymphoma. Sonographic examination of the abdomen demonstrates multiple enlarged hypoechoic paraaortal lymph nodes, which is typical for Hodgkin lymphoma. Example 2A 12-year-old girl presented with a large mass in the abdomen. Ultrasound could not define an organ of origin. MRI shows a large mesenterial mass and diffuse infiltration of the omentum. Notice the marked diffusion restriction of the omentum, which makes a lymphoma the most likely diagnosis. This was confirmed by pathologic examination. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Example 3 A four-year-old suffered from hypertension. His kidneys were enlarged and ultrasound showed a striated appearance of the papilla and hypoechoic areas in the cortex. There were also enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Pathologic examination demonstrated a Burkitt lymphoma.
Leukemia:
Leukemia is the most common malignancy in children. It can present with abdominal involvement. Leukemia can affect all solid abdominal organs.
The organs can be diffusely infiltrated or have a more nodular pattern. The kidneys are affected in almost half of the patients with later stages of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It can be uni- or bilateral, and there can be focal lesions or diffuse infiltration. The last has a rather typical appearance with a striated pattern around the calices, like in malignant lymphoma. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Example 1 An eight-year-old girl presented with weight loss and severe pain in the legs. 
An ultrasound examination had shown multiple lesions in both kidneys. 
MRI demonstrates not only the renal tumors, but also a lesion in the pancreas, right iliac wing, left sacrum and multiple retroperitoneal lymphnodes. The diagnosis on imaging was malignant lymphoma but the final diagnosis turned out to be leukemia.
Germ cell tumor:
The majority of germ cell tumors in children occur in the testis and ovary, but they can arise anywhere in the body, including the abdomen. 
They develop from pluripotent stem cells, and therefore have variable cell lines. 
Often a mixture of benign and malignant cell lines is found. 
The most malignant component on pathologic examination determines the choice of therapy. The tumor can excrete alpha-fetoprotein and / or beta human chorionic gonadotropin. 
Abdominal germ cell tumors are diagnosed because of mass effects. 
The most common non-gonadal abdominal germ cell tumor is the sacrococcygeal teratoma. 
This entity is discussed on the page Cystic Abdominal Masses in Children. Germ cell tumors are generally part cystic and part solid. The more solid, the more malignant. [13]
On ultrasound solid tumors are often very inhomogeneous with cystic and solid parts. Calcifications are common. 
The mixture of cystic and solid parts suggests germ cell tumor. On
MRI calcifications are difficult to observe because they have a variable
signal on different MR sequences. They are mostly of low signal intensity and thus hard to notice,
but sometimes they may have high signal on spin echo T1 and T2.  
MRI can demonstrate fatty components in the tumor
which strongly suggests the diagnosis of a germ cell tumor. Example 1 A four-month-old boy with an abdominal swelling. Ultrasound shows a tumor with cystic and solid parts. Some echogenic foci are present (arrow). On MRI (not shown) fatty components were visible. At operation a teratoma of the stomach was resected. It was benign. Example 2 A six-month-old boy was suspected of having an intussusception. During the sonographic examination an intraabdominal tumor was seen. He was referred with the diagnosis of a neuroblastoma. Image
A lesion with a multi-layered wall, a cystic part and an echogenic part with a strong acoustic shadow is present. A germ cell tumor is more likely than a neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma generally has smaller calcifications.
Continue with the MRI. MRI T2 weighted axial image shows high signal intensity parts of the tumor, either fat or fluid. Fat
suppressed contrast enhanced T1W-image.
The
high signal parts are suppressed, which indicates that it is fat. Note
the close relation with the superior mesenteric artery which can be damaged
during operation. At operation a benign mature cystic teratoma was resected. Example 3 A sixteen-year-old girl presented with swollen legs. 
CT demonstrates a mass with fat, coarse calcifications and solid parts. 
The inferior caval vein was compressed. At operation a retroperitoneal mature cystic teratoma was resected.
Rhabdomyosarcoma:
Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are the most common soft tissue tumors in children and can develop almost anywhere but mostly in the
head and neck region, including the orbit and in the genitourinary tract. About 25% of all RMS arise in the lower abdomen, generally originating from the bladder, prostate or vagina, but they can arise almost anywhere, for instance along the biliary tract (where no striped muscle is present!). The most common pathologic subtype is embryonal RMS, followed by alveolar RMS. The
alveolar type has a worse prognosis. The
age of the patient, generally below 15 years and the location of the tumor in
the prostate, bladder or vagina will point towards the diagnosis, while the imaging features are non-specific. Example 1 A fifteen-year-old boy with a tumor with a small cystic part (arrow) is seen near the bladder. 
Balloon of a catheter in the bladder. MRI A
sagittal image shows a tumor anterior to the bladder neck. There
is patchy enhancement. 
DWI
showed strong diffusion restriction (not shown). The location of the tumor
makes a rhabdomyosarcoma the most likely diagnosis. The tumor was biopsied through an anterior approach over the pubic bone. Final diagnosis: Rhabdomyosarcoma American Cancer Society.

cannot be reliably distinguished from Wilms tumor at imaging, but some features
may suggest an alternative diagnosis, which in some cases can lead to the
decision to adjust the treatment or in some cases to perform a biopsy before start
of pre-operative treatment. The role of imaging in children with a possible renal tumor is first to determine whether the mass originates in the kidney.
The next step is to look for signs that would make you consider an alternative diagnosis instead of a Wilms tumor.
The final step is staging. In this article we will discuss common and some less common renal tumors and include some malignancies that can appear as a primary renal tumor, like lymphoma, neuroblastoma and leukemia.
Introduction:

Role of Imaging:
Claw sign
Claw sign:
This sign in renal tumors is useful in determining that the tumor arises from the kidney rather than is located adjacent to the kidney and distorts the outline. The claw sign refers to the sharp angles on either side of the mass, which the surrounding normal parenchyma forms when the mass has arisen from the kidney. Images

The remnant of the kidney is draped over the tumor, the “claw sign”.
Management:
Imaging plays a limited role in determining the exact nature and management of a renal tumor in children, since almost all pediatric renal tumors will be resected and most tumors will be a Wilms tumor.
Age at presentation is a far more important predictor of tumor type. 0-6 months-old Besides Wilms tumor, the
differential diagnosis comprises two tumors that occur predominantly in
infants: congenital mesoblastic nephroma and rhabdoid tumor of the kidney
(MRTK). Both tumors are treated with primary resection. Therefore, renal tumors
in infants below six months are primarily resected if possible. 6-months – 9 yearsA renal tumor in children in this age group is considered a Wilms tumor without histological confirmation. >9 yearsIn children above 9 years-old in most cases a primary nephrectomy is performed. 
A renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is more common in this age group than a Wilms tumor. This table summarizes the features of pediatric renal tumors. Some of these pediatric renal masses may be differentiated from a Wilms tumor on the basis of their clinical and imaging features.
Wilms tumor:
Nephroblastoma in a five-year-old boy. More than 90% of renal tumors in children are Wilms tumors, also called nephroblastomas. Wilms tumor presents mostly in children between 6 month and nine years of age with a peak incidence from 2 to 3 years. Wilms tumors are generally very large at initial diagnosis and these children present with a distended abdomen.
Children with Wilms tumor are generally not ill. case 1The coronal T2W-image shows an inhomogeneous tumor in the left kidney with small cystic
 components.
The tumor enhances less than the peripheral remnant
 of normal renal tissue.
The solid parts of the tumor show strong diffusion
 restriction (arrows).
This was a Wilms tumor in a five-year-old boy. Pre-operative chemotherapy was given according to the Umbrella protocol of the SIOP-RTSG after which a nephrectomy
was performed. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome:
Smaller tumors can be detected when haematuria, abdominal pain, or hypertension with headache is the presenting symptom or during sonographic screening in children with syndromes which predispose to nephroblastoma, like Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, WAGR, Perlman
syndrome, DICER 1 and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Bilateral nephroblastomas are often genetic or syndrome-related. Small tumors are usually homogeneous echogenic.
Larger tumors are more inhomogeneous with cystic necrotic parts and hemorrhage.
10% of nephroblastomas have fine calcifications. The lungs are the most frequent site of metastases.
Liver and bone metastasis are rare. case 2

MR findings:
Wilms tumors are mostly inhomogeneous, with decreased signal intensity on T1 and increased signal intensity on T2. 
Necrotic cystic parts are often present.
Enhancement after Gadolinium is inhomogeneous and less than the enhancement of normal renal parenchyma. The solid parts of the tumor will show restricted diffusion. 
Signs of hemorrhage are often present. Hemorrhagic areas will also show restricted diffusion, so look at the T1 for signs of bleeding. MRI can nicely demonstrate tumor thrombus in the renal vein and inferior caval vein, as well as lymph node enlargement. It allows accurate and repeatable measurements of the tumor 3-dimensional, on the original and follow-up examinations. case 3This MRI is of a three-year-old
girl with a tumor of the right kidney.

This video is of a three-year-old

Notice the tumor thrombus in the inferior caval
 vein. Once you are sure of the renal origin of the tumor, scrutinize the other kidney for tumor or nephroblastomatosis (see below).
Search for enlarged para-aortal lymph nodes.
Search with color Doppler for patency of the renal vein and of the inferior caval vein, as a Wilms tumor tends to grow into the renal vein and inferior caval vein. The finding of a liver metastasis should urge you to consider an alternative diagnosis.
Staging and surgery:
Surgery is the cornerstone for the treatment of WT. 
The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) from North America recommends surgery before chemotherapy, whereas SIOP in Europe suggests preoperative chemotherapy. 
As the SIOP group, the National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) has concerns about performing a biopsy first because of the risk of tumor upstaging. The SIOP recommends preoperative chemotherapy to decrease the risk of intraoperative rupture, downstage the tumor, and to reduce the need for irradiation. 
The advantage of preoperative chemotherapy is the identification of chemoresistant high-risk blastemal predominant subtype that benefits from treatment intensification. This is the short version of Wilms tumor staging.
Nephroblastomatosis:
A
kidney can harbor a nephrogenic rest, which is persisting embryologic tissue. 
If
multiple rests are present it is called nephroblastomatosis. 
Most nephrogenic
rests resolve spontaneously, but they may transform into a Wilms tumor. On
ultrasound Wilms tumor is difficult to detect as these lesions tend to
show similar echogenicity compared to the renal cortex. ImagePersistent
nephroblastomatosis in a seven-year-old boy who was treated five years ago for
a Wilms tumor. A peripheral rim of echogenic tissue is seen. These
residual lesions are followed up with regular ultrasound untill 5 years after
treatment. Microflow imaging can help to identify hypoperfused areas with nephroblastomatosis. Images

Patient
was treated with pre-operative chemotherapy after which the tumor on the left
side was resected through partial nephrectomy. The diffuse
nephroblastomatosis was treated with monthly gift of AV (Actinmycin D and
Vincristin) chemotherapy for one year.
Congenital mesoblastic nephroma:
Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Congenital mesoblastic nephroma is almost always a benign renal tumor that can be detected antenatally.
It is the most common neonatal renal tumor and most are detected before the age of one year.
The young age of the patient will strongly suggest this tumor. On imaging there are no clear characteristics to distinguish it from a Wilms tumor, although a whirlpool aspect of the tumor on ultrasound may suggest a congenital mesoblastic nephroma.
The tumor is treated with nephrectomy. video
In
a newborn boy the obstetrician palpated a tumor in the abdomen.
Ultrasound
showed a large mass in the upper pole of the right kidney. The video suggests a
whirled aspect of parts of the tumor. Continue with the MRI. MRI
The tumor has similar signal intensity as normal
 renal tissue on all pulse sequences.
It enhances also equal to the remnant of the kidney. The kidney was excised and contained a
 mesoblastic nephroma.
Multilocular cystic renal tumor:
Cystic nephroma A
multilocular cystic renal tumor is a confusing lesion. 
It can be a benign cystic nephroma, or a malignant cystic partially differentiated
nephroblastoma. 
Only the pathologist can make the difference. The radiologist
has to distinguish these multilocular cystic tumors which arise from the kidney
with preservation of some normal renal tissue from a multicystic dysplastic
kidney where no normal renal tissue is visible. ImagesUltrasound and MRI of a four-year-old boy with a multilocular cystic lesion
 in the interpolar region of the left kidney (arrow).
 It was detected as an incidental
 finding at the age of nine months. On follow-up no change was seen. The
 lesion is consistent with a cystic nephroma, a benign condition.
The same lesion is seen on the T2 weighted transverse
 image. Cystic nephroma These images are of a one-year-old girl.  
On ultrasound a multicystic tumor was seen with some perfusion of
 septa. T2 weigthed image better shows the extent of the
 lesion. A remnant of the normal renal tissue of the lower pole is visible,
 distinguishing it from a multicystic dysplastic kidney. This tumor was diagnosed as a cystic nephroma for which
right nephrectomy was performed. Multicystic dysplastic kidney An 8-months-old boy with a multicystic dysplastic
kidney. 
On ultrasound multiple cysts are present and no
normal renal tissue is seen. 
No additional imaging is needed. 
Often follow-up
ultrasound is performed to ascertain regression of the MCDK over time and to
diagnose contralateral abnormalities (in 30% of cases).
Malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney:
Malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney with brain (arrows) and bone metastases Malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney is a highly
 malignant tumor with a poor
 prognosis. 
Distant metastases at the time of diagnosis of the tumor are
 common, to the lungs, liver, brain, lymph nodes, and skeleton. Rhabdoid renal tumors can occur in conjunction with a brain tumor, which can
 be a primary atypical teratoid rhabdoid brain tumor (ATRT), but also other tumors
 like medulloblastoma and ependymoma are described. There are no distinguishing features from a Wilms tumor,
 but one should think of a rhabdoid tumor if the tumor is relatively small
 with an infiltrative growth pattern, low T2 signal and diffusion restriction. Although rhabdoid tumors are reported to demonstrate
 a subcapsular fluid collection, this can occur also as an uncommon
 manifestation in Wilms tumor, but these collections occur in absolute
 numbers more in Wilms tumor than in rhabdoid tumors. Images

 left kidney.
A MRI of the brain at the time of initial diagnosis
 showed tiny lesions, possibly metastases (arrows).
An MRI four weeks later
 showed multiple brain and skull metastases. 
The patient died two weeks later.
Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney:
Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Clear
cell sarcoma of the kidney is rare, approximately 3% of pediatric renal tumors. The 5-year survival rate is around 80% but it is worse in children below one
year of age.
The tumor has a propensity to metastasize to the bone. The combination of a renal tumor and bone metastases
should suggest to the diagnosis of a clear cell sarcoma. The imaging findings are non-specific, but suggestive
features are that these tumors are generally homogeneous with limited diffusion
restriction. video A ten-month-old boy presented with an
abdominal mass. Ultrasound demonstrated a tumor in the right kidney. This is
better shown on MRI. The remnant of the kidney has a dilated collecting system.
On ADC images there is limited diffusion restriction.
Histopathology showed a clear cell sarcoma of the
kidney. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. On
ADC images there is limited diffusion restriction. The
tumor was thought to be a Wilms tumor, because of the limited
diffusion restriction, but pathology showed a clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.
Renal cell carcinoma:
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
is the second most common renal tumor in children. RCC is rare in young
children and occurs mostly in children older than 10 years. It can also occur in
patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, or
after treatment for previous malignancies (f.e Neuroblastoma or Leukemia) Image
A nine-year-old boy presented with severe hematuria. 
On palpation a left abdominal mass was found.  
On ultrasound a predominantly solid mass was seen which seemed to invade the dilated collecting system. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. On imaging renal cell carcinomas can present in many different ways.
They can appear more solid or have cystic elements and may be homogeneous, or rather heterogeneous.
Hemorrhage can occur and they may contain fat.
Relative small tumor size and prominent peripheral vessels suggests a RCC. Imaging is essential for staging and a combination of ultrasound, CT and MRI is used. video
MRI
nicely demonstrates the mass in the left kidney. Note the large collateral
veins.
Because
of heavy hematuria a left nephrectomy was performed. 
Pathology showed a RCC which
was completely resected.
Lymphoma:
Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. There
are two main types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin
lymphoma often manifests with cervical lymph node enlargement, and mediastinal
masses. 
It is very rarely confined to the abdomen. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be
located solely in the abdomen and generally originates from a bowel loop.
Non-Hodgkin
lymphoma presents more frequently with extra-nodal disease than Hodgkin
lymphoma. 
Kidney involvement in lymphoma is rarely seen, but imaging features
to look for are multiple focal lesions that are homogeneous and hypoechoic on ultrasound and show strong diffusion restriction on MRI. 5,6 video
Ultrasound
of a three-year-old boy. Diffuse infiltration of both kidneys was seen.
Furthermore, multiple hypoechoic masses were detected
in pancreas, liver and bowel.
The combination of bowel
involvement and high LDH in de serum was highly suggestive for Burkitt
lymphoma. This diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy and flow
cytometry.
Leukemia:
Leukemia is the most common malignancy in children.
It can affect all solid abdominal organs.
Organs can be diffusely infiltrated
 or have a more nodular pattern. The kidneys are affected in almost half of the
 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
It can be uni- or bilateral, and
 there can be focal lesions or diffuse infiltration with enlargement of the
 kidneys. The latter has a rather typical appearance
 with a striated pattern around the calices, similar to renal involvement of
 malignant lymphoma (figure). Image
A
four-month-old boy presented with fever and anemia with thrombopenia. An
ultrasound examination shows enlarged kidneys with multiple hypo-echoic
lesions and linear abnormalities in both kidneys. 
Retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy was seen as well.
A hematological malignancy,
in particular leukemia was suspected due to the combination of imaging findings
and laboratory findings. Continue with the video... Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Distinguishing between malignant lymphoma and leukemia on imaging is difficult, when a lot of extramedullary disease is seen. Often the final diagnosis
is thus based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings (anemia and
thrombocytopenia) and flow cytometry. For this case the final
diagnosis was leukemia.
Neuroblastoma:
Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. The
main differential diagnosis of nephroblastoma is neuroblastoma. Typical
features that indicate neuroblastoma are calcifications - causing a specific
ultrasound pattern, shown in the video – and vessel encasement,
without invasion. 
This vessel encasement causes the aorta and caval vein to
be lifted anteriorly. On ultrasound the tumor is generally inhomogeneous and
echogenic, with bright calcifications. Children
with neuroblastoma are generally very ill, while children with a Wilms tumor are not. 
The Vanillyl Mandelic Acid (VMA) and HomoVanillic Acid
(HVA) levels in the urine are in most cases elevated.
In our hospital these levels are checked in every child that presents with a tumor in the abdomen. video

In this section we will discuss the sonographic features used to evaluate Crohn’s disease. After reading this section, you will be able to: Press ctrl+ for larger images and text on a PC or ⌘+ on a Mac. Most images can be enlarged by clicking on them.
Introduction:
Crohn’s disease is a chronic, recurrent inflammation of the bowel wall of unknown origin. 
The disease has a tendency for transmural progression with ulceration, abscesses, fistula formation, fibrosis and (intermittent) luminal obstruction. Although Crohn’s disease can involve the entire gastrointestinal tract, colon and ileocecal region are the most frequently involved areas. Patients with Crohn's disease often have longstanding, insidious and atypical symptoms leading to serious diagnostic delay of months to even years.  
On the other hand, ileocecal Crohn disease may also present acutely with appendicitis-like symptoms or small bowel obstruction. 
In both scenarios US can play an important role in making the correct diagnosis. Apart from primary detection, US  is also useful in:
Normal US anatomy:
The US architecture of the normal bowel wall has a typical five-layered morphology of alternating echogenicity, closely corresponding to the histological layers of the bowel wall. This US architecture is essentially identical from the stomach to the rectum. 
The normal US anatomy is outlined in the section Ultrasound of the GI tract - Normal Anatomy
US signs of ileocecal Crohn’s disease:

Bowel wall thickening:
In ileocecal Crohn’s disease, typically all bowel wall layers are involved, and the normal stratification is often locally disturbed. US shows marked mural thickening, predominantly in the terminal ileum, but cecum and appendix can also be involved. Bowel wall thickening is most prominent in the hyperechoic submucosal layer, representing deposition of fat and fibrous tissue as a result of chronic bowel inflammation (4). Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Using graded compression, two adjacent bowel segments are compressed against the iliopsoas muscle. The ventral segment is normal and is easily compressed, while the Crohn’s loop can hardly be compressed. Measuring bowel wall thickness is best and most reproducibly performed during compression, as here in a normal individual (left) and in a patient with Crohn’s disease (right). Measurements are performed from outer contour of the muscular layer to the opposite side, and then divided by 2, resulting in a wall thickness of 1.5 mm and 6.5 mm for normal resp. Crohn ileum. 
See also the section Ultrasound of the GI tract - Normal Anatomy.
Transmural signature:
Commonly, at first presentation, US already reveals the characteristic transmural “signature” of Crohn’s disease. This transmural progression is recognized as focal, hypoechoic changes (*) in the otherwise hyperechoic submucosa, closely correlating with endoscopic findings and active inflammatory histologic changes (4). This 18-year old man was admitted with acute appendicitis-like symptoms and immediate CT was performed. 
CT revealed evident ileal bowel wall thickening and a normal appendix (not shown here). Subsequent US showed the typical characteristic transmural hypoechoic changes in the hyperechoic submucosa confirming Crohn’s ileitis. Note the superior image resolution of US compared to CT. In patients with manifest active Crohn’s disease, the normal US architecture of the bowel wall may be lost diffusely. Note the hyperechoic fatty tissue (fat) around the ileum, representing the inflamed mesentery and omentum, trying to wall off the imminent perforation.  
In cases like this, the altered morphology and luminal narrowing may mimic malignancy.
Skip lesions:
One of the features of Crohn’s disease is the patchy way it affects bowel. 
This results in skip lesions,  where large parts of the bowel are left unharmed. The affected parts show a relatively sharp demarcation, the transition from normal (small arrows) to abnormal bowel (large arrows) being rather abrupt.
Ulceration:
Bright eccentric foci within the hypoechoic areas are air-configurations representing deep ulceration, here depicted in two different patients. 
These transmural ulcerations herald sinus tract formation, abscesses and fistula formation.
Note the partially surrounding inflamed fat, representing mesentery and omentum, at this point effectively walling off the imminent perforation.
Sinus tract formation:
Air-configurations reaching beyond the peripheral borders of the bowel wall definitely indicate sinus tract formation. Here an example in two different patients.
Abscess:
Actively inflamed terminal ileum with a moderately demarcated hypoechoic area outside the bowel wall, surrounded by inflamed fat, indicates sinus tract and abscess formation. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Two patients with Crohn’s abscesses close to the ileum. 
Note that abscesses in Crohn’s disease are often small and collapsed. The explanation for this phenomenon  is that these abscesses usually have an open connection to the ileal lumen, allowing pus to immediately evacuate to the bowel lumen when pressure goes up.
Fistulas:
Ultimately sinus tract formation may proceed to  fistula formation. Here two examples of entero-enteric fistulization (arrowheads). Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Fistula (arrowheads) from the terminal ileum to the appendix (arrows) in advanced ileocecal Crohn’s disease.
Note the hyperechoic fat, surrounding the fistula complex, representing omentum and mesentery effectively walling off a possible imminent perforation to the peritoneal cavity. 
Due to its slow and insidious character, free perforation in Crohn’s disease is very rare. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Crohn abscess with bladder fistula
Two different patients with known Crohn’s disease who now both presented with micturition symptoms. In the left patient there is an abscess with secondary thickening of the bladder wall (arrowheads), in the right patient an enterovesical fistula is “in state of birth”, with massive thickening of the bladder wall (arrowheads). Note that in 80 % of entero-vesical fistulae the cause is underlying diverticulitis while underlying cancer is the cause in 15 %.  
Crohn’s disease is the third cause with about  5 %. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Ultimately sinus tract and abscess formation may result in a fistula. 
The most frequent targets are small bowel, sigmoid and appendix.  
Unusually, fistula to the bladder, the abdominal wall and iliopsoas muscle may occur. 
In situations with complex enterocutaneous fistula involving multiple small bowel loops, CT or MRI enterography is the ideal modality  (post-contrast T1 MRI), for pre-operative mapping and in follow-up, as in this patient. In patients with such a complex anatomy, US plays a less important role than CT and MRI. See also: Crohn's disease- Evaluation with MRI.
Stenosis and prestenotic dilatation:
Inflammatory bowel wall thickening or the ensuing fibrotic strictures may finally result in luminal narrowing, stenosis and bowel obstruction. 
The affected segment typically demonstrates dysfunctional motility.
In case of acute abdominal symptoms, US can demonstrate the presence of prestenotic dilatation and therefore proves symptomatic stenosis. This young woman with known Crohn’s disease had intermittent colicky attacks that were never documented with imaging. She was asked to come back immediately during an attack  to undergo US Now US demonstrated marked prestenotic dilatation proximal to a short segment of abnormal ileum (arrowheads). Higher up there was another stenotic segment. Since there was no reaction on medical therapy, this was considered a fibrotic stenosis and this patient underwent successful surgery. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Here a fibrotic stenosis in an ileal segment. Note the prestenotic dilatation and  absence of  peristalsis at  the level of the stricture (arrows). In stenosing Crohn’s disease with long episodes of chronic recurrent small bowel obstruction, an interesting phenomenon in ileal loops may be observed, i.e. hypertrophy of the muscular layer. 
This so-called “inflammation-smooth muscle hyperplasia axis” may be the most important factor in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s strictures. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll
Creeping Fat:
In longstanding Crohn’s disease, “creeping fat” can be found, which is hypertrophied mesenteric fat “wrapped around” the affected bowel, most frequently in the ileocecal region. It is recognized as a rather well-delineated, moderately compressible,  fatty mass surrounding most of the circumference of the ileum, iso-echoic or slightly hyperechoic to normal fat. 
During compression a “feather-like” pattern can be observed. Old and inactive Crohn’s disease of the terminal ileum in a now asymptomatic patient. Note prominent thickening of the hyperechoic third layer, representing fatty deposition and loose connective tissue in the submucosa. Here an example of appendiceal involvement in ileocecal Crohn’s disease. Note prominent echolucent wall thickening of both terminal ileum and appendix (arrowheads).
This is not a true obstructive appendicitis and appendectomy should be avoided. 
After medical therapy, there was normalization of both ileum, cecum and appendix on US. In most patients with ileocecal Crohn’s disease the appendix (arrow) is normal (A) or only minimally reactively thickened (B). In some patients (C)  with ileocecal Crohn’s disease, slight transmural changes in the appendix submucosa (*) indicate Crohn’s  involvement of the appendix. In D. there is severe involvement of ileum, cecum and appendix (arrow), with abundant surrounding inflamed fat. Crohn’s involvement of the appendix in ileocecal Crohn’s disease is not an indication for appendectomy. It should not be confused with true, obstructive appendicitis. If appendectomy is done in active ileocecal Crohn’s disease, the result may be a fistula. See * on US and ➛ on bariumstudy. The fistula is located between the cecal pole and the terminal ileum (arrowheads). Isolated primary Crohn’s appendicitis is rare but it does exist. 
In this patient there was transmural inflammation (*) and inflamed fat, indistinguishable from ordinary appendicitis.
Appendectomy is usually performed in such cases.
In truly isolated primary Crohn’s appendicitis there are seldom recurrences after appendectomy.
Differential Diagnosis:

Infectious ileocolitis:
One of the most important differential diagnosis is infectious colitis. 
The main symptoms of infectious colitis are severe, often bloody diarrhoea,  especially in Campylobacter and  Salmonella colitis. 
Other causative micro-organisms are E. coli, Shigella and several viruses. US reveals mucosal and submucosal thickening and hyperemia of the entire colon, which is impossible to differentiate from ulcerative colitis. Since in every patient with suspected IBD,  repeated stool cultures are performed,  the correct diagnosis is not a problem in most cases.
Right-sided infectious ileocolitis:
In a small group of patients, especially young adults, the bacterial infection for unknown reasons may initially remain limited to ileum and right colon. 
These patients present with prominent RLQ pain and have no or only mild diarrhoea. 
This right-sided infectious ileocolitis may therefore present with symptoms mimicking appendicitis or ileocecal Crohn’s disease, and thus may lead to unnecessary surgery. 
US plays an important role in the timely diagnosis. The causative bacteria are Campylobacter (80%) and Salmonella (20%). 
In the past, Yersinia was a frequent cause of  infectious ileitis, closely mimicking Crohn’s disease both clinically and on US. 
However, the incidence of Yersinia has strongly decreased over the last three decades and is seen only very rarely nowadays. Enable Scroll

CT scan without contrast (history of severe allergy). Prominent (sub)mucosal wall thickening of ileum and right colon. 
Note also markedly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and normal appendix. Typical, prominent image of the ileocecal valve in infectious ileocecitis due to (sub)mucosal thickening of both ileum and cecum. The ileocecal valve is visualized in two planes, perpendicular to each other (note body scheme). As clinically observed in Campylobacter patients, pain in Campylobacter ileocecitis is often intermittent and crampy in nature. 
During these crampy pain attacks (remember “Crampylobacter”), the ileum is slightly intussuscepted into the cecum, sliding back again after the attack. Differentiating Crohn’s disease and infectious ileocolitis is usually easy, as in the latter the layer structure is virtually always intact and  there is never inflamed fat, abscess or fistula formation. Differences between Crohn’s disease and infectious ileocolitis. However, differentiation of early Crohn’s disease from infectious ileocolitis, can at times be difficult to impossible. 
Follow-up and repeated stool cultures in such cases can solve the problem. In this young patient, USfindings were compatible with both early Crohn’s ileitis and right-sided infectious ileocolitis. 
Repeated US after 7 days waspathognomonic for Crohn’s disease. 
Note that both wall thickening and surrounding inflamed fat have markedly increased in volume (arrowheads).
Tuberculous ileitis:
In this patient from Indonesia with  RLQ pain, the tentative US diagnosis of Crohn’s disease was made. A chest X-ray however revealed active tuberculosis, so the most likely diagnosis was tuberculous ileitis. 
Follow up US after tuberculostatic therapy showed complete resolution of the abnormalities. Tuberculous ileitis can closely mimic Crohn’s disease, and even show abscesses,  fistula formation and fibrotic stenosis.
Typhoid ileitis:
This Dutch student  presented with high fever, constipation and RLQ  pain after returning from India. 
US showed splenomegaly and wall thickening of the terminal ileum (arrowheads) with evident hypoechoic transmural changes (*). 
There was also inflamed fat around the ileum and the mesenteric lymph nodes (ln) were enlarged. Two days later, blood cultures were positive for Salmonella typhi. 
Complete recovery with antibiotics. 
S. typhi is the only bacteria that shows this invasive behavior and may very closely mimic the US features of Crohn’s disease. 
In endemic areas, ileal perforation is a frequent complication of typhoid fever. Clostridium colitis - (colon tr. = transverse colon) Clostridium colitis may mimic the US features of ulcerative colitis, although the (sub)mucosal  wall thickening in Clostridium colitis is usually much more prominent. The clinical findings may at times be quite confusing and Clostridium colitis may also occur without previous antibiotic therapy. This young patient developed severe diarrhea, several days after antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection. 
Colonoscopy was suspect and eventually stool cultures were positive for Clostridium difficile.
Ischemic colitis:
Ischemic colitis has a predilection for the splenic flexure of the colon since that is  the watershed area of superior and inferior mesenteric artery supply. US findings of sharply demarcated, segmental, hypoechoic wall thickening with transmural features and fat stranding may closely mimic Crohn’s colitis, both on US and CT. Location, age and atherosclerosis, together with the clinical picture usually give the clue. Ischemic colitis Note the abrupt transition of normal and abnormal colonic wall (arrowheads) mimicking skip lesions as in Crohn’s disease. Clinical findings as well as the atherosclerotic origin of the SMA (arrow) give the clue here.
Bowel malignancy:
In patientswith segmental bowel wall thickening and loss of the normal US architecture, active Crohn’s disease may mimic malignancy. 
Yet, in the majority of the cases, the US appearance of the adenocarcinoma is quite typical. In this 52-year old man the classic appearance of an adenocarcinoma of the descending colon was found by US. 
Longitudinal view shows a short segment ofirregular, asymmetrical, hypoechoicbowel wall thickening with loss of layer structure, especially at the ventral side. 
Note that dorsally the wall is relatively intact.In the transverse view, the proximal segmentof colonis normal, more distally prominent hypoechoic wall thickening suggests tumor. Not only the relatively hypoechoic tumor itself is not compressible, but also the surrounding hyperechoic fat (arrowheads), representing desmoplastic reaction. Irregular, circumferential wall thickening of the cecum with loss of layer structure and ill-defined borders, separating it from the surrounding inflamed fat. 
It was impossible here to differentiate Crohn from malignancy. 
On the subsequent CT scan, malignancy was considered more likely. 
Colonoscopy revealed cecal carcinoma. Sometimes, the US image can be quite confusing. 
In this patient, the irregular, asymmetrical wall thickening of the cecum with adjacent inflamed fat (*) and  encroachment of the appendix (arrow) suggested malignancy with desmoplastic reaction and ingrowth in the base of the appendix. Concomitant wall thickening of the terminal ileum and especially the transmural changes (arrowhead) in the distal appendix, suggested the correct diagnosis of ileocecal Crohn’s disease with involvement of the appendix. An important pitfall is secondary thickening of the terminal ileum due to advanced  appendicitis. 
In these two different patients  (who both turned out to have appendicitis),  prominent wall thickening of the ileum initially raised the suspicion of Crohn’s disease or right-sided infectious ileocolitis. 
Further US searching brought to light that this was reactive thickening due to an underlying inflamed appendix (arrow). When the appendix is not visualized in such cases, secondary wall thickening of the ileum may be misinterpreted and may lead to serious delay of surgery. 
In doubt, CT can be very helpful.
Role of US in Crohn’s disease:
Crohn’s ileitis with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (ln), and a normal appendix (arrows)
Primary detection:
The main role of US in Crohn’s disease is primary detection in patients who are submitted for US with an unclear diagnosis. These patients have either very atypical chronic symptoms of pain and/or diarrhoea or they present with  appendicitis-like  symptoms or small bowel obstruction. This 28-year old man with a blank medical history, presented with RLQ pain since 24 hours, suspect for appendicitis. 
US and subsequent CT showed a completely unexpected Crohn’s ileitis with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and a normal appendix. Not infrequently, Crohn’s disease may even be a coincidental finding in a patient, who at that time, has no abdominal symptoms at all. 
This 32-year old lady presented with severe LLQ pain and a CRP of 20. 
In the LLQ, US revealed a locally painful mass of inflamed fat next to the sigmoid (s.), suspect for epiploic appendagitis. During screening (“mowing-the-lawn”) in the RLQ an abnormal terminal ileum (il.) was found with all US features of Crohn’s disease. 
The patient denied any present or previous symptoms other than the actual pain in her LLQ, which subsequently subsided within a week. CT confirmed left-sided epiploic appendagitis (arrowheads) and Crohn’s ileitis. 
In the following years, this patient did actually develop active, albeit rather mild, symptomatic Crohn’s disease, without  abscess or fistula formation.
Monitoring disease activity during medication:
US can also be used for monitoring disease activity during medical therapy for Crohn’s disease, particularly in circumscribed Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum or colon and in well-circumscribed and reproducible  lesions. Compare the severely affected terminal ileum in this young patient with the US image after 8 months of medical therapy. 
Note that both wall thickening and  the mass of acutely inflamed fat around the ileum did decrease (arrowheads). Monitoring disease activity in response to medical therapy at the level of  the terminal ileum. There is convincing decrease in wall thickening after 4 weeks of medication. 
Note subtle residual hypoechoic, transmural changes (*) still visible  in the near wall after therapy.
US in abscess drainage:
Although MRI and CT are essential in delineating Crohn’s abscesses and in treatment planning, US can be helpful in guiding abscess drainage. In this obese patient, US with gtraded compression was useful to safely guide the needle to this deeply located abscess.
After insertion of a guide-wire, an 8-Fr pigtail-catheter could easily be placed under fluoroscopic control.
Crohn colitis vs ulcerative colitis:
Finally, US may play a role in the differentiation of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s colitis. 
On clinical grounds and even with the help of endoscopy and biopsies, it can at times be difficult to differentiate Crohn’s colitis from ulcerative colitis.  
In these cases, US can be of help: the demonstration of hypoechoic, transmural inflammation and the presence of non-compressible inflamed fat strongly favor Crohn’s disease. PitfallIn severe ulcerative colitis, there may be increased echogenicity of the surrounding fat (*), as here in this young pregnant lady. This fat is rather well-compressible, and should be considered as edema associated with secondary hyperemia rather than as a sign of true transmural inflammation. 
Note marked wall thickening of the transverse colon (arrowheads) in the panoramic view. We thank Lars Perk, gastroenterologist, for his critical evaluation of the manuscript.

Endometriosis - MRI detection:
Jan Hein van Waesberghe, Marieke Hazewinkel and Milou Busard
Radiology department of the VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2011-11-01 Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. MRI is helpful in determining the extent of deep infiltrating endometriosis, especially when laparoscopic inspection is limited by adhesions. In this article we will focus on the diagnosis and preoperative assessment of endometriosis using MR imaging. You can enlarge images by clicking on them. This item is not available on the iPhone application.
Introduction:
Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It is mainly found in the abdominal cavity, most commonly on the surface of the ovaries. It is an estrogen-dependent disease and is estimated to occur in 10% of the female population, almost exclusively in women of reproductive age. The most common symptoms are dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, and infertility - although it may also be asymptomatic. Click on image for enlarged view The symptoms depend on the localization of the endometriosis, the depth of the infiltration and whether the endometriosis is complicated by adhesions. The illustration shows the typical localizations of endometriosis:
MRI-protocol:
If the only reason for performing MRI is to determine the presence or extent of endometriosis, the sequences listed in the table on the left are sufficient. Lesions usually demonstrate low to intermediate signal intensity on T2- and T1-weighted images. In some cases punctate foci of high signal intensity are seen on T2-weighted imaging, indicating dilated endometrial glands. Foci of high signal intensity may be seen on T1-weighted images. If these foci also have a high signal intensity on T1-weighted images with fat saturation, it indicates the presence of hemorrhage. T1-weighted images with fat saturation are necessary to differentiate blood in endometriomas from fat in mature cystic teratomas, since both show high signal intensity on T1-weighted images without fatsat. If the questions that need answering are more diverse, for example in cases of suspected malignancy, T1- and T1-fatsat sequences before and after the administration of intravenous gadolinium may supplement this protocol. Diffusion-weighted imaging may also be added.
Superficial endometriosis:
Small superficial endometriotic plaque at laparoscopy In superficial endometriosis – also known as Sampson's syndrome – superficial plaques are scattered across the peritoneum, ovaries and uterine ligaments. These patients tend to have minor symptoms and usually also less structural changes in the pelvis. At laparoscopy, these implants may be seen as superficial powder-burn
or gunshot lesions. Coronal T2 and T1-Fatsat images: superficial serosal implants of endometriosis On MRI these lesions are most often not visible because they are tiny and flat, and therefore undetectable. Only when they exceed 5mm or when they appear as hemorrhagic cysts, showing high signal intensity on T1 and low signal intensity on T2-weigthed images, they may be detected (figure). Neither transvaginal ultrasound nor MRI are sufficiently sensitive to screen for these endometriotic plaques.
Deep pelvic endometriosis:
Sagittal T2-weighted images demonstrating endometriosis infiltrating the rectum and endometriosis infiltrating the bladder In deep pelvic endometriosis - also called Cullen's syndrome - there is subperitoneal infiltration of endometrial deposits. The symptoms are more severe and related to the localization and depth of invasion. MRI is of use for the diagnosis of deep infiltrating endometriotic lesions and for the assessment of disease extension. Preoperative mapping of disease extension is important to decide whether surgical intervention is indicated, and if so, for planning complete surgical excision. Endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac with infiltration of the rectal wall
Cul-de-sac localization:
The cul-de-sac is the most common site of pelvic involvement. Presence of deep infiltrating endometriosis in the cul-de-sac can be easily overlooked at laparoscopy due to the creation of a false peritoneal floor by endometriosis in the pouch of Douglas, partly caused by anterior rectal wall adhesions. This phenomenon gives an erroneous impression of extraperitoneal orgin. Consequently, the location of the deep infiltrating endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum may also be a misnomer as the rectovaginal septum is located caudal to the posterior vaginal fornix and, on the basis of normal anatomy, may therefore not be a primary site for endometriosis to develop. This differentiation between normal anatomy and the presence of endometriosis in the cul-de-sac is readily made using MRI. This sagittal T2-image shows deep infiltrating endometriosis in the
posterior cul-de-sac with infiltration of the rectal wall.
Uterus:
The torus uterinus - where the sacrouterine ligaments attach - and posterior fornix are common localizations of endometriosis. Clinically these patients often present with dyspareunia. Endometriosis involving the torus uterinus T2-images of endometriosis involving the torus uterinus. Retrocervical endometriosis T2-images showing deep infiltrating endometriosis in the posterior fornix and torus uterinus. There is no infiltration of the bowel wall. Endometriosis with involvement of the left sacrouterine ligament T2-weighted images demonstrating involvement of the
left sacrouterine ligament. Rectal endometriosis
Bowel involvement:
Bowel endometriosis affects between 4% and 37% of women with endometriosis. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the first line of investigation in patients with suspected bowel endometriosis. Additionally, MRI can determine the depth of bowel wall infiltration, the length of the affected area and the distance of the lesion from the anus. The T2-images demonstrate two fan-shaped hypointense lesions (red arrows). These findings are typical for endometriotic lesions infiltrating the muscular layer of the bowel wall. There is also some submucosal swelling, seen as hyperintensity on the luminal side of the bowel wall. Rectal stenosis due to endometriosis In case of circular involvement, extensive deep infiltrating endometriosis of the bowel wall can lead to stenosis of the bowel lumen. Patients may clinically present with pencil-like stool or constipation. The T2-images show focal stenosis of the rectum as a result of circular endometriotic involvement. Bladder wall endometriosis
Bladder involvement:
The urinary tract is involved in only 4% of women with endometriosis of which around 90% involve the bladder. The T2-images show endometriosis infiltrating the bladder wall. Bladder wall endometriosis The sagittal T2-image shows full-thickness bladder endometriosis with isointense signal compared to muscle and foci of high signal intensity, indicating dilated endometrial glands. The fatsat T1-image shows small cysts with hyperintense signal within the lesion caused by hemorrhage. LEFT: Coronal T2WI: kissing ovaries due to adhesions RIGHT: Coronal T1WI+FS demonstrating small hemorrhages (red arrows)
Adhesions:
Endometriosis is frequently complicated by adhesion formation. On MRI adhesions can be seen as spiculated, low- to intermediate
signal intensity strandings on T1 and T2. Adhesions can fixate the pelvic organs, leading to posterior displacement of uterus and ovaries, elevation of the posterior vaginal fornix and angulation of bowel loops. They may also lead to hydronephrosis, although in most cases hydronephrosis is caused by fibrosis secondary to the endometriosis. The T2- and fatsat T1-images on the left show a patient with endometriosis in whom the ovaries are stuck together ('kissing ovaries'), as a result of extensive adhesion formation. In this patient a small hemorrhagic cyst of the left ovary and a hemorrhagic superficial plaque are also shown (high signal on T1 red arrows). Endometriosis complicated by hydronephrosis These T2-images show dilatation of the left distal ureter caused by extensive deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the left sacrouterine ligament extending to the sigmoid colon.
Endometriomas:
Endometrioma at ultrasound and laparoscopy Endometriomas - also known as chocolate cysts - develop when superficial endometriotic lesions on the surface of the ovary invaginate. Blood produced by such an implant during each menstrual cycle cannot escape and will accumulate within the ovary, forming a cyst known as an endometrioma. Endometriomas present as complex cystic masses, often thick-walled with a homogeneous content. On transvaginal ultrasound, endometriomas may be seen as thick-walled
cysts with low level echoes. On the left a transvaginal ultrasound image and the corresponding laparoscopic image during cystectomy. T2- and fatsat T1-images of an endometrioma with hypointensity on T2 (shading), fluid-fluid levels on T2 (left) and hyperintense blood on T1WI with fatsat (right).. On MRI, endometriomas present as solitary or multiple masses
with a homogeneous hyperintense signal intensity on T1- and T1-fatsat sequences. The T1-fatsat helps differentiate endometriomas from mature cystic teratomas, which usually contain fat. On T2WI, endometriomas may range from having a low signal intensity (also known as shading) to an intermediate or high signal intensity. The low signal intensity reflects the hemoconcentration of a cyst. Endometriomas generally have a thick, fibrous capsule with low signal intensity on T2, caused by hemosiderin-laden macrophages (figure). Endometrioma (yellow arrow), hydrosalpynx (red arrow) and leiomyoma (blue arrow). These images are of a patient with an endometrioma of the right ovary (yellow arrow). It demonstrates intermediate signal on T2 and high signal intensity on T1-fatsat. In addition there is: Endometrioma On the left another example of an endometrial cyst. The T2- and fatsat T1-images show a cyst with a
bloodclot (hypointense on T2, intermediate on T1). Sometimes these clots are accompanied by fibrotic tissue at histopathology. They may be recognized as irregularly shaped, hypointense lesions (on T2) found in the dependent portion of the endometrial cysts. In this case there is also a hematosalpinx (curved arrow). Endometrioma The T2- and fatsat T1-images on the left show an endometrial cyst of the left ovary. The wall of the cyst is hypointense on T2WI and T1WI caused by hemosiderin.

The differential diagnosis of endometrial cysts includes: hemorrhagic
functional cysts, fibrothecoma, cystic mature teratoma, cystic ovarian neoplasm and ovarian abscess. Click on the links below for more information about the differential diagnosis. Ovarian Cystic Masses I Roadmap for Diagnostic Work up

Abdominal wall endometriosis:
Abdominal wall endometriosis presenting as ill-defined hypo echoic mass. Endometrial implants have been reported in many unusual sites outside the pelvis including the chest. Abdominal wall endometriosis is the most common location of extrapelvic endometriosis and usually occurs after cesarean section. Sonography shows a solid hypoechoic lesions in the abdominal wall , frequently containing internal vascularity on power Doppler examination. These sonographic findings are nonspecific, and a wide spectrum of disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis including neoplasms such as a sarcoma, desmoid tumor, or metastasis and nonneoplastic causes such as a suture granuloma, hernia, hematoma, or abscess. However, abdominal wall endometriosis should always be your prime concern in patients with an abdominal wall mass nearby a cesarean section scar. Abdominal wall endometriosis The CT and MR characteristics of abdominal wall endometriosis are nonspecific, both showing a solid enhancing mass in the abdominal wall. On the left MR-images of a patient with abdominal wall endometriosis. On T2WI, the lesions have an isointense signal to muscle with small foci of
high signal intensity, indicating dilated endometrial glands. They have a slightly higher signal intensity to muscle on the fatsat
T1-image (arrow). Abdominal wall endometriosis A characteristic clinical symptom of abdominal wall endometriosis is cyclic pain associated with the menses, but patients may also present with continuous pain or no pain at all.

Swallowing disorders update:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Alrijne Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2018-08-13 Swallowing is a complex movement. It requires the coordination of nerves and muscles in the buccolabial area, the tongue, the palate, the pharynx, the larynx and finally the esophagus. Radiographic studies of patients with swallowing disorders can help to analyse the problem. In this article a systematic approach on how to analyse these videos is presented by focussing on four basic findings: Aspiration Normal Swallowing
Normal Swallowing:
LEFT: Oral or preparatory phase. RIGHT: Transport to pharynx and subsequent triggering of the actual swallowing reflex.
Oral phase:
In the oral phase food is prepared for swallowing and then transported to the pharynx. This is a preparatory phase in which the food is held within the mouth while the base of the tongue and the soft palate close the oral cavity posteriorly to prevent food spilling into the open larynx and trachea. A bolus is formed in the central portion of the tongue and then pushed posteriorly toward the pharynx with an anterior-to-posterior tongue elevation. As the bolus enters the pharynx the actual swallow or pharyngeal reflex is triggered. LEFT: Pharyngeal constrictors push the bolus down. RIGHT: Together with the contraction of the inferior constrictor, the cricopharyngeus relaxes.
Pharyngeal phase:
This phase is a reflex action. The bolus passes through the pharynx quickly and then enters the esophagus. This takes place in less than a second. The initiation of this process starts when the bolus passes the anterior faucial arch and reaches the posterior pharyngeal wall. Elevation of the soft palate prevents material from entering the nasal cavity. This stage is followed by the pharyngeal constrictor muscles pushing the bolus further into the pharynx, toward the cricopharyngeal sphincter. The larynx prevents material from entering the trachea by respectively closing the true vocal cords, false vocal folds, and aryepiglottic folds. Contraction of the lower pharyngeal constrictor is followed by relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscle, allowing the bolus to pass into the esophagus. Enable Scroll

4. The hyoid bone elevates and the larynx closes (green arrow). The tongue pushes the food downwards, while the upper esophageal constrictor contracts.
5. Contraction of the middle pharyngeal constrictor (yellow arrow), while the cricopharyngeus is already fully relaxed (green arrow).
6. Contraction of the lower pharyngeal constrictor emptying the pharynx.
7. Epiglottis elevates to regain its resting position and the larynx opens (arrow).

Disable Scroll The AP-view is important to look for asymmetry. Once the series of the pharyngeal phase has been acquired, follow the contrast bolus all the way down to the gastroesophageal junction.
Indications for a study:
Indications for a swallowing study are dysphagia, globus sensation and aspiration. Dysphagia is a general term used to describe the inability to transport the food properly from the mouth to the stomach.
Globus sensation is a term to describe the feeling, that there is something in the throat, that is in the way or needs to be swallowed.
Aspiration is the most severe form of swallowing disorders and can result in aspiration pneumonia, chronic lung disease or choking. In some patients with chronic lung disease a swallowing study can be performed to look for 'silent aspiration'.
Study of Swallowing:
The radiologist is explaining how to perform the modified valsalva First try to find out exactly what the patients problem is, so you can customize the series. Is there a risk of aspiration, i.e. wet voice, recurrent pneumonia or aspiration? If so, do not start the examination with barium contrast, but instead use non-ionic water-soluble contrast. If during the first few swallows there is no aspiration, you can switch to barium, as this gives better quality images. Before we start the examination, the procedure is explained to the patient and we practise certain manoeuvres like the modified Valsalva (figure). When solid food is the problem, you may want to add a solid substance to the barium - for instance biscuits or bread with bariumpaste. The patient in the video only has problems with solid food. The examination of patients with a possible swallowing disorder consists of: Start with one or two lateral swallows followed by a lateral double-contrast view of the pharynx (see later). Then an AP-swallow is recorded followed by an AP double-contrast view of the pharynx. Next the passage through the esophagus is recorded, sometimes followed by double-contrast views of the gastroesophageal junction. Always start with the lateral view first!
Fluorographic study of the actual swallowing:
The act of swallowing is recorded on video or some sort of digital recording. We use grabs from the fluographic images and store them into the PACS-system, where we can play the images back and forth in slow motion. It is very important to always start with the lateral view first, because if the patient aspirates, the lateral view will tell you how and why it happened. If you have to stop the examination, the most important images will already have been recorded. If you start with an AP-view and the patient aspirates, you may have to stop the examination and you will never know why aspiration occurred and what the problem is. If a patient is unable to stand or sit, you can still do a lateral view. Use only a small amount of barium for the first swallow and if the patient is doing fine, coninue with larger portions. Aspiration of a small amount of barium is usually not a big problem, but you don't want a lot of barium filling the bronchi. LEFT: Lateral view during singing aaa. Hyoid (H) and tongue base (T) move anteriorly. Left and right pyriform sinuses are projected on top of each other. Tip of soft palate (SP) is seen. RIGHT: Valleculae (V) and pyriform sinuses (P).
Double contrast images of the pharynx:
For the lateral view, ask the patient to sing an aaa, as this will move the tongue in an anterior position and give a better view on the oro- and hypopharynx. In Dutch this will be the letter eee, as it is pronounced the same as the english aaa. For the AP-view the modified Valsalva manoeuvre is performed. The patients has to blow air through the tightened lips as in trumpet-playing, while relaxing the neck region. Always practise this manoeuvre prior to the examination, so the patient knows what to do. On the left DC views of the pharynx. Outpounching of the lateral wall of the pharynx is normal and can be quite severe (Dizzy Gillespie). These are called 'lateral pharyngeal ears'. Cricopharyngeal hypertrophy in a patient with reflux.
Examination of the esophagus:
Always follow the passage of barium through the esophagus until it enters the stomach. Disorders of the gastroesophageal junction are often experienced as a problem within the throat. The rationale for this is that in patients with a distal obstruction, gastroesophageal reflux or a motility disorder, the cricopharyngeal muscle has to work very hard to prevent foodspillage back into the pharynx - along with the risk of aspiration. This increased muscle tone gives the patient the sensation that there is something in the throat. The images are of a patient with globus sensation. This was due to severe reflux and subsequent increased tone of the cricopharyngeal muscle. A large paraesophageal hernia with reflux is the cause of the complaints. Optimal views of gastro-esophageal junction when air regurgitates from the stomach into the coated esophagus in a patient with a sliding hiatus hernia. Excellent views of the gastroesophageal junction can be achieved by doing the following: You get the best lighting, when the anterior part of the cervical spine is in the middle of the image. Do not put the contrast bolus in the center of the image, because on the video you'll get a constant shift of images that are too dark to images that are too bright.
Analyzing swallowing studies:
A simple way to analyse a swallowing study is to concentrate on four easily detectable findings: These findings are mostly already apparent during the examination, but analysis of all the images will clarify the mechanism that causes these abnormal findings. These imaging findings may be isolated findings or may be related to each other. For instance, premature closure of the cricopharyngeal muscle may lead to stasis of contrast in the pharynx, which may result in aspiration as the larynx opens at the end of swallowing. Asymmetric swallowing due to head turn. The head is turned to the left and contrast is only seen in the right food channel.
Asymmetry:
Asymmetric swallowing on an AP-view is usually the result of an asymmetric tilting of the epiglottis. Sometimes it is caused by rotation of the head, but in many cases no real explanation is found. Even when the head is not rotated, the epiglottis can tilt asymmetrically when it hits the posterior pharyngeal wall. This is more likely to occur when only a small bolus is given, as the pharynx will not fully distend. A larger bolus will result in a symmetric swallow. In the case on the left rotation of the head closes the side to which the head is turned (Figure). If a patient has a unilateral pharyngeal paresis, turning of the head towards the affected side will help the patient in preventing aspiration. By turning the head towards the affected side, this side will be closed preventing stasis on this side and possible secondary aspiration. However before you decide that it is a normal finding you have to exclude a pharyngeal tumour or unilateral paresis. The double-contrast views can be helpful in these cases. In unilateral paresis the paralysed side will protrude during the modified Valsalva. When a tumour is present in the pharynx, it is usually visible on the DC views. Sometimes endoscopy is necessary to solve the problem of an asymmetric swallow. Asymmetry (2) The case on the left is an odd case, but it nicely demonstrates the difficulty that sometimes exists in determining the cause of asymmetry. On the far left asymmetry is seen on the fluorographic study (green arrow). It looks as if there is something in the right pyriform sinus. On the double contrast view on the right the pyriform sinus is normal (green arrow), but at the level of the vallecula on the right a lobulated proces is seen (yellow arrow). At a higher level a smooth indentation of the oropharynx is seen (blue arrow). The lobulated tumor at the level of the valleculae proved to be remnants of the lingual tonsil, which is a common finding and sometimes difficult to differentiate from cancer of the tongue base. Continue with the CT of this patient. Impression of the oropharynx by an elongated internal carotid artery (blue arrow.). Compare to the position of the carotid artery on the left The CT image shows that the smooth indentation of the oropharynx on the right was caused by an elongated internal carotid artery. So indeed this is an uncommon case in which on the fluorographic study a tumor was suspected in the pyriform sinus. Finally a proces was found within the oropharynx and a proces compressing the wall from outside at a higher level. Due to these processes there was an asymmetric passage of contrast in the hypopharynx simulating a proces in the pyriform sinus. Here another patient with an elongated internal carotid artery. This patient had swallowing problems and at inspection a pulsating structure was seen in the oropharynx. This is not un uncommon finding. So before you perform a biopsy in this area make sure that you are not dealing with the carotid artery. Stasis of contrast at the level of the pyriform sinuses (blue arrows) with subsequent aspiration (yellow arrows)
Stasis:
Stasis is the result of insufficient cleansing of the pharynx, either due to an obstruction- i.e. dysfunction of the cricopharyngeus or tumor or due to insufficient contraction of the pharyngeal constrictors. Insufficient contraction is the result of pharyngeal paresis resulting from a neuromuscular disorder. Excessive movements of the tongue base and larynx are sometimes seen on lateral fluorographic studies to compensate for the loss of function of the pharyngeal constrictors. When the patient resumes breathing, aspiration can occur (Figure). Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Stasis (2) Here a set of images demonstrating a patient with a paresis of the pharynxconstrictors. This is usually associated with insufficient relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscle. In this example we can see how the patient tries to compensate for the loss of pharyngeal constriction by excessive movement of the tongue and the head. This patient is in extreme stress, because he knows that when he starts breathing and the throat is not empty, he will aspirate. In some of these cases cricopharyngeotomy is the only solution to facilitate the passage of food to the esophagus. Small impression of the cricopharyngeus. No obstruction.
Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction:
Insufficient opening and premature closure are the most common problems of the cricopharyngeal muscle. Normally you should not see an impression of the cricopharyngeus during passage of the bolus, but a small non-obstructive indentation is sometimes seen and is not clinically significant (Figure). It can however sometimes explain the symptoms of the patient. It is assumed that the passage of food irritates the mucosa that covers the cricopharyngeal muscle resulting in a globus sensation. LEFT: small pouch. MIDDLE and RIGHT: true Zenker's diverticulum due to premature closure of the cricopharyngeus (yellow arrow)
Zenker's diverticulum:
A Zenker's diverticulum is always the result of cricopharyngeal dysfunction. Premature closure of the cricopharyngeus results in an increased pressure in the hypopharynx, just above the cricopharyngeus, as the pressurewave of the pharyngeal constrictors pushes the bolus downwards. This increased pressure can result in an outpouching at a weak spot in the posterior pharyngeal wall (Killian's dehiscence). First this will result in a small pouch, that in time can increase and form a true Zenker's diverticulum (Figure). Enable Scroll

The digital recordings nicely demonstrate the filling of a large Zenker's diverticle. The contraction of the lower pharyngeal constrictors is indicated by the blue arrow. The contraction of the lower pharyngeal muscle against the closed cricopharyngeal muscle causes the posterior outpouching, just above the contracted cricopharyngeal muscle (yellow arrow). Cricopharyngeal dysfunction (4) Here a video of a patient with a Zenker diverticulum. Notice that on the AP-view the patient keeps on swallowing because of the globus sensation. Aspiration before, during or after the actual swallow.
Aspiration:
There are three instances when aspiration can occur: before, during or after the actual swallow. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Aspiration before swallowing When tongue or soft palate are unable to prevent spillage of food into the pharynx, aspiration may occur since the larynx is still open. Weakness of these muscles in the mouth and the throat is due to paralysis or myopathy. We have to assume that a failure of the sensory nerves in the pharynx is the problem. Notice also that there is no coughing reflex. This patient probably has silent aspiration. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Aspiration during swallowing This is due to an insufficient closure of the larynx when it should be closed. Closure of the larynx is a result of anterosuperior lifting of the larynx which allows the true cords, false cords and finally, the aryepiglottic folds to contract, followed by a backwards folding of the epiglottis over the closed larynx. The aryepiglottic folds are the main gatekeepers, while the epiglottis plays only a minor role in preventing aspiration. Both failure of these intrinsic muscles of the larynx as well as failure of the extrinsic muscles (i.e. muscles that lift the larynx) may lead to aspiration during swallowing. Weakness of the extrinsic muscles is seen after radiotherapy, in neurologic disorders and in recurrens nerve paralysis (i.e. neuromuscular dysfunction). Notice that this patient has diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) with syndesmofytes at many levels on the anterior side of the cervical spine. However they are not the cause of the swallowing disorder. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Aspiration during swallowing Aspiration during swallowing (2) On the left a digital recording of a patient who complained of a sore throat and a wet voice. Notice that when the contrast enters the throat, the swallowing reflex is not triggered immediately. This allows for barium contrast to enter the larynx, where it sits on the vocals cords. Once the swallowing reflex is initiated, the larynx closes properly, but contrast is already in. Notice also that while the contrast enters the larynx, it does not initiate a cough reflex. Althoug the digital recording perfectly explains the complaints of the patient, it is difficult to say what causes this problem. Usually when there is aspiration during swallowing, the problem is at the level of the larynx. Mostly it is the larynx that is unable to close either due to weakness of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles or weakness of the extrinsic muscles that lift the larynx and allow it to contract (for instance after neck radiation or surgery). In this case the problem is probably at the level of the sensory nerves in the pharynx, who are not triggered properly. You could also argue, that this maybe is aspiration before swallowing, because it happens before the actual swallowing reflex. Maybe a more forcefull push of the bolus posteriorly from the mouth into the oropharynx could help in triggering these nerves instead of allowing the bolus to slide over the back of the tongue. Aspiration after swallowing This is the most common cause of aspiration. It is the result of stasis of contrast in the pharynx due to insufficient contraction of the pharyngeal constrictors or insufficient opening of the cricopharyngeal muscle or an obstructing web or tumor. When the larynx opens the contrast may leak into the trachea. The patient in the video aspirates due to stasis in the hypopharynx. In this video there is massive aspiration due to stasis as a result of insufficient contraction of the pharyngeal constrictors and insufficient opening of the cricopharyngeal muscle.
Web:
Webs are mucosa folds which are usually located anteriorly in the hypopharynx or upper esophagus. Liquids usually pass well, but in many cases a 'jet' is seen. The passage of solid food may produce irritation or damage to the mucosa, resulting in a globus feeling. They are best diagnosed on the lateral projection of the barium swallow. Here another example of a web. Webs are frequently overlooked at esophagoscopy unless special attention is given to this area. During esophagoscopy they may rupture, but in many cases recurrence is seen.
Pharyngeal ears:
Outpounching of the lateral wall of the pharynx are called 'lateral pharyngeal ears'. Sometimes patients complain of globus sensation or that small food particles or pills get stuck in their throat, but usually it is an incidental finding. They can be quite prominent as in Dizzy Gillespie the famous trumpet player. Two cases of pharyngeal ears.
Osteofytes:
Although osteofytes can be quite big, they hardly ever cause swallowing problems.
Esophagus pathology:
As mentioned earlier problems in the esophagus can give the sensation of a problem in the throat. In the video there is stasis of contrast in the proximal esophagus due to a large carcinoma. A common cause of swallowing problems is reflux which irritates the cricipharyngeal muscle and results in hypertrophy. The patient in the video has a large hiatal hernia with reflux and almost no peristatic movements in the esophagus. Here three patients with swallowing problems as a result of esophageal pathology. The patient on the left has reflux esophagitis with a Barrett's esophagus. The patient in the middle has a esophageal cancer. The patient on the right has a stricture due to ingestion of caustic material.
Lingual tonsils:
The lingual tonsils are nodules of lymphatic tissue at the back of the base of the tongue (yellow arrow). They are similar to the adenoid or nasopharyngeal tonsil (blue arrow). Large lingual tonsils can be a cause of dysphagia or globus sensation especially if the tonsils compress the epiglottis. In many cases however they are incidental findings. Endoscopy is sometimes needed to differentiate large tonsils from a carcinoma at the tongue base. Notice that you have to look carefully to detect the large lingual tonsil.
Diagnosis:
The results of the swallowing examination help in establishing a final diagnosis. Based on this examination alone however, a specific diagnosis usually cannot be made, since most severe swallowing disorders are the result of a complex neuromuscular dysfunction. Hence the swallowing study should be regarded as part of the total evaluation of the patient by gastroenterologist, neurologist and speech therapist. The strength of the fluoroscopic examination is, that it is the only examination that can show us, what is really going on during swallowing and can therefore lead to a rehabilitation plan.
Swallowing Rehabilitation:
Swallowing rehabilitation is a specialty on its own. Here we will make some brief comments on rehabilitation as it may help you to better understand the dynamics of swallowing. In unilateral pharyngeal paralysis stasis can be prevented by closing down one of the lateral food channels by turning the head towards the affected side or by manually compressing it. Patients with aspiration before swallowing due to insufficient closure of the mouth, can be helped by flexing their head during chewing and thus holding the food in the anterior part of the oral cavity. In patients with aspiration during or after swallowing the 'supraglottic swallow' may help. Before swallowing a deep breath is taken. Air is prevented to leak out of the airways by compressing the vocal cords. Immediately after swallowing the patient has to cough forcefully in order to clear the airways and the throat from any residual food. Some patients only aspirate when they ingest fluids. These patients can be helped by changing their fluid intake into jelly-like liquids. by Nam-Jong Paik

Epilepsy - Role of MRI:
Publicationdate 2012-09-01 In many patients with epilepsy antiepileptic drug treatment is unable to control the seizures. Using a dedicated MRI-protocol, it is possible to detect an epileptogenic lesion in 80 percent of these patients. Resection of these lesions can lead to seizure freedom in many patients. We will discuss the MRI protocol and the typical findings in the most common epilepsy-associated diseases.
Introduction:

Common causes of Epilepsy:
The illustration summarizes the most common causes of seizures in patients with medically uncontrollable epilepsy. Some of these lesions are readily identifiable. Meso temporal sclerosis and focal cortical dysplasia are the most common causes and can only be depicted with a dedicated protocol. The table also summarizes epileptogenic lesions that are detected in patients with uncontrollable seizures. Mesial temporal sclerosis is the most common cause of intractable epilepsy. In medication refractory epilepsia the most common location of the epilectogenic lesion is temporal lobe (60%), frontal lobe (20%) and parietal lobe (10%), periventricular (5%) and occipital (5%).
Seizures and Epilepsy:
Seizures are common. About 4 percent of all people will have at least one seizure during their lifetime. In patients with a first ever seizure imaging will mostly show no brain-abnormalities, because the seizure is provoked by fever, drugs, dehydration or sleep deprivation. The term epilepsy is used, when there are recurrent unprovoked seizures. About 60 percent of patients with epilepsy can be controlled with antiepileptic drugs. Most patients with uncontrollable seizures have complex partial seizures. Partial seizures - also called focal seizures - are seizures which affect only a part of the brain at onset. They usually start in the temporal lobe. In simple partial seizures the person remains conscious. A simple partial seizure can be a precursor to a larger seizure and then it is called an aura. A complex partial seizure affects a larger part of the hemisphere and the person may lose consciousness. If a partial seizure spreads from one hemisphere to the other this will give rise to a secondarily generalised seizure. The person will become unconscious and may have a tonic clonic seizure.
MRI epilepsy protocol:
The table shows a dedicated epilepsy protocol. Some will also use Inversion Recovery and not use contrast on a routine base. T1WI
Superior for cortical thickness and the interface between grey and white matter. On T1WI look for grey matter occuring in an aberrant location as in gray matter heterotopia.
FLAIR Look very carefully for cortical and subcortical hyperintensities on the FLAIR, which can be very subtle. Since FLAIR may show false-positive results due to artefacts, the abnormalities should be confirmed on T2WI. 
T2* or SWI Helpful when searching for haemoglobin breakdown products as in posttraumatic changes and cavernomas, or to look for calcifications in tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber, cavernomas and gangliogliomas.
Mesial temporal sclerosis:
Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is a specific pattern of hippocampal neuronal loss accompanied by gliosis and atrophy. The etiology is unknown, but there is a relationship between MTS and prolonged febrile seizures earlier in life, complicated delivery and developmental processes. In 15% of patients another developmetal abnormality can be found, mostly focal cortical dysplasia. This is called dual pathology. MTS is the most common cause of partial complex epilepsy in adults and is also the most common etiology in young adult patients undergoing surgery. Surgical removal of visible MRI changes associated with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis leads to seizure freedom in up to 80% of cases. Right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis Coronal T2W and FLAIR images are the most sensitive for detecting MTS. On axial slices mesial temporal sclerosis is commonly overlooked. Bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis is difficult to detect due to the lack of comparison with the unaffected contralateral hippocampus. The coronal T2WI and FLAIR images show right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis. Notice the volume loss, which indicates atrophy and causes secondary enlargement of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. The high signal in the hippocamous reflects gliosis. Dual pathology: MTS and focal cortical dysplasia Mesial temporal sclerosis may occur in association with other pathology, especially focal cortical dysplasia. This is called dual pathology. The images show mesial temporal sclerosis with a hyperintense and shrunken hippocampus (red arrows), and secondary enlargement of the left temporal horn of the left laterale ventricle. Also notice associated subcortical hyperintensity in the left temporal lobe indicating focal cortical dysplasia. Left mesial temporal sclerosis. Subtle gliosis of left hippocampus (blue arrow) and atrophy (yellow arrow). 35-year-old patient with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. MR shows subtle hyperintensity of the left hippocampus on the axial FLAIR (blue arrow) and atrophy of the left hippocampus on coronal images (yellow arrow). Left mesial temporal sclerosis treated with amygdalo-hippocampectomy The patient was succesfully treated with amygdalo-hippocampectomy on the left.
Differential of hippocampal hyperintensity:
Hippocampal hyperintensity on T2WI or FLAIR images with volume loss is diagnostic for mesial temporal sclerosis in the appropriate clinical setting. Hippocampal hyperintensity without volume loss is seen in: Status epilepticus. Axial FLAIR, axial DWI and coronal T2WI. Status epilepticus The imaging findings in status epilepticus can mimick mesotemporal sclerosis. In status epilepticus a hyperintense hippocampus can be seen, but there is swelling and no atrophy. Axial FLAIR, axial DWI and coronal T2WI demonstrate a hyperintense hippocampus with a slightly compressed temporal horn of the lateral ventricle consistent with hippocampal edema. DWI shows diffusion restriction due to cytotoxic edema in the acute stage of the status epilepticus. Hyperintense hippocampus due to a DNET DNET mimicking mesial temporal sclerosis Axial T2WI shows hyperintense, but enlarged hippocampus with a bubbly appearance. This is typical for a DNET or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, which we will discuss in a moment. The coronal contrast-enhanced T1WI shows an enlarged hippocampus without uptake of contrast medium.
Focal Cortical Dysplasia:
key findings Focal cortical dysplasia is a congenital abnormality where the neurons fail to migrate in the proper formation in utero. MRI findings may be very subtle or may even be negative, therefore a high index of suspicion is mandatory! The most common findings are cortical or subcortical hyperintensities especially seen on FLAIR-images. These are often found at the bottom of a deep sulcus. Another finding is a blurred interface between grey and white matter, because the white matter looks a little bit like gray matter because it contains neurons that did not reach the cortex. Focal cortical dysplasia - coronal T1WI and FLAIR The images show typical focal cortical dysplasia. There is cortical thickening and blurring of the grey/white matter junction on T1WI (left). The FLAIR image on the right shows the subcortical hyperintensity. Dual pathology: MTS and focal cortical dysplasia The images demonstrate cortical and subcortical signal abnormalities on T2WI and FLAIR in the left temporal lobe indicating focal cortical dysplasia. Notice associated T2/FLAIR hyperintense and shrunken hippocampus as a result of mesial temporal sclerosis, i.e. dual pathology. Focal cortical dysplasia. Coronal T2WI Another case of focal cortical dysplasia. Notice the hypoplastic left temporal lobe with cortical thickening (arrow) and atrophy of the white matter. Focal cortical dysplasia. T1WI, T2WI and FLAIR. Axial T1WI, T2WI and FLAIR-images of a 15 year old boy with epilepsy. Notice thickening and hyperintensity of the cortex of the left superior frontal gyrus. The FLAIR-images also show high signal in the subcortical white matter. These findings are typical for focal cortical dysplasia. Focal cortical dysplasia in the right occipital lobe with transmantle sign
Transmantle sign:
Sometimes the hyperintensity is seen extending from the subcortical area to the margin of the ventricle. This is called the transmantle sign. This finding represents the arrested neuronal migration. Images of a 27-year-old male with refractory occipital lobe epilepsy. Coronal FLAIR and axial T2WI show T2-hyperintense cortical thickening and high signal in cortex and subcortical region. Notice subcortical hyperintensity extending to the right ventricle indicating transmantle sign (blue arrow). Focal cortical dysplasia - Transmantle sign. Transmantle sign seen in another patient with focal cortical dysplasia.
Cortical and glial scars - Ulegyria:
54-year-old patient with a history of perinatal asphyxia and longstanding refractory partial epilepsia. Left parietal scar in the parasagittal watershed area resulting in a shrunken cortex. Cortical and glial scars usually result from meningitis or birth injury. Ulegyria is a specific type of scar. It is defined as cerebral cortex scarring due to perinatal ischemia. Ulegyria typically affects full term infants. In these infants there is greater perfusion to the apex of the gyri than to the cortex at the depth of the sulci. The resulting pattern is that of a shrunken cortex in which the deep portions of the gyri are more shrunken than the superficial portions, leaving pedunculated gyri on long stalks with a mushroom appearance. Ulegyria must be differentiated from microgyria. Ulegyria MR will shows tissue loss and gliosis underneath a shrunken cortex. The shrunken cortex is best appreciated on a 3D-T1WI because of its high resolution and the superior delineation of the cortex, while FLAIR will show the hyperintensity associated with the gliosis. Therefore always use the FLAIR-sequence to search for hyperintensities in an epileptic patient and subsequently correlate these findings with the cerebral cortex in the affected area on high resolution T1WI.
Cavernoma:
Cavernoma is also known as cavernous malformation or cavernous angioma. It is a benign low flow vascular malformation with a tendency to bleed. 75 percent occur as solitary sporadic lesions and 10-30 percent occur as multiple lesions. Cavernomas consist of locules of variable size that contain blood products in different stages of evolution which produces a popcorn appearance. A complete hemosiderin rim surrounds the lesion, but not when there is a recent bleeding. Unenhanced CT may show a hyperdense nodule or calcification, but in 50% of cases cavernomas will be occult on CT. T2WI and T2* gradient echo show multiple cavernomas. Notice the popcorn appearance with peripheral rim of hemosiderin on the T2WI. The lesions are almost completely black on the gradient echo due to blooming artefacts. T2* and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) markedly increase the sensitivity of MRI to detect small cavernomas. The five black dots in the left cerebral hemisphere on the T2* are also cavernomas and are not visible on the T2WI. Cavernoma with associated DVA (arrow). Cavernomas are associated with developmental venous anomalies (DVA's). The unenhanced CT shows a small calcification in the right lentiform nucleus. Enhanced CT shows a venous anomaly draining the cavernoma into the right internal cerebral vein. Coronal T2WI shows the venous anomaly as a curvilinear flow void. Cavernoma in the postcentral gyrus on T1WI, T2WI and SWI. Notice popcorn appeance and blooming artefact. Same patient. Notice the hemosiderin coating of the precentral gyrus consistent with superficial siderosis due to prior hemorrhage of the cavernoma (red arrowheads). CAA - Multifocal subcortical black dots in a older patient.
Differential diagnosis of microbleeds:
In patients with multiple small black dots the differential diagnosis is: Asymmetric microbleeds in peripheral location seen in normotensive older person with lobar hemorrhage.
CAA is commonly seen in demented patients.
* Hypertensive microhemorrhages Microbleeds in hypertensive patients younger than CAA (
Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) Posttraumatic hemorrhages in corpus callosum, subcortical white matter and brainstem. Diffuse axonal injury Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) A 46 year old biker presented with seizures after being hit by a car. CT-image shows only minimal subarachnoidal hemorrhage (arrow). MRI was performed several weeks after the injury because of a change in personality. T2*-images show multiple hemosiderin depositions at the interface between grey and white matter, consistent with diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Notice that the location of the microbleeds is different from the peripheral located CAA-bleeds.
Epilepsy associated tumours:
All brain tumors may present with epilepsy, but there are some typically epilepsy associated tumors. These tumours share the following characteristics: Ganglioglioma in the right occipital lobe presenting as a cystic mass with rim enhancement. Notice calcification on CT.
Ganglioglioma:
key findings Ganglioglioma is the most common tumor associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. Calcification is common in ganglioglioma and is an important distinguishing factor from DNET and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Ganglioglioma. T2WI and CE-T1WI Ganglioglioma in a young child. Note large cyst with enhancement of mural solid tissue. Ganglioglioma. T2WI and CE-T1WI Small cystic ganglioglioma with a small enhancing nodule. DNET: T2WI and FLAIR show characteristic bubbly appearance and swelling of affected gyri. Notice scalopping of the skull due to slow growth of the lesion.
DNET:
key findings DNET in typical cases present as a bubbly mass which expands the affected gyri. The bubbly cystic appearance is seen as small cyst-like intratumoral structures that are very hyperintense on T2WI. DNET. T2WI and T1WI DNET in an 11-year old boy presenting with refractory partial seizures. The tumor shows a characteristic bubby appearance and there is subtle scalopping of the skull. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma on coronal T2WI and a coronal and axial CE-T1WI.Notice characteristic meningocerebral enhancement (arrow)
Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma:
key findings Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a rare cause of temporal lobe epilepsy. Peritumoral edema may be seen in PXA, while it is not a feature of either ganglioglioma or DNET. Thickening and enhancement of the adjacent leptomeninges is highly characteristic but is not always present. When meningeal involvement is not present, than a pleiomorphic xanthoastrocytoma is indistinguishable from a ganglioglioma. LEFT: Normal infundibular recess of the third ventricle (blue arrow) , mamillary bodies (red arrow)RIGHT: Tuber cinereum hamartoma (curved arrow)
Hypothalamic hamartoma:
key findings Hypothalamic hamartoma is also known as diencephalic or tuber cinereum hamartoma. It represents nonneoplastic congenital grey matter heterotopia in the region of tuber cinereum of the hypothalamus. It is seen in infants presenting with seizures and precocious puberty.
Hemimegalencephaly:
Hemimegalencephaly. (Courtesy of Alessandra D'Amico) key findings T2WI shows right hemimegalencephaly. Notice the asymmetric skull and slightly enlarged lateral ventricle. Hemimegalencephaly is the only condition in which an increase in parenchymal volume is associated with an increase in ipsilateral ventricular volume. Left hemimegalencephaly with diffuse cortical dysplasia involving fronto-parietal regions (blue arrows) and diffuse white matter T2 hyperintensity Hemimegalencephaly is a rare disease characterized by hamartomatous growth of one cerebral hemisphere or part of it. Patients present with early seizures, macrocrania and severe developmental delay with contralateral hemiparesis. The thickened cortex may show a wide spectrum of abnormalities, such as lissencephaly, pachygyria or polymicrogyria. In the late stage, the involved hemisphere may atrophy due to constant seizure acitivity. Most of the affected children die in the first years of life because of status epilepticus. Hemimegalencephaly. Courtesy of Alessandra D'Amico CT and T2WI in a patient with a right hemimegalencephaly. There is dysplastic thick cortex and ventricular dilatation on the affected side. 9-y-old girl with refractory nocturnal epilepsy. MRI shows overgrowth of the left cerebral hemisphere. T1WI shows heterotopic gray matter lining the left lateral ventricle (blue arrow). In hemimegalencephaly it is important to exclude contralateral abnormalities, as these form a contraindication to hemispherectomy.
Rasmussen's Encephalitis:
Rasmussen's encephalitis. Axial FLAIR and coronal T2WI show atrophy of the left cerebral hemisphere with enlargement of the lateral ventricle. key findings Rasmussen's encephalitis is a progressive hemispheric atrophy of unknown origin. Patient develop an increasing frequency of seizures and progressive hemiplegia. Notice that, opposed to hemimegalencephaly, the smaller hemisphere is the site of abnormality, and the lateral ventricle is larger in the smaller hemisphere.
Tuberous Sclerosis:
Axial T2w shows multiple tubers and white matter abnormalities (fig. a: arrows) and subependymal nodules key findings in the brain Tuberous sclerosis or Bourneville's disease is an inherited condition characterized by the presence of hamartomas in many organs including angiomyolipoma of the kidney, cardiac rhabdomyoma and cortical and subependymal tubers in the brain. Some patients have lymphangioleiomatosis, a cystic lung disease seen in women. The classic clinical triad is focal epilepsy, adenoma sebaceum and mental retardation (mnemonic: fits, zits and nitwits). The cortical hamartomas are called tubers and are similar to cortical dysplasia. Subependymal nodules are small lesions protruding into the lateral ventricles. Sometimes they are calcified. Seizure surgery in TSC is contemplated if a particular tuber can be implicated in seizure activity, or if a subependymal giant cell astrocytomas obstructs the foramen of Monro causing hydrocephalus. CT of a patient with Tuberous Sclerosis shows multiple cortical and subcortical calcifications. Tuberous Sclerosis - courtesy of the American Journal of Neuroradiology. CT and MRI in a patient with Tuberous Sclerosis. There are multiple cortcal and subependymal nodules. The CT shows that most of the lesions are calcified. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) This is a tumor that develops from a subependymal nodule near the foramen of Monro. They have a poor prognosis because they lead to obstruction of CSF flow. They are characterized by marked enhancement and their typical location. Axial T2WI and T1WI-CE show a giant cell astrocytoma at the level of the left foramen of Monro causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Also notice tuber on the left. Sagittal T1WI post contrast shows a giant cell astrocytoma in the right foramen of Monro.
Sturge-Weber Syndrome:
Sturge-Weber. T2WI, SWI and CE-T1WI key findings Sturge-Weber is also called encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis. It is a vascular malformation with capillary venous angiomas in the face (port-wine stain), choroid of the eye and leptomeninges. Venous occlusion and ischemia lead to angiomatosis with cortical calcium deposition and atrophy Clinical features are seizures, hemiparesis, anopsia, mental retardation and port-wine stain. The MR-images show leptomeningeal angiomatosis which is mainly localized in the occipital lobes. Venous stasis and calcifications are best seen on the SWI. Sturge-Weber angiomatosis. CE-T1WI. Courtesy of Alessandra D' Amico MRI in patients with Sturge-Weber can show: Coronal MR-images of a patient with Sturge-Weber show leptomeningeal enhancement in the right posterior hemispere. Sturge-Weber angiomatosis. Courtesy of Alessandra D' Amico CT in a patient with Sturge-Weber shows huge cortical and subcortical tram-track calcifications involving the left posterior hemispere. Sturge-Weber. T2WI and CE-T1WI 4-year-old boy with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Notice atrophy of the left posterior cerebral hemisphere with leptomeningeal enhancement and thickening. Sturge-Weber. Axial FLAIR and CE-T1WI with fatsat. Diffuse choroidal hemangioma
Diffuse choroidal hemangioma:
In Sturge-Weber a vascular malformation of the choroid of the eye is seen. These patients present with buphthalmos (enlarged eye) due to increased intraocular pressure and hemianopsia. Eye abnormalities in a 4-year-old boy with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Notice FLAIR-hyperintensity (red arrow) and excessive enhancement of the wall of the left globe (blue arrow) consistent with a diffuse choroidal hemangioma.
Polymicrogyria:
key findings Polymicrogyria is a malformation due to an alteration of the cortical development in the late stage of neuronal migration. The deeper layers of the cortex form multiple small gyri with derangement of the normal lamination and sulcation. LEFT: normal RIGHT: polymicrogyria (arrow) The T1W-images show a comparison between normal lamination and sulcation on the left and polymicrogyria on the right (arrow).
Heterotopia:
Heterotopia: subependymal nodules (arrows). Heterotopic Grey Matter results from an arrested migration of normal neurons along the radial path between the ventricular walls (ependyma) and the subcortical regions. There are two types of heterotopia: subependymal and subcortical. The most common clinical presentation is intractable seizures. Heterotopia present as nodular foci of grey matter intensity on all sequences. They do not enhance. Heterotopia Images of a typical subependymal heterotopia.

Publicationdate 2011-03-06 Diabetes-related foot problems like osteomyelitis and Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy are associated with a high morbidity and high healthcare costs. A red hot foot in a patient with diabetic neuropathy is a diagnostic problem. In this overview we will focus on two questions: Is this a Charcot foot with superimposed infection? Overview
Overview:

Osteomyelitis versus Charcot:
Osteomyelitis: Osteomyelitis in a diabetic with neuropathy is infection of the bone that usually results from contiguous spread of a skin ulcer. Consequently, the most common location for osteomyelitis is not in the midfoot, but at the pressure points of the forefoot (metatarsal heads, IP joints) and in the hindfoot at the plantar aspect of the posterior calcaneus. To determine whether osteomyelitis is present, place a marker on the ulcer or sinus tract and track it down to the bone and evaluate the MR- signal intensity of the marrow (1). Active Charcot: Unlike osteomyelitis, Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is primarily an articular disease, which is most commonly located in the midfoot. In the early stage radiography will not demonstrate bone abnormalities, but MRI will show subchondral bone marrow edema. The subcutaneous soft tissues are not typically involved. Signal intensities on MRI will not discriminate between active Charcot Joint and osteomyelitis. Location, i.e. bone or joint and ulcer or not, are the clues to the right diagnosis. Chronic stage of Charcot:The chronic stage of Charcot no longer shows a warm and red foot, but the edema usually persists. Joint deformity, subluxation and dislocation of the metatarsals lead to a rocker-bottom type deformity in which the cuboid becomes a weight-bearing structure. The deformity of the foot with abnormal pressure distribution on the plantar surface coupled with reduced or loss of sensation, makes the foot vulnerable and leads to callus and blister formation aswell as foot ulceration. Charcot with superimposed osteomyelitis: Foot ulceration can subsequently lead to infections, such as cellulitis and osteomyelitis, and this may eventually lead to amputation. The simplest method to determine whether osteomyelitis is present is to follow the path of an ulcer or sinus tract to the bone and evaluate the signal intensity of the bone marrow (1). Osteomyelitis in chronic Charcot is usually located in the midfoot, while osteomyelitis in diabetic neuropathy without Charcot is usually in the forefoot and hindfoot.
Osteomyelitis:
While diagnosing osteomyelitis is important, it is unfortunately also difficult. Clinical and laboratory signs and symptoms are generally unhelpful. The clinical diagnosis relies on the identification and characterization of an associated foot ulcer, a method that is often unreliable. It is important to mark the skin or subcutaneous abnormality, i.e. ulcer or sinus tract and to find its relation to the area of bone abnormality. The probe-to-bone test, i.e. palpation of bone with a sterile blunt metal probe in the depths of infected pedal ulcers was thought to be highly correlated with ostemyelitis. In later studies, however, it had a relatively low positive predictive value (7). On plain radiographs, bone infection may not show up on the first 2 weeks and in a later stage the radiographic characteristics of neuro-osteoarthropathy and osteomyelitis overlap. In both cases there will be demineralization, destruction and periosteal reaction of the bones, particularly when neuro-osteoarthropathy presents at a later stage. Here, images of a patient with a small cutaneous defect and subcutaneous edema at the metatarsals. A secondary sign, an abscess, is shown in the forefoot, with high signal intensity on STIR, low or intermediate signal on intensity T1W, and ring-enhancement of the borders showing high signal intensity on T1+Gd.
Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy:
Acute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy of the midfoot Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is a degenerative disease with progressive destruction of the bones and joints. It is seen in patients with neurological disorders with sensory loss of the feet, including tabes dorsalis, leprosy, diabetic neuropathy, and other conditions involving injury to the spinal cord. In 1868 Jean-Martin Charcot gave the first detailed description of the neuropathic aspect of this condition in a patient with syphilis. Today, diabetes mellitus is the most common etiology associated with Charcot osteoarthropathy, with the joints of the foot and ankle being most commonly affected. Here an illustration with the key MR-features of acute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy: Chronic stage of Charcot osteoarthropathy The exact nature of Charcot arthropathy is unknown. The neurotraumatic theory states that Charcot arthropathy is caused by an unperceived trauma to an insensate foot. The sensory neuropathy renders the patient unaware of the osseous destruction that occurs with continuous ambulation. The neurovascular theory suggests that the underlying condition leads to the development of autonomic neuropathy, causing the extremity to receive an increased blood flow, which in turn results in a mismatch in bone destruction by increased osteoclastic activity and bone synthesis (1). The image shows a progressive neuro-osteoarthropathy of the tarsometatarsal joints (Lisfranc dislocation) with subchondral cysts, erosions, joint distention and dislocation. A hot red foot in acute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy
Acute Charcot:
Acute active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is defined by clinical signs. There should be neuropathy and a warm and swollen foot. The skin temperature should be 2?C or more at the site of maximum deformity of the affected foot compared with a similar site on the contralateral foot. Osteomyelitis should be excluded and fever is not present. Serum C-reactive protein level is normal or only a slightly elevated. The differential diagnosis is infection (osteomyelitis, cellulitis, septic arthritis), inflammation (gout, rheumatoid arthritis) and deep vein thrombosis. In this early stage, radiographic abnormalities are not present. The acute stage of Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy shows rapid and progressive bone and joint destruction within days or weeks. Immobility by total contact casting can prevent further bone and joint destruction. Here a radiograph of a patient with diabetic neuropathy and a red hot foot. In the acute stage, the radiographs are normal and may not exclude the diagnosis of acute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy. Within 4 months there is progressive decrease of calcaneal inclination with equinus deformity at the ankle. There is destruction of the tarsometatarsal joint with the typical rocker-bottom deformity. Bony debris is seen on the dorsal aspect of the foot. In the acute stage, MRI shows only subchondral bone marrow edema. Here MRI images of a patient with acute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy. The bone marrow edema typically is not restricted to one or two bones, but is seen in the entire midfoot. Bone marrow edema and its enhancement are typically centered in the subchondral bone, suggesting articular disease. The subcutaneous tissues are relatively normal and there is no ulcer or other signs of infection.
Chronic Charcot:
The chronic inactive stage no longer shows a warm and red foot. The edema usually persists. Crepitus, palpable loose bodies and large osteophytes are the result of extensive bone and cartilage destruction. Joint deformity, subluxation and dislocation of the metatarsals lead to a rocker-bottom type deformity in which the cuboid becomes a weight-bearing structure. This results in excessive skin callus formation, blisters and foot ulceration. At the stage of chronic inactive Charcot osteoarthropathy, bone healing and change of active periosteal reaction will proceed into inactive periosteal reaction and sclerotic borders. The classic radiographic description of neuro-osteoarthropathy is that of the five D' s. Debris may be present and effusions may decompress along fascial planes, carrying bony debris far from the joint. Dislocation is the result of ligamentous laxity. On the far left, a normal radiograph in the acute stage of Charcot. Subsequently progressive Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy is seen with dislocation of the Lisfranc joint.
Charcot with superimposed osteomyelitis:
To determine whether osteomyelitis in a Charcot foot at MR imaging is present, follow the path of an ulcer or sinus tract to the bone and evaluate the signal intensity of the bone marrow. If there is bone marrow edema, osteomyelitis is very likely. If there is bone marrow edema in the absence of a cutaneous defect, active Charcot may be present. If it is normal, both active Charcot as well as osteomyelitis is not likely. Charcot foot with rocker-bottom deformity and ulceration beneath the bony protuberance of the cuboid On the left a typical rocker-bottom deformity of the foot due to collapse of the longitudinal arch. Abnormal pressure on the cuboid has led to ulceration. STIR and T1W images in Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy with a plantar ulcer (asterix) and osteomyelitis of the cuboid. In a patient with Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy and a rocker-bottom foot, the cuboid bone is an important location of osteomyelitis. If the T1-weighted image at that location shows low signal intensity in combination with a cutaneous defect, osteomyelitis is extremely likely. On the left STIR and T1-weighted images of a patient with active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy with a plantar ulcer along the bony protuberance of the cuboid. There is abnormal signal intensity in the cuboid bone next to the ulcer, indicative of osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis in chronic Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy Here the contrast enhanced images with and without fat saturation. Enhancement of the cuboid bone and adjacent soft tissues on postcontrast images, together with the plantar ulcer, makes osteomyelitis very likely. No osteomyelitis in chronic Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy On the left a patient with Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy with a subcutaneous fistula tract (arrow). This patient has subcutaneous edema and swelling. When we follow the fistula tract to the bony protuberances of the cuboid, there is no marrow edema at the midfoot. This makes yet osteomyelitis unlikely. Ghost sign The ghost sign is indicative of neuro-osteoarthropathy with superimposed osteomyelitis. The "ghost sign" refers to poor definition of the margins of a bone on T1-weighted images, which become clear after contrast administration. Here, a patient with neuro-osteoarthropathy and superimposed osteomyelitis. The areas of osteomyelitis are more pronounced on the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image as compared to the native T1-weighted image. The bone marrow edema, which is of low signal intensity on the T1-weighted image without contrast enhances and becomes as bright as normal bone marrow.
MRI protocol:
The MRI examination includes special attention for positioning of the foot. It must be placed in the center of the magnet, to obtain homogeneous fat suppression. Markers have to be placed over ulcers or sinus tracts. T1 and STIR or T2 fatsat sequences are needed. Because of the curvature of the foot, fat suppression is more uniform with the use of STIR than with T2- weighted imaging with chemical fat saturation. However, STIR cannot be combined with contrast administration. As an alternative to spectral fat saturation technique, Dixon chemical shift imaging is described (8). Sagittal views are for evaluation of midfoot involvement, the plantar surface and the posterior calcaneus. A view parallel to the toes is adequate for imaging the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Contrast is used to better depict devitalized regions, abscesses, sinus tracts and joint or tendon involvement. by Andrea Donovan, MD and Mark E. Schweitzer, MD May 2010 RadioGraphics, 30, 723-736.

Meniscal pathology:
David Rubin and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA and the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2005-07-20 This article is based on a presentation by David Rubin and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Interactive cases are presented in the menu bar to test your knowledge. by David Rubin and Robin Smithuis
Normal Meniscal Anatomy:
Medial meniscus: The posterior horn is always larger than the anterior horn.
Medial meniscus:
Both horns are triangular in shape and have very sharp points. The posterior horn is always larger than the anterior horn (figure). If this is not the case, then the shape is abnormal, which can be a sign of a meniscal tear or a partial meniscectomy. LEFT: normal medial meniscal root immediately anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament. RIGHT: missing posterior root due to meniscal root tear. The posterior root is immediately anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament. If it is missing on the sagittal images, then there is a meniscal root tear (figure). The anterior horn has an insertion on the tibia and a second portion that travels from medial to lateral to connect to the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus (intermeniscal or transverse ligament). Lateral meniscus. Both horns are about the same size.
Lateral meniscus:
On sagittal images the posterior horn is higher in position than the anterior horn. Both horns are about the same size. Lateral meniscus: posterior horn and posterior meniscal root. The lateral meniscus posteriorly comes up high over the tibial spine to insert near the posterior cruciate ligament. This upward position of the posterior horn may be the reason for the higher signal intensity of the posterior horn in all planes due to magic angle effect.
Meniscal tears:

Criteria for tears:
The two most important criteria for meniscal tears are an abnormal shape of the meniscus and high signal intensity unequivocally contacting the surface on PD images. High signal intensity not unequivocally contacting surface. Small black line on inferior margin of the meniscus. At arthroscopy the meniscus was normal. It is a misunderstanding that menisci should be homogeneously low in signal intensity on proton-density images. The meniscus does not have to be black. Only when the high signal unequivocally reaches the surface of the meniscus you can make the diagnosis of a tear. If there is doubt whether the high signal touches the surface, look at all the adjacent images. If there is still doubt, then do not diagnose a tear. If you have a questionmark in your head, say "meniscus is normal". (figure) Basic shapes: Longitudinal, Horizontal and Radial.
Nomenclature of Meniscal Tears:
Shapes. There are 3 basic shapes of meniscal tears: longitudinal, horizontal and radial. Complex tears are a combination of these basic shapes. Bucket handle, Horizontal Flap tear and Parrot beak. Displaced Tears Bucket-handle tear = displaced longitudinal tear. Flap tear = displaced horizontal tear. Parrot beak = displaced radial tear.
Longitudinal, horizontal and radial tears:
Longitudinal tears Longitudinal tears parallel the long axis of the meniscus dividing the meniscus into an inner and outer part. Therefore, the distance between the tear and the outer margin of the meniscus is always the same (figure). The tear never touches the inner margin. Three sagittal images of a longitudinal tear Longitudinal tears follow the collagen bundles that parallel the contour of the meniscus. If a longitudinal tear has other components (horizontal or radial), then it is a complex tear violating the collagen bundles. This requires a higher energy trauma. LEFT: abnormal shape of posterior horn. A piece is missing. RIGHT: displaced fragment in the intercondylar fossa. Longitudinal tear (2) Bucket handle tear is a displaced longitudinal tear. LEFT: meniscus is abnormal in shape and there is a displaced fragment. RIGHT: Three structures in the intercondylar fossa: post cruciate lig (1), ant cruciate lig (2) and displaced fragment (3). On coronal images bucket handle tears are easier to recognize. Normally there are only two structures in the intercondylar fossa: the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament. Any other structure in the intercondylar fossa is abnormal and a displaced meniscal fragment is the most likely possibility. More on Bucket handle tears Flipped meniscus: posterior horn is missing because it is flipped over and located on top of the anterior horn. Longitudinal tear (3) Flipped meniscus is a form of bucket handle tear. There is a capsular detachment or peripheral tear of the meniscus, usually the posterior horn. The posterior horn flips over onto the anterior horn. More on Flipped meniscus Horizontal tear with a meniscal cyst Horizontal tears Horizontal tears divide the meniscus in a top and bottom part (pita bread). If horizontal tears go all the way from the apex to the outer margin of the meniscus, they may result in the formation of a meniscal cyst. The synovial fluid runs peripherally through the horizontal tear and accumulates within the meniscus and finally result in a cyst. The connection with the joint space is often lost, so they will not fill with contrast on MR-arthrography. The synovial fluid is absorbed and is replaced by a gelatinous substance. There are 3 criteria for the diagnosis of a meniscal cyst: The diagnosis of a meniscal cyst is important to the surgeon because it takes one operation on the outside of the knee to remove the cyst and another operation on the inside for the meniscus. Radial tears Radial tears are perpendicular to the long axis of the meniscus. They violate the collagen bundles that parallel the long axis of the meniscus. These are high energy tears. They start at the inner margin and go either partial or all the way through the meniscus dividing the meniscus into a front and a back piece. Radial tears are difficult to recognize. You have to combine the findings on sagittal and coronal images to make the diagnosis. LEFT: triangle missing the tip.RIGHT: disrupted bow tie. The following combination of findings is diagnostic: In one plane: triangle missing the tip and in the other plane: a disrupted bow tie. Disrupted bow tie indicating a small radial tear. Small radial tears are difficult to diagnose. Sometimes the only sign is a disrupted bow tie. LEFT: Absent or empty meniscus on sagittal image.RIGHT: Axial image shows complete radial tear leading to a defect in the meniscus. If you image a complete radial tear directly along the length of the tear you will see an absent or empty meniscus. These complete radial tears open up and give the impression that there is a part missing. However you will not find a displaced meniscal fragment. It is simply separation of the meniscal parts. More on empty meniscus sign Meniscal root tear: on sagittal images there is an absent or empty meniscus-sign adjacent to the posterior cruciate ligament where the meniscal root should be. On coronal images a meniscal root tear is confirmed.
Meniscal root tear:
A meniscal root tear is a radial tear located at the meniscal root. Normally when you image the posterior cruciate ligament on sagittal images you should see a considerable portion of the posterior horn of the meniscus on that image or the image adjacent to it. If this is not the case it is an absent or empty meniscus-sign, indicating a radial tear. More on meniscal root tears
Post-operative meniscus:
Post-operative menisci are harder to evaluate because the two most important criteria, i.e. abnormal signal and abnormal shape, do not apply. Abnormal signal is no longer a reliable sign of a tear, because if there has been a suture repair, this will heal with scar tissue, which also has high signal on PD-images (figure). Although an uncommon finding, if there is also high signal on T2-weighted images, then you can make the diagnosis of a tear, as this is the result of synovial fluid leaking into a meniscal tear. This however is an uncommon finding. Abnormal shape can be the result of partial meniscectomy. So you need to know what procedure was performed during arthroscopy. Only when comparison is made with prior postoperative images, can you determine, if an abnormal shape is a new finding indicative of a new tear. Sometimes differentiation between normal post-op findings and a re-tear is not possible on conventional MR-images. In these cases, MR-arthrography with 40cc diluted Gadolinium helps to make the distinction because even small amounts of Gadolinium that leak into a tear are readily visible on fat saturated T1 images. PD and T2W images. Prior partial meniscectomy and suture repair. At arthroscopy, there was no tear. Post-operative Meniscus 1 The case on the left shows a meniscus with an abnormal shape aswell as abnormal signal touching the surface on PD but not on T2W-images. This patient had a prior partial meniscectomy and a suture repair. On the basis of these imaging findings, it is impossible to tell if this is a tear or a normal postoperative finding. This patient had another operation for ACL reconstruction. The surgeon looked at the meniscus and the meniscus was found to be normal i.e. no tear. LEFT: Old MR exam with tear. Patient had a suture repair. RIGHT: On new exam, there is a new tear (yellow arrow). It is not possible to tell if the old tear has healed. Post-operative Meniscus 2 This patient had a suture repair for meniscal tear. There was a new injury. On the new MR, it is impossible to determine if the old tear had healed. However a new tear is seen, so this case is easy. MR-arthrogram: In the new tear the signal is as bright as in the synovial fluid (yellow arrows). In the healed tear the signal is not as bright. On an MR-arthrogram, there was very high signal intensity in the new tear comparable with the synovial fluid, but only moderate signal intensity at the healed old tear. So comparison with the old films was diagnostic for the new tear, while the arthrogram showed that the old tear has healed. PD and MR-arthrogram after suture repair for meniscal tear: healed tear. Post-operative Meniscus 3 This patient also had a suture repair for meniscal tear. After a new injury, the PD-images show high signal unequivocally reaching the surface of the meniscus (seen on the original films, but not clearly seen on the compressed image on the left). On this image, it is not possible to tell if the tear has healed. So an MR-arthrogram was performed which showed that the tear has healed.

Breast Implants:

Normal imaging findings and complications:
Esteban van Keulen, Saskia Fuchs, Maud Hegeman and Robin Smithuis
Department of Radiology of the Tergooi MC hospital in Hilversum, University Medical Center Utrecht and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2022-04-05 Breast augmentation surgery is the most popular cosmetic surgery procedure worldwide.
The number of women who have breast implants for augmentation or reconstruction is increasing. The risk of rupture increases with the age of the implant and is seen more often in reconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer than in implants for cosmetic augmentation. In this review we will focus on the role of imaging in describing normal and abnormal findings of common implants. This review is based on a presentation given by Saskia
Fuchs, Esteban van Keulen en Maud Hegeman during the Sandwich course of the Radiological Society of the Netherlands in
februari 2021.
Introduction:

Location and type of implant:
About 80% of breast implants are for cosmetic augmentation, while about 20% are for breast reconstruction following mastectomy.
Breast implants consist of a silicone outer envelope and a silicone or saline filling. Capsule
All breast implants will become encapsulated. This can start within weeks to years after implantation. 
It is a physiological foreign body reaction of fibrous tissue that will form around the implant. Breast implants are placed: Arros indicate the pectoral muscle Subpectoral implant
In this technique, the pectoralis major muscle is elevated from the chest wall.
Palpability
of the edges of the implant will be lower in general.
Mammograms are usually less distorted compared to the prepectoral group. Prepectoral implantIn the prepectoral technique, the implant is placed in front of the pectoral muscle posterior to the glandular tissue.
Rippling is observed as the most common complication.
Mammograms are somewhat more distorted. The location of the implant in relation to the pectoral muscle is best recognized on the oblique views. Saline filled implant and a silicone filled implant which is cut to show the form-stable content. Silicone filled implantsThe most used breast implants consists of an outer silicone elastomer envelope and an inner filling of silicone gel.
The silicone filling has evaluated over the years into a more form-stable mass (figure). Saline filled implantsSaline filled implants also have a silicone outer envelope. They
can be primarily used for cosmetic augmentation or
used
as breast tissue expanders in reconstructive surgery as a temporary device and gradually filled with saline. Saline filled implants are more prone to trauma
resulting in immediate deflation. Breast implants may be round or anatomically pre-shaped. 
The surface of the envelope can be smooth or textured including a polyurethane covering to prevent the implant from turning.
Some implants have a patch, which is a textured area on its surface to keep the implant in place or as a palpable orientation mark for the surgeon. * Must be considered as an uncertain finding if it is only seen as a single sign on a single image (which is uncommon).
Imaging findings:
This table summarizes normal and abnormal findings in breast implants. When the droplet-, noose- or keyhole sign is seen as a single sign on a single image, which is uncommon, then it must be considered as an uncertain finding. The Linguine sign is most specific for intracapsular rupture. Normal findings Capsular calcifications
Calcifications can be found in about 25% of the breast implants. The incidence of capsular calcifications increases with age of implants. These calcifications do not indicate rupture, although associated with some degeneration of the envelope. EffusionA
small amount of periprosthetic fluid is frequently seen and is almost always normal.
However
it still can be a seroma, hematoma or infection and must be correlated to
clinical symptoms. There is no absolute diameter that should be interpreted as
abnormal. Comparing
with the contralateral implant can be helpful. Folding
Palpable folds can occur especially in prepectoral implants with a superficial location in women with few surrounding tissue. These folds can be impressed and pop back at physical examination. Folding is a normal finding. Capsular calcifications. Possible intracapsular rupture of the breast implant on the right. On this axial CT-image there is
capsular thickening with severe capsular calcifications. On the right side there also is an irregular content and some
linear lines, which is suspicious for intracapsular rupture. Degenerative changes Capsular contraction The
incidence of contraction of the capsule is up to 25% in 10 years and is seen
more often in breast reconstruction than in cosmetic breast augmentation. The capsule
will become
thick and hardens, the
implant shape will usually become rounder and less compressible. Droplet sign
The droplet sign and inhomogeneous content are degenerative changes that may indicate intracapsular rupture, but are not definitive proof of rupture. Intracapsular rupture An intracapsular rupture occurs when the shell of the implant ruptures but the fibrous capsule formed by the breast remains intact. 
Silicone does not freely extravasate, but is stuck between the capsule and the envelope. 
This makes it difficult to detect on clinical exam or mammography. There are many signs described that indicate intracapsular rupture, but it all comes down to silicone between the capsule and the envelope.
Intracapsular rupture is best seen on MRI. Teardrop signIt is a focal invagination of the silicone envelope where the two walls do touch. A small amount of silicone is within the teardrop, which means that it is outside the envelope. Keyhole sign
Also known as nose-sign. It is a focal invagination of the silicone envelope where the two walls do not touch. A small amount of silicone is within the keyhole and outside the envelope. Linguine sign
The ruptured envelope appears as curvilinear lines that look like Linguine pasta. These signs of intracapsular rupture need to be differentiated from normal folding which may contain some fluid, which is normal periprosthetic fluid (figure). Extracapsular rupture In extracapsular rupture the silicone from the ruptured implant migrates freely beyond the envelope and the fibrous capsule into the surrounding breast tissue. Capsular calcifications and extracapsular rupture (arrow) In 2019 the mammogram shows extensive capsular calcifications and a very round shape of the breast implant.
This indicates a contracture of the implant. At follow up in 2020 the contour has changed and now there is silicone beyond the capsule, which is a definitive sign of extracapsular rupture (arrow). This elderly patient did not not want surgery, but only wanted screening for possible malignancy. In 2022 at follow up exam not much has changed. Modern Silicone gel is more cohesive and has less tendency to spread.
Reporting:
When you examine the patient with ultrasound, mention the degree of evaluability.
The condition of the implant can be obscured by capsular calcifications or the posterior border can be hard to see in big volume of implant. No Bi-Rads classification in the MRI report as the protocol is not able to
detect breastcancer.
Ultrasound:
Envelope (yellow arrow) and capsule (white arrow) anterior to the envelope
Normal findings:
Small effusions are commonly seen.
They have a different signal intensity than Silicone and should not be confused with the keyhole sign. The T2W-image shows an effusion
filling the virtual space between the envelope and the capsule. This is a
normal finding. The T1W-image shows a hypointens
thickened capsule. The capsule will show hypointense on any sequence. The contour of the implant is more
rounded, which indicates capsular contraction. Although signs of contraction can be well seen on
imaging, the degree of contraction is estimated by physical exanination. Normal radial folds Radial folds are infoldings of the envelope extending from the surface into the gel content. 
This is also a normal finding.
The content within the fold-lines should not contain Silicone. Normal radial folds More normal radial folds. Normal radial folds Here more examples of normal infolding of the envelope.
There is no silicone content within these folds. Normal radial folds Another example of
an extensive deep course of normal radial folds. Water droplet sign Multiple small round internal drops with fluid signal within the silicone gel can be a sign of degeneration. 
However there should be more signs to consider a possible rupture.
Folding:
Folds are seen in many forms. They are dynamic. 
When turning outwards they are sometimes palpable, especially at the edges of the breast implant and at locations where there is little tissue between the implant and the skin. These folds are normal findings. Radial folds Deep linear or curved lines within the implant can be hard to call. Are they inner radial folds or part of a collapsed envelope as a result of intracapsular rupture? Try to look for more signs and follow the line to look for continuity with the envelope. In some cases MRI is needed to solve this problem.
Intracapsular rupture:
When there is silicone within a fold, then it is a sign of intracapsular rupture. The images show: Here another example of the different presentations of intracapsular rupture with silicone outside the envelope, but within the capsule.
Stepladder sign:
US can detect intracapsular rupture by identifying a series of horizontal echogenic straight or curvilinear lines, somewhat parallel, traversing the interior of the implant, commonly known as the “stepladder sign”. It is important not to confuse the stepladder sign with normal prominent radial folds. Images
More examples of the “stepladder sign”. Stepladder sign in a patient with extreme capsular calcifications. In this patient heavily capsular calcifications did obscure the condition of the prosthesis. 
However when looking from a different angle it was obvious that there was a stepladder sign indicating rupture. Due to the widespread calcifications, it was not sure whether it was only an intracapsular rupture or also some extracapsular leakage of Silicone. Intracapsular rupture A. The envelope can no longer be found around the surface of the implant. The inner content is complete inhomogeneous and degenerated. B. The envelope is collapsed (yellow arrow) and does not follow the outer envelope-capsular complex (white arrow). 
There is an inhomogenous collection between the envelope and the capsule containing Silicone. .
Extracapsular rupture:
This woman has an extracapsular rupture on the right with silicone outside the thickened capsule (white arrow). In the left breast there is an intracapsular rupture indicated by the subcapsular line with silicone on both sides of the line (yellow arrow). Another example of extracapsular rupture with silicone outside the capsular border. Residual Silicone after explantation This patient had bilateral removal of the breast implants.
On the right there is high signal of silicone material in lymph nodes (white arrow). On the left there is residual silicone anterior and posterior to the major pectoralis muscle (yellow arrow) and also within the muscle. When a new silicone prosthesis is implanted, this residual silicone should not be interpreted as extracapsular leakage of the new implant.
MRI:

Protocol:
MRI is the gold standard for evaluation of the integrity of the breast implant with a sensitivity of 80-90% and specificity of 90-97% for detecting ruptures. It has a high spatial resolution and the ability to suppress or enhance the signal of Silicone, water and fat.
A combination of sequences can be used to detect complications. 
Gadolinium i.v. is not needed. T2W-images
These are best for studying the anatomy and provide high resolution. They also give information about lymph adenopathy. Silicone-only-imagesThese are STIR-images, in which fat is suppressed, combined with water suppression. As a result there is only signal of the silicone material. This sequence is ideal for studying rupture of the envelope and detecting silicone outside the envelope or outside the capsule. Water-only-imagesA combination of fat saturation and silicone suppression gives information about fluid collections within or around the prosthesis.
Linguine sign:
This is the most reliable sign of intracapsular rupture.
The curvilinear lines which are formed by the ruptured envelope resemble Linguine pasta. Enable Scroll

BIA-ALCL:

Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma:
BIA-ALCL
or breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma is an important complication
to
know of
silicon-filled and saline-filled breast implants. BIA-ALCL develops primarily if not exclusively in patients with textured implants.
The estimated prevalence in these implants is 1:30.000. 
Most BIA-ALCL were seen in Allergan Biocell textured breast implants and they were subsequently taken off the market. Two-thirds of individuals with
BIA-ALCL present with discomfort and swelling due to the development of
periprosthetic effusion (85%) in which atypical lymphoid cells are found. Sometimes associated with a mass in 15% of cases. Any late onset unilateral effusion or mass should be punctured and analyzed. Staging is with PET-CT, like in any other lymphoma. Most patients present with Stage 1.
The treatment is surgical excision of the implant, capsule and mass if present. Outcome is
favorable when early treated.
X-Ray and CT:
Chest X-Rays and CT do not play a role in examining breast implants. Sometimes they can be detected on X-rays for instance when there are capsular calcifications or when a  filling valve of an expandable prosthesis is seen (arrow). Also on CT sometimes complications can be seen, but usually CT does not give adequate information about the integrity of the prosthesis. Intracapsular rupture The chest film shows capsular calcifications in a medially displaced breast implant, which is not parallel to the breast contour. The CT of the same patient shows also calcifications at the posterior side not following the contour of the implant indicating intracapsular rupture (arrow). Saline filled prosthesis An intact implant has a homogeneous grey internal density on CT with a surrounding thin more hyperdens envelope and capsule. Location abnormalities and different types of fill valves can sometimes be seen. This patient has a saline filled prosthesis with a low internal density. 
A thin slightly hyperdens regular envelope is seen. Metallic valve On CT different types of fill valves of breast implants can be seen. Capsular calcifications are frequently seen and sometimes the Linguine sign (arrow). In most cases the findings on CT will be inconclusive. The left implant in this patient shows capsular calcifications, which are not located at the periphery and which are discontinuous. Unclear whether this is an extracapsular rupture or whether there is a large effusion.
Mammography:
Same patient before and after prepectoral breast augmentation. 
Especially prepectoral implants can reduce mammographic assessment. Still
mammography and 3D tomosynthesis can be well performed and in fact has the highest
PPV for recognition of extra capsular silicone. 
It also objectively detects changes
in time, shows calcifications, can show surrounding fluid shadow and of course adds
important findings in fibroglandular tissue.
Eklund technique:
Special views can be performed such as the Eklund views. 
By pushing the implant posteriorly and pulling the breast tissue anteriorly better visualization of the fibroglandular tissue can be achieved.
Tomosynthesis:
Tomosynthesis can be very useful as in this case.
There is a mass on the lateral side, which is best seen on the  3D tomographic image. 
Ultrasound guided biopsy was performed and this mass proved to be a fibroadenoma. On this mammogram there were both capsular calcifications and atypical extracapsular calcifications. Detail of the specimen showing mass and grouped calcifications. Pathology: breast cancer grade 2, no special type (NST). This woman has a saline filled implant and shows a discoid diaphragm, which is the fill valve.
There is a mass, which is more obvious on the tomosynthesis (image 56 out of 73). It is a spiculated mass. 
Pathology: infiltrating lobular carcinoma grade 2 and LCIS. Another example of the value of tomosynthesis. The tumor is best seen on the tomographic view.
Complications of implants:
The oblique view of the right breast shows a deflated ruptured  Saline filled implant. A normal saline filled implant with filling valve on the left. In A there are prepectoral capsular calcifications of a previous inplant and a subpectoral prosthesis. In B there is a situation after operative capsulectomy and replacing of the subpectoral breast implant. Silicone leakage Typical appearance of silicone outside of the capsule presenting as dense well deliniated masses outside the contour of the breast implant. Silicone granulomas
Silicone granulomas:
Silicone granulomas remainig after removal of breast implant because of previous extracapsular rupture in 2013. Silicone granulomas can manifest as masses with suspicious morphology and enhancement dynamics on breast MRI or with increased FDG uptake on PET CT.
They
can present at the periphery of the prosthesis or in breast tissue after
rupture. The presence of silicone implants and awareness of the possibility of a rupture and formation of silicone granulomas may help in facilitating a correct diagnosis (ref). Free silicone breast injections
Free silicone breast injections:
This is an alternative form of breast augmentation, although it has serious adverse effects and is banned in many countries. This patient from the Philipines presents with bilateral painful lumps in the breasts. The massive densities in both breasts are the result of silicone intraglandular injections. Continue with the MR... MRI of the same patient showing free silicone as areas of high signal on silicone-only sequence.

Sella Turcica and Parasellar Region:
Walter Kucharczyk and Marieke Hazewinkel
Radiology department of the University of Toronto, Canada and the Radiology department the Medical Centre Alkmaar, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2008-08-10 This review is based on a presentation given by Walter Kucharczyka and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Marieke Hazewinkel. In this review a systematic anatomic approach to differential diagnosis of a sellar or parasellar mass is described. By clicking on one of the subjects in the list on the left, you will go directly to this item. If you have printing problems with the margins of the document, you may have to adjust the margins in the page set up of your internet browser, which you will find in the top left of the menu bar.
Anatomic Approach to Differential Diagnosis:
In order to analyze a sellar or parasellar mass on MRI we use the following anatomic approach: Pituitary gland On a coronal section through the brain the reference structure is the pituitary gland which lies in the sella turcica. It is usually larger in females than in males - in females the superior border tends to be convex, whereas in males it is usually concave. The most common abnormalities that arise in the pituitary gland are pituitary adenoma, Rathke's cleft cyst and craniopharyngioma. Pituitary stalk The next structure to identify is the pituitary stalk. This is a vertically oriented structure which connects the pituitary gland to the brain. It is thinner at the bottom and thicker at the top. Embryologically, it is also derived from Rathke's cleft epithelium and therefore the pathologies, which can arise in the pituitary gland can also arise in the stalk. There are a few unusual things to be considered in children, such as germinomas and eosinophilic granulomas. In adults metastases and occasionally lymphoma can arise in the pituitary stalk. Optic chiasm Another major structure in the suprasellar cistern is the optic chiasm. It is an extension of the brain and looks like the number 8 lying on its side. It is glial tissue - therefore the most common tumors to originate here are gliomas. In the US and Europe another frequent pathology in this region is demyelinating disease - particularly multiple sclerosis. This can also be associated with some swelling of the optic chiasm. Hypothalamus Further cephalad lies the base of the brain, which at this location is the hypothalamus. Anatomically the hypothalamus forms the lateral walls and floor of the third ventricle. The most common pathologies to arise here are gliomas - in children hamartomas, germinomas and eosinophilic granuloma. Carotid artery A very important structure in this area is the internal carotid artery. It runs a complex anatomic course as it passes through the skull base shaped like an S on lateral views. It passes through the cavernous sinus. The segment cranial to this is known as the supracavernous segment. This bifurcates into the anterior cerebral artery, which passes cranially to the optic chiasm, and the middle cerebral artery, which runs laterally. Aneurysms and ectasias are pathologies that can arise here. One must also be aware of congenital variations in the course of the internal carotid Sometimes it is very medially positioned and can actually lie in the midline. Cavernous sinus The cavernous sinus is a paired complex of venous channels. In the lateral wall of the sinus run nerve III (oculomotorius), IV (trochlearis), V1 and V2 (trigeminus). The sixth cranial nerve (abducens) runs more medially and is located caudal to the carotid artery. The most common pathologies occurring in the cavernous sinus include schwannomas arising from the cranial nerves and inflammation, which can lead to thrombosis. This is known as cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis. Carotid-cavernous fistulas are fistulous communications between the carotid artery and the veins of the cavernous sinus. Meninges The meninges cover the cavernous sinus. They are thicker laterally and superiorly than medially and inferiorly. The most common tumor to arise from the meninges is of course the meningioma. Dural metastasis is the second most common tumor to arise here. Also inflammatory pathologies occur in the basal meninges - the most common infection being tuberculous meningitis. Of the non-infectious inflammatory pathologies sarcoidosis is the commonest. Sphenoid sinus Inferior to the pituitary gland lies the sphenoid sinus. This structure contains air and is lined by mucosa and bone. Posterior to the sphenoid sinus lies the clivus (not shown on this coronal section through the brain). Pathology that arises in this area includes carcinomas arising from the mucosa of the sphenoid sinus - squamous cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are the most common. Chordomas arise in the clivus and chondrosarcomas and osteosarcomas also occur in this area. Metastases can occur anywhere. Bacterial or fungal inflammatory processes in the sphenoid sinus can spread intracranially via the cavernous sinus.
Pituitary Microadenoma:
Pituitary Microadenoma By definition, pituitary microadenomas are less than 10 mm in diameter and are located in the pituitary gland. These images show a classic case: on T1 a lesion about 3-4 mm in diameter, slightly hypointense compared to normal pituitary tissue, located in the pituitary gland. On T2, the lesion is slightly hyperintense. The differential diagnosis: pituitary microadenoma or Rathke's cleft cyst (the two can be indistinguishable). The sensitivity of an unenhanced MRI scan for detecting pituitary microadenomas is about 70%. It is not always necessary to give intravenous contrast for detecting pituitary microadenomas as patients with a negative scan generally receive the same symptomatic treatment as patients with a microadenoma (usually these patients are women with symptoms of hyperprolactinemia). The purpose of the scan is to rule out any large lesions. In possible surgical candidates (for example patients with failed medical therapy or pituitary disease not amenable to medical therapy such as Cushing's disease) it is necessary to give contrast to localize the lesion as accurately as possible. On an unenhanced scan, approximately 70% of all pituitary microadenomas can be detected. If you give gadolinium, you can reduce the false-negative rate from 30% to 15%. As mentioned earlier, this usually does not affect patient management. Coronal T1 and T2-weighted images and T1-weighted images before and after gadolinium. In this patient the lesion in the pituitary gland is only detectable after the administration of intravenous contrast. The differential diagnosis: pituitary microadenoma or Rathke's cleft cyst.
Pituitary Macroadenoma:
By definition, pituitary macroadenomas are adenomas over 10mm in size. They tend to be soft, solid lesions, often with areas of necrosis or hemorrhage as they get bigger. As they grow, they first expand the sella turcica and then grow upwards. In this example of a pituitary macroadenoma there is suprasellar extension with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. Because they are soft tumors, they usually indent at the diaphragma sellae, giving them a 'snowman' configuration. This is one feature that can help distinguish between a pituitary macroadenoma and a meningioma. Another feature which can help differentiate them is enlargement of the sella turcica - this generally only occurs with pituitary macroadenomas that originate in the sella. On the left another example of a pituitary macroadenoma. The lesion starts in the sella, which is enlarged, and extends into the suprasellar cistern. Note the classic 'snowman' configuration caused by constriction by the diaphragma sellae. Notice the blood-fluid level, indicating hemorrhage. The usefulness of observing the inclination of the diaphragmatic leaflets was referred to earlier. On the T2-weighted images on the right you can see that the leaflets are displaced upwards by this macroadenoma which started in the sella and is growing upwards. A lesion originating above the sella and growing downwards would push the leaflets in the other direction (this can be seen with meningiomas for example). Usually the diagnosis of a macroadenoma is straightforward. Sometimes a meningioma can give a similar appearance. On the left an example of a meningioma. Note there is no diaphragmatic constriction and there is uniform enhancement after the administration of intravenous gadolinium which is typical of meningioma. These images are of a transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary macroadenoma. After the bony floor of the sella turcica has been removed, the dura is incised with a cruciate incision. Because the pressure above the dura is larger than the pressure below, the macroadenoma then delivers itself into the sphenoid sinus. Intra-operative MRI was performed in an experimental setting to determine whether the neurosurgeon had successfully removed all of the tumor. Because using this surgical approach means a limited field-of-view, it is important to know beforehand what it is you are operating on. As we will see there are lesions you do not want to operate using this approach! Another common pathway of extension is laterally into the cavernous sinus. It is not always possible to tell if there is cavernous sinus invasion, but there are three signs to look out for:
-Is there more than 50% encirclement of the carotid artery? Note: meningiomas tend to constrict the carotid artery, macroadenomas do not.
-Is there lateral displacement of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus compared to the opposite side?
-Is there an increased amount of tissue interposed between the carotid artery and the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus? At medical school they teach you that a rare manifestation of a common lesion is more likely than a rare abnormality. Since pituitary adenomas are the most common lesions of the skull base, it is prudent to always include them in the differential diagnosis if you can not identify a normal pituitary gland when confronted with a mass in this region. This patient presented with nasal obstruction. She went to an ENT specialist who saw a large endonasal mass and she was referred to the neurosurgeon for planned major skull base resection. The neurosurgeon had seen something similar before, and checked her prolactin-level. This was 4000 (25 or less is normal). Endonasal biopsy revealed prolactinoma. After treatment with bromocriptine the mass shrunk down and no surgery was necessary.
Rathke Cleft Cyst:
Rathke's cleft cyst is the second of three pathologies derived from Rathke's cleft epithelium. The cyst is fluid-filled and has very thin walls with a thickness of only one or two cell layers. This is illustrated by the microscopic image. These walls can contain cells which secrete fluid, allowing the cyst to grow and compress adjacent structures. Rathke's cleft cysts can occur either in or above the sella turcica. On the images above there is a normal pituitary gland, a normal optic chiasm and a normal carotid artery on each side. The pituitary stalk is not identifiable, however, due to a round mass in this area. The mass has a high signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-images. Now the only two things that are this bright on unenhanced T1-weighted images are either fluid (blood or proteinacious fluid) or fat. Solid masses are not this bright. Therefore it is most likely a cystic structure originating from the pituitary stalk, probably a Rathke's cleft cyst. A cystic craniopharyngioma is also in the differential diagnosis.
These images illustrate the importance of unenhanced T1 images. They allow you to appreciate that the abnormality is located in the pituitary stalk alone. If you were only presented with images after the administration of intravenous contrast, you might think the pituitary gland was abnormal as well. These T1, T2 and T1-weighted images after gadolinium demonstrate another Rathke's cleft cyst located in the pituitary gland. Unlike the normal pituitary tissue and pituitary stalk it does not enhance after the administration of intravenous contrast. The normal pituitary tissue is compressed and displaced far to the left. It is important to recognize this as it could be mistaken for an enhancing component of the cystic mass. In general, all extra-axial masses , i.e. masses outside of the brain like the pituitary gland and stalk, will enhance because they do not have a blood-brain barrier. If you have a non-enhancing extra-axial mass, there are three possibilities:
Craniopharyngioma:
Craniopharyngioma is the third of the three pathologies derived from Rathke's cleft epithelium. Technically these are benign tumors, but unlike Rathke's cleft cysts, they have thick walls and are locally invasive. Macroscopically, it is a complex mass with multiple nodules at the base of the brain, sinuating along the fissures. Often, it can not be completely resected. The picture on the right shows a thick-walled cyst as part of the craniopharyngioma. In over 50% of cases craniopharyngiomas have a pathognomonic appearance. On these unenhanced and enhanced T1-weighted sagittal images, a compressed pituitary gland can be identified. There is a large intrasellar and suprasellar mass with cystic and enhancing components as well as calcifications. These findings in a child are virtually pathognomonic for craniopharyngioma (perhaps with only a dermoid in the differential diagnosis). Coronal images of the same mass. And axial images. Unenhanced CT shows the calcifications more clearly. After intravenous contrast the total extent of the lesion and its cystic components are much less evident.
Meningioma:
The most common intracranial tumor in adults is the meningioma with 20% of occurring at the skull base. This is an autopsy specimen with the brain removed, showing a meningioma sitting on the diaphragma sellae. Meningiomas are almost always solid lesions, sometimes with a cyst on the edge. They can lift up the arachnoid a little bit and enhance uniformly as a general rule. On the top-left unenhanced and enhanced CT-images, the main differential diagnosis of the enhancing mass would include meningioma, pituitary adenoma and an aneurysm. The post-constrast MR-image on the top-right rules out an aneurysm as a possible diagnosis (no flow void), but on axial images a pituitary adenoma and meningioma are still difficult to differentiate. Notice the spread of the lesion along the meninges. The epicentre of the lesion is above the sella. Meningioma. T1WI and T1WI-postcontrast On the coronal images (T1 and T1-postcontrast), a compressed pituitary gland can be identified at the bottom of the sella turcica. Above it lies a large mass, partially intrasellar and partially suprasellar. Although the diaphragma sellae can not be identified on these images, it is probably a suprasellar mass growing downwards. When pituitary macroadenomas get this size they usually have areas of hemorrhage or necrosis - in mengiomas this is less often the case.
Aneurysm:
This is an important case to keep in mind. This patient is a woman in her late forties, who presented to her family doctor with galactorrhea. The family doctor did a number of tests, including a determination of her prolactin level. This was about 150 (25 or less is normal). Thinking the patient had a pituitary adenoma, the family doctor ordered this CT scan. It is easy to get tunnel vision when reporting on a scan like this as a radiologist when the clinical information includes hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea. Of course your first thought is a pituitary adenoma. If you look at the location of the lesion however (partially in the sella turcica and partially in the cavernous sinus), there are other possibilities, including a meningioma or an aneurysm. The radiologist reported this as a pituitary adenoma, and the patient was treated with bromocriptine. The bromocriptine had no effect, and the patient went to a neurosurgeon for a surgical opinion. The neurosurgeon ordered this MRI. The lesion partly in the right cavernous sinus and partly in the sella turcica is predominantly black on this T1-weighted image. In general there are three things that are black on MRI: air, bone and rapid blood flow. In this case it is black due to rapid blood flow in a carotid aneurysm. This is the corresponding angiogram. Obviously, this is not a lesion to be operated on transsphenoidally! Hypothalamus hormones either stimulate (green arrow) or inhibit (red arrow) the production of pituitary hormones. Why did the aneurysm cause hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea in this patient? It was caused by compression of the pituitary stalk. The pituitary stalk connects the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland and hormones produced in the hypothalamus are transported to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland via portal veins running along the stalk. Most of these hormones stimulate the production of other hormones in the pituitary gland (such as TRH, GnRH, GHRH and CRH), but the release of dopamine inhibits the production of prolactin by the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Therefore when the stalk is compressed by a mass or is transected, the level of prolactin rises while all the other hormone levels decrease. This is known as the 'Stalk Section Effect'.
It is the reason why masses other than adenomas can cause hyperprolactinemia. This is also why an unenhanced MRI scan suffices in a patient with hyperprolactinemia: it is not the size of the microadenoma, but ruling out other pathology that matters. On the left the T1-weighted image of a thrombosed aneurysm with high signal intensity on the unenhanced scan. It originates in the intracavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery.
On the right the T2-weighted images: the thrombosed aneurysm has a dark rim. This is an example of a partially thrombosed aneurysm in the suprasellar cistern. The patent lumen is black on these T1-weighted images. It is surrounded by clot of different ages arranged in layers reaching from the lumen to the wall. It resembles an onion cut in half. On the left an autopsy specimen. You can see that this patient suffered a massive intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The layers of bloodclot are very nicely reflected in the MR images.
Aneurysm vs Meningioma:
One of the most difficult differential diagnoses on CT is aneurysm versus meningioma. In this patient there is a large mass on the right hand side, possibly originating from the meninges or cavernous sinus. On CT it is impossible to tell whether this mass is an aneurysm or a meningioma. This is an MRI of the same patient. The mass is predominantly black and there is a large flow artefact running in the phase-encoding direction. These findings correspond to rapid blood flow, and the mass must therefore be an aneurysm. Angiogram of the same patient. It demonstrates that the flow in the aneurysm is not laminar, but that it swirls, gradually filling the lumen with contrast.
Hamartoma:
Hamartomas are masses of dysplastic tissue found almost exclusively in young children. One of the most common locations is the floor of the third ventricle. This is a pathology specimen showing a small nodule hanging in the suprasellar cistern. They are benign lesions, but patients do succumb to them because of the bad location. These are CT images of a hamartoma suspended from the floor of the third ventricle. It does not enhance after the administration of intravenous contrast. MR images of a similar small nodule suspended from the floor of the third ventricle. Hamartoma (red arrow) posterior to the enhancing pituitary gland and stalk. The best images to see hamartomas on are enhanced sagittal T1-weighted MR images. Here you can see the non-enhancing hamartoma attached to the tuber cinereum between the pituitary stalk and mamillary body. There really is no differential diagnosis.
Hypothalamic and Chiasm Glioma:
Optic nerve glioma in a patient with neurofibromatosis Gliomas can occur in any part of the brain and the optic chiasm is a common location, particularly in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. This enhanced CT shows an example of an optic nerve glioma in a patient with neurofibromatosis. There is a suprasellar mass which is indistinguishable from the optic chiasm. Further forward at the level of the orbits the optic nerve is abnormal on both sides. These consecutive coronal MR-images show the mass at the optic chiasm and the swollen optic nerves. On these axial images you can see the optic nerves and chiasm enhance after the administration of intravenous gadolinium. The way a patient is normally positioned, slices through the nerves themselves are not obtained. These slices can be used to make oblique images along the axis of the nerves. With these images as a result. Note the enhancement of the nerve after intravenous contrast with sparing of the meninges. Approximately 25% of optic nerve gliomas do not enhance, so a lack of enhancement should not prevent you from making the diagnosis. This is another example of a right-sided optic nerve glioma with enhancement after gadolinium. Note the normal pituitary gland and stalk.
Germinoma:
Germinoma (Courtesy of Dr. Susan Blaser) The following case concerns a 9-year-old male with a history of headache, nausea and vomiting. Sagittal T1 images before and after intravenous contrast show a mass in the midline, on the floor of the third ventricle. The mass enhances after gadolinium. Continue with next images. T2- and T1 weighted sagittal images of the same patient show a similar mass in the epiphysial area. This is a germinoma - an intracranial germ cell tumor that occurs primarily in children and adolescents. These are typical localisations. These lesions crawl along the floor of the 3rd ventricle.
Chordoma:
Chordomas are the most common lesions of the clivus, also a favored location for metastases and chondrosarcomas. This patient has a normal pituitary gland. Posterior to this is a large, fungating mass positioned at the level of the clivus. The CT shows some calcifications in this area. The differential diagnosis for this mass would be chordoma or chondrosarcoma. Chordomas tend to occur in the midline, whereas chondrosarcomas tend to occur off the midline.
Metastases:
The patient on the left is a patient with lung cancer who presented with a sixth cranial nerve palsy. The abnormality is in the clivus, which should have a high signal intensity on this sagittal T1-weighted image (as in the image on the left). A low signal intensity means the normal fatty marrow has been replaced by some other tissue. In this case by tumor metastasis. Also lymphomas, myelomas or diffuse bone abnormalities can give this appearance. Therefore always take a minute to look at the clivus. So again in order to analyse a sellar or parasellar mass on MRI we use the following anatomic approach:
CT-pattern of Bowel wall thickening:
Richard Gore and Robin Smithuis
Professor of Radiology, University of Chicago, Evanston, IL, USA and the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2014-05-21 This article is based on a presentation given by Richad Gore and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Richard Gore is editor of the Textbook of Gastrointestinal Radiology, 3rd Edition and High Yield Imaging: Gastrointestinal. We will discuss a pattern approach to patients with bowel wall thickening with special attention to the CT-enhancement patterns.
Introduction:
Bowel wall thickening is a common finding in imaging. CT can be helpful in the differentiation of intestinal disease. Important features to look for are: All these features will be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.
Lenght of bowel wall involvement:
Adenocarcinoma usually presents as a short segment of bowel wall thickening. The borders are shouldering unlike in diverticulitis, where the borders are tapering (figure).
* 5-10 cm involvement Diverticulitis, Crohn's disease and ischemia usually present as a somewhat longer segment of involvement.
* 10-30 cm involvement See the list in the table. The image shows a submucosal hemorrhage. This is mostly seen in the small bowel and duodenum.
* Diffuse involvement When the entire colon is involved think of ulcerative colitis. Involvement of both the colon and the small bowel is seen in infectious bowel disease (IBD), edema and SLE.
Overview of enhancement pattern:
The figure shows an overview of the CT-patterns of mural enhancement in patients with bowel wall thickening. Click to enlarge.
Type 1 - White Attenuation:
There are many pathophysiologic events that can cause a white attenuation pattern: Normal bowel wall enhancement. The normal bowel will enhance bright especially if the scan is in the late arterial phase, i.e. 35-40 seconds post injection. If the bowel wall is not thickened, this is normal enhancement. When there is bright enhancement in thickened bowel, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the white enhancement pattern and the water-target-sign pattern. Acute inflammatory bowel disease.
Acute IBD:
Here a patient with acute inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Notice the bright enhancement of a large segment of the small bowel with a thickened wall. This is the result of hyperemia due to the vasodilatation. Notice the dilated vessels on the ventral side. Shock bowel with hyperenhancement. Slit-like IVC (red arrow).
Shock Bowel:
In patients with a hypovolemic shock, there is a redistribution of the blood flow. This can result in abnormal bright enhancement of the bowel wall like in this case of a patient who is in a hemorrhagic shock. Notice that some bowel loops show a white pattern, while others show a water target sign. The slit-like inferior vena cava is due to the hypovolemia (red arrow). Hyperenhancing adrenal glands in shock. As a result of redistribution of bloodflow to vital organs, these patients can have hyperenhancing adrenal glands, as these organs are needed to produce adrenaline in order to manage the shock.
Type 2 - Gray Attenuation:
In the gray-pattern, the bowel wall is thick and despite a nice bolus of contrast there is poor enhancement and you can not see the different layers of the bowel wall. This pattern is seen in chronic fibrotic Crohn's disease, ischemia and neoplasms like adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. Gray enhancement pattern in a patient with chronic Crohn's disease.
Chronic Crohn's disease:
Here a patient with chronic Crohn's disease with cicatrization. In these patients the bowel wall is like a rock and these patients will not respond to steroids or other medication.
Mesenteric Ischemia:
Bowel ischemia frequently affects the colon and is more frequently seen in the splenic flexure, descending colon and sigmoid. It is mostly due to a low flow state like hypovolemic shock or congestive heart failure. Especially in elderly with bowel wall thickening you should always put ischemia in your differential diagnostic list. A special cause of ischemia in the small bowel is a closed loop obstruction, which we will discuss in a moment. Gray enhancement pattern in a patient with SMV thrombosis. Here a patient with bowel ischemia as a result of thrombosis in the SMV (red arrow). Notice the venous congestion in the mesentery (yellow arrow). Gray enhancement pattern in a patient with closed loop obstruction. Here another patient with ischemia of a large segment of the small bowel due to a closed loop obstruction. An important appearance of a closed loop obstruction is that of a radial array of dilated small bowel loops with the mesenteric vessels converging to a central point. The findings of ischemia in closed loop obstruction are the same as in patients with other causes of mesenteric ischemia: Click here for more information about closed loop obstruction. Sometimes it can be helpful to determine the amount of enhancement on thick slab coronal reconstructions. This is nicely demonstrated in this patient, where there is good enhancement of the jejunum (green area), but lack of enhancement in the ileum (red area) as a result of ischemia. Here another case of closed loop obstruction. Notice the difference in enhancement between the normal non-distended loops (green arrow) and the distended strangulated loops (red arrow). In the center are the twisted mesenteric vessels (yellow arrow).
Tumor:
The gray enhancement pattern with loss of identification of the various layers of the bowel wall can be seen in various tumors like adenocarcinoma, metastases and GIST. Lymphoma and neuroendocrine tumors like carcinoid usually show somewhat more enhancement. Here a patient with an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid.
Type 3 - Water target sign:
The most common type of enhancement is the target sign with water density. Target sign with submucosal edema. The target sign is caused by the enhancing mucosa and muscularis propria with the edematous submucosa in between (figure). Pseudomembranous Colitis with dilatation of the sigmoid.
Pseudomembranous Colitis:
Pseudomembranous colitis (PMC or sometimes called colitis difficile) is a colitis, that is mostly caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile due to bacterial overgrowth of the colon in patients who are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Here a patient with PMC. There is ascites and hyper enhancement of the bowel wall with submucosal edema and edema in the mesocolon. The dilated bowel in the right lower abdomen is actually the redundant sigmoid. Pseudomembranous Colitis The diagnosis is made by testing for the presence of C. difficile toxins in the stool or the presence of C. difficile itself. The endoscopic detection of pseudomembranes on the mucosa of the colon or rectum used to be diagnostic of PMC before the above tests and CT were available. Risk factors for developing PMC are: Pseudomembranous colitis Patients present with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever caused by the toxins that are produced by the bacteria. The disease can be complicated by a toxic megacolon. Pseudomembranous colitis The CT findings are:
Portal hypertension:
Portal hypertension is another cause of the water target sign. When a patient has portal hypertension, the increased pressure is transmitted to the right colon. This leads to the generation of inflammatory mediators and increased production of nitrous oxide, which induces tissue injury. This produces an isolated right sided colitis. Study the images and then continue reading. The findings are: The differential diagnosis is: Right -sided colitis in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The endoscopic images are of different patient with right-sided colitis.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:
Patients with portal hypertension and right-sided colitis are at risk for developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In these patients there is vascular ectasia in the right colon. A diffuse colitis can be seen with granular, erythematous and mucosal friability, which just looks like ulcerating colitis. The following items make these patients at risk for developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Typhlitis in a patient with neutropenia.
Typhlitis:
Typhlitis is another disease that presents with the water target sign. Typhlitis is a necrotizing inflammation of the cecum, which is usually seen in patients with neutropenia due to acute leukemia, AIDS or aplastic anemia. There is transmural edema and ulceration, which can cause perforation. The micro-organisms that are involved are: Pseudomonas, Candida, CMV and E. Coli. These patients are very sick and have fever, watery-bloody diarrhea and neutropenia. Neutropenia is an abnormally low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight off infections, particularly those caused by bacteria and fungi. When the neutropenia is severe - fewer than about 500 cells per microliter of blood - bacteria, that normally present in the mouth and digestive tract can cause infections. CMV-colitis.
Infectious Colitis:
Right colon: Diffuse colitis Left colon and Rectosigmoid: Rectosigmoid:
Ischemia:
In young patients ischemia is usually due to trauma or vasculitis. Here are images of a young patient with SLE. There is a gray-pattern of enhancement of the whole left-sided colon.
Type 4 - Fat target sign:
Submucosal fat was first reported in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Soon it turned out that submucosal fat was frequently seen in obese patients, especially in the transverse and descending colon. Now the most common cause of the fat target sign is obesity. Rapid submucosal fat accumulation can be seen in patients that are treated with chemotherapy. Here a patient with Crohn's disease and a fat-target sign. 17% of patients with Crohn's disease have submucosal fat in the terminal ileum and ascending colon. It is dependent on the duration of the disease. Submucosal fat is frequently seen in patients with celiac disease. Especially if there is isolated fat in the duodenum or in the proximal jejunum, that is very suspicious of celiac disease. These patients also have more pronounced folds in the ileum compared to the jejunum, which is the opposite of the normal finding (figure). The faeces in these patients may contain more fat (blue arrow). How to deal with submucosal fat?
Type 5 - Gas - Pneumatosis:
The most concerning pattern is gas within the bowel wall. Gas within the bowel wall is called pneumatosis intestinalis. Pneumatosis intestinalis is seen in life-treatening situations in patients with ischemia and impending bowel perforation, who need immediate therapy. However pneumatosis can also be found as an incidental finding in patients without abdominal complaints. Finally gas adjacent to the bowel wall can mimick pneumatosis. This is called pseudopneumatosis. So the first question is....are we really dealing with pneumatosis intestinalis and what is the clinical setting of the patient. The clinical course is generally benign when pneumatosis is an incidental finding, such as when it occurs in association with obstructive pulmonary disease.
Pseudopneumatosis:
Let's first start with pseudopneumatosis, because we don't want to alarm anybody by mistaking normal intraluminal gas for pneumatosis. Especially in the cecum and ascending colonic gas bubbles can be trapped between fecal debris and the mucosa. In this case we are quite sure that the gas is intraluminal and not within the wall. In this case it is more difficult. The linear arrangement of the gas bubbles makes it suspective of pneumatosis. However these gas bubbles are trapped between the fecal debris and the bowel wall. In these cases you have to carefully study all the images and use different window settings. Give special attention to the non-dependent bowel wall, where there is no feces in contact with the mucosa and gas bubbles will not be seen. Pseudopneumatosis in SBO. String of pearls signThis is a patient with a small bowel obstruction (SBO). Study the images. Then continue reading. The CT-images show dilatation of the small bowel. In these patients the folds of the small bowel or valvulae conniventes will widen and air bubbles will become trapped in a stepladder configuration on the ventral side. On a horizontal beam radiograph of the abdomen this is known as the string of pearls sign. Here another case of SBO with a string of pearls sign. Enable Scroll

At first glance this really looks like pneumatosis in a patient with a very dilated ascending colon due to an obstructing tumor. Notice how gas bubbles can be seen in a circular arrangement and are also seen on the non-dependent portion of the bowel wall (blue arrow). However when we scroll through the images, it becomes clear that these gas bubbles are only seen in between the bowel wall and the bowel content. When we get to the point, where there is a air-fluid level, there are no air bubbles on the non-dependent portion of the bowel wall. So this is another case of pseudopneumatosis. However this still is a very sick bowel and decompression is needed. Such an accumulation of gas bubbles between the mucosa and the bowel content is only possible in a bowel, that has lost its normal peristaltic movements due to longstanding and severe obstruction.
Portal venous gas:
Now let's continue with some patients, who do have pneumatosis. Here a patient in whom there is no doubt about the diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis. Identifying gas within the mesenteric or portal veins is diagnostic of pneumatosis. These patients are not only at risk for bowel ischemia and perforation, but also for sepsis. Portal venous gas is an ominous radiologic sign and is associated with a high mortality rate. The increased use of CT has resulted in the recognition of an increasing number of non-life threatenig causes of portal venous gas of which diverticulitis is the most common. Here a patient with extensive pneumatosis and gas within the portal veins. Bowel ischemia was found at surgery. Pneumobilia: air in the intrahepatic bile ducts and in the common bile duct (arrow). Gas in the portal veins has to be differentiated from gas within the bile ducts, which is called pneumobilia. Sometimes an air-fluid level can be seen in the portal vein. Portal venous gas is located peripherally in the liver as opposed to pneumobilia which is usually more centrally located. In this case it is obvious that the air is located within the bile ducts. There is air centrally in the liver and we also see air in the common bile duct (arrow). Obstruction is a common cause of pneumatosis. Here a patient with pneumatosis of the cecum and ascending colon as a result of obstruction due to a sigmoid cancer (arrow). The gas in the bowel wall indicates an impending perforation. Here another patient with pneumatosis as result of an obstruction. Post decompression the wall of the cecum returned to normal.
Pneumatosis due to trauma:
Trauma is a well-known cause of pneumatosis. Laceration of the mucosa due to anastomotic surgery or catheter manupilation may result in entrance of gas into the submucosal layer. In this patient the insertion of a feeding catheter resulted in pneumatosis of the small bowel. Pneumatosis after insertion of a PEG-tube. Here a patient with pneumatosis intestinalis after a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). This is a procedure in which a PEG tube is passed into the stomach through the abdominal wall to provide a means of feeding when oral intake is not adequate. Notice the following: Enable Scroll

This patient was septic and based on the ultrasound findings the diagnosis of an abscess post-cholecystectomy was made. A CT was performed to prepare for a CT-guided percutaneous drainage of the abscess (red circle). Scroll through the images. Then continue reading. On the first image there is gas in the portal veins. There is a feeding catheter which is placed in the duodenum. There is extensive pneumatosis (red arrows). The curved arrow indicates the markers that were placed in preparation of the CT-guided drainage. Based on these findings the patient was transferred for emergency laparotomy, because bowel ischemia was suspected. At surgery the bowel was distended, but there were no signs of ischemia. The abscess was drained surgically and the patient did well. Finally it was concluded that the pneumatosis was probably the result of mucosal damage by the feeding catheter. This strange case should not mislead you. These CT-findings will always be suspective of bowel ischemia and necessitate emergency surgery in the proper clinical setting as was in this case.
Incidental pneumatosis:
Here images of a patient without any abdominal symptoms. There is pneumatosis, which was regarded as an incidental finding. Asymptomatic pneumatosis can be seen in patients with asthma and COPD.
Pneumatosis in mesenteric ischemia:
Pneumatosis is sometimes seen in mesenteric ischemia and is a sign of pending perforation and necrosis. In this patient there is an occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (red arrow). This has resulted in ischemia of the right colon with pneumatosis. Notice the subtle portal venous gas in the left lobe of the liver (yellow arrow).
Degree of mural thickening:
The diseases that cause the largest bowel wall thickening are Crohn's disease and Pseudomembranous colitis (PMC).
Mesenteric abnormalities:
Patency of the mesenteric vesselsThe causes of bowel ischemia are arterial occlusion, venous thrombosis, strangulation and a low flow state. The image shows a large segment of ileum with poor enhancement. In the mesentery there is edema and venous engorgement. These findings indicate ischemia. Notice the thrombus within the superior mesenteric vein. Fistula formation in a patient with Crohn's disease. Mesenteric changes In the mesentery we look for: Here we see a fistula between the small bowel and the colon in a patient with Crohn's disease. Mesenteric edema Mesenteric edema in association with bowel wall thickening is seen in: These images are of a patient with a closed loop small bowel obstruction. Notice the group of small bowel loops with a thickened wall in the right upper abdomen (yellow arrow). The mesenteric edema (red arrow) indicates increased venous pressure due to strangulation. Engorgement of vessels Increased venous pressure in strangulation also leads to engorgement of veins (yellow arrow). This patient also has a closed loop obstruction with gray enhancement pattern of the strangulated bowel loops (red arrows). Notice the normal enhancement of small bowel proximal to the obstruction (green arrow). Another patient with ischemic bowel and extensive mesenteric edema.

Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis:
Barbara Simons, Geert Lycklama a Nijeholt and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Medical Centre Haaglanden in the Hague and the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2010-10-21 Cerebral venous thrombosis is an important cause of stroke especially in children and young adults. It is more common than previously thought and frequently missed on initial imaging. It is a difficult diagnosis because of its nonspecific clinical presentation and subtle imaging findings. In this article we will focus on: Pitfalls. Introduction
Introduction:
Cerebral venous thrombosis is located in descending order in the following venous structures: Internal cerebral and thalamostriate veins.
* Cavernous sinus. Clinically patients with cerebral venous thrombosis present with variable symptoms ranging from headache to seizure and coma in severe cases. In neonates shock and dehydration is a common cause of venous thrombosis. In older children it is often local infection, such as mastoiditis, or coagulopathy. In adults, coagulopathies is the cause in 70% and infection is the cause in 10% of cases. In women, oral contraceptive use and pregnancy are strong risk factors.
When to think of venous thrombosis:
Venous thrombosis has a nonspecific presentation and therefore it is important to recognize subtle imaging findings and indirect signs that may indicate the presence of thrombosis. Although these findings are often present on initial scans, they are frequently detected only in retrospect. Clinically patients with venous thrombosis often present with seizures, which is not a symptom in patients with an arterial infarction. On a routine non-enhanced MR or CT you should think of the possibility of venous thrombosis when you see:
Dense clot sign:
Direct visualization of a clot in the cerebral veins on a non enhanced CT scan is known as the dense clot sign. It is seen in only one third of cases. Normally veins are slightly denser than brain tissue and in some cases it is difficult to say whether the vein is normal or too dense (see pitfalls). In these cases a contrast enhanced scan is necessary to solve this problem. Dense clot sign in a thrombosed cortical vein. Dense clot sign (2) Visualization of a thrombosed cortical vein that is seen as a linear or cord-like density, is also known as the cord sign. Another term that is frequently used, is the dense vessel sign. Dense clot sign (3) On the left images of a patient with a hemorrhagic infarction in the temporal lobe (red arrow). Notice the dense transverse sinus due to thrombosis (blue arrows). Two cases of empty delta sign due to thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.
Empty delta sign:
The empty delta sign is a finding that is seen on a contrast enhanced CT (CECT) and was first described in thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. The sign consists of a triangular area of enhancement with a relatively low-attenuating center, which is the thrombosed sinus. The likely explanation is enhancement of the rich dural venous collateral circulation surrounding the thrombosed sinus, producing the central region of low attenuation. In early thrombosis the empty delta sign may be absent and you will have to rely on non-visualization of the thrombosed vein on the CECT. The sign may be absent after two months due to recanalization within the thrombus. Empty delta sign (2) On the left a case of thrombosis of the right transverse sinus and the left transverse and sigmoid sinus (arrows). There is enhancement surrounding the thrombosed hypoattenuating veins. Venous thrombosis with absence of normal flow void on T2-weighted image..
Absence of normal flow void on MR:
On spin-echo images patent cerebral veins usually will demonstrate low signal intensity due to flow void. Flow voids are best seen on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, but can sometimes also be seen on T1-weighted images. A thrombus will manifest as absence of flow void. Although this is not a completely reliable sign, it is often one of the first things, that make you think of the possibility of venous thrombosis. The next step has to be a contrast enhanced study. On the left a T2-weighted image with normal flow void in the right sigmoid sinus and jugular vein (blue arrow). On the left there is abnormal high signal as a result of thrombosis (red arrow). Venous thrombosis with absence of normal flow void on T1-weighted image. Absence of normal flow void on MR (2)
The images on the left show abnormal high signal on the T1-weighted images due to thrombosis. The thrombosis extends from the deep cerebral veins and straight sinus to the transverse and sigmoid sinus on the right. Notice the normal flow void in the left transverse sinus on the right lower image. Absence of normal flow void on MR-images can be very helpful in detecting venous thrombosis, but there are some pitfalls as we will discuss later. Slow flow can occur in veins and cause T1 hyperintensity.
Venous infarction:
The other sign that can help you in making the diagnosis of unsuspected venous thrombosis is venous infarction. Venous thrombosis leads to a high venous pressure which first results in vasogenic edema in the white matter of the affected area. When the proces continues it may lead to infarction and development of cytotoxic edema next to the vasogenic edema. This is unlike in an arterial infarction in which there is only cytotoxic edema and no vasogenic edema. Due to the high venous pressure hemorrhage is seen more frequently in venous infarction compared to arterial infarction. Since we are not that familiar with venous infarctions, we often think of them as infarctions in an atypical location or in a non-arterial distribution. However venous infarctions do have a typical distribution, as shown on the left. Since many veins are midline structures, venous infarcts are often bilateral. This is seen in thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, straight sinus and the internal cerebral veins. Bilateral infarction in superior sagittal sinus thrombosis Venous infarction (2) - Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis The most frequently thrombosed venous structure is the superior sagittal sinus. Infarction is seen in 75% of cases. The abnormalities are parasagittal and frequently bilateral. Hemorrhage is seen in 60% of the cases. On the left bilateral parasagittal edema and subte hemorrhage in a patient with thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. On the left reconstructed sagittal CT-images in a patient with bilateral parasagittal hemorrhage due to thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. The red arrow on the contrast enhanced image indicates the filling defect caused by the thrombus. Venous infarct in Labbe territory Venous infarcts (3) - vein of Labbe Another typical venous infarction is due to thrombosis of the vein of Labbe. On the left images demonstrating hypodensity in the white matter and less pronounced in the gray matter of the left temporal lobe. There is a broad differential diagnosis including arterial infarction, infection, tumor etc. Notice that there is some linear density within the infarcted area. This is due to hemorrhage. In the differential diagnosis we also should include a venous infarct in the territory of the vein of Labbe. The subtle density in the area of the left transverse sinus (arrow) is the key to the diagnosis. This is a direct sign of thrombosis and the next step is a CECT, which confirmed the diagnosis (not shown). Hemorrhagic venous infarct in Labbe territory On the left images of a patient with hemorrhage in the temporal lobe. When the hemorrhagic component of the infarction is large, it may look like any other intracerebral hematoma with surrounding vasogenic edema. The clue to the diagnosis in this case is seen on the contrast enhanced image, which nicely demonstrates the filling defect in the sigmoid sinus (blue arrow). Hemorrhagic venous infarct in Labbe territory On the left a similar case on MR. There is a combination of vasogenic edema (red arrow), cytotoxic edema and hemorrhage (blue arrow). These findings and the location in the temporal lobe, should make you think of venous infarction due to thrombosis of the vein of Labbe. The next examination should be a contrast enhanced MR or CT to prove the diagnosis. Venous thrombosis of vein of Galen and straight sinus Venous infarction (4) - Deep cerebral veins On the far left a FLAIR image demonstrating high signal in the left thalamus. When you look closely and you may have to enlarge the image to appreciate this, there is also high signal in the basal ganglia on the right. These bilateral findings should raise the suspicion of deep cerebral venous thrombosis. A sagittal CT reconstruction demonstrates a filling defect in the straight sinus and the vein of Galen (arrows). On the left a young patient with bilateral abnormalities in the region of the basal ganglia. Based on the imaging findings there is a broad differential including small vessel disease, demyelinisation, intoxication and metabolic disorders. Continue with the T1-weighted images in this patient. Bilateral infarctions in the basal ganglia due to deep cerebral venous thrombosis Notice the abnormal high signal in the internal cerebral veins and straight sinus on the T1-weighted images, where there should be a low signal due to flow void. This was unlike the low signal in other sinuses. The diagnosis is bilateral infarctions in the basal ganglia due to deep cerebral venous thrombosis. Venous infarction (5) - Edema In some cases of venous thrombosis the imaging findings can resolve completely. On the left a patient with a subcortical area of high signal intensity. The first impression was that this could be a low grade glioma. On a follow up scan the abnormalities had resolved completely. In retrospect a dense vessel sign was seen in one of the cortical veins and the diagnosis of venous thrombosis was made. The high signal intensity can be attributed to vasogenic edema due to the high venous pressure that resulted from the thrombosis.

CT-venography:
CT-venography is a simple and straight forward technique to demonstrate venous thrombosis. In the early stage there is non-enhancement of the thrombosed vein and in a later stage there is non-enhancement of the thrombus with surrounding enhancement known as empty delta sign, as discussed before. Unlike MR, CT-venography virtually has no pitfalls. The only thing that you don't want to do, is to scan too early, i.e. before the veins enhance or too late, i.e. when the contrast is gone. Some advocate to do a scan like a CT-arteriography and just add 5-10 seconds delay. To be on the safe side we advocate 45-50 seconds delay after the start of contrast injection. We use at least 70 cc of contrast. On the left some images of a CT-venography demonstrating thrombosis in many sinuses. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll On the left images of a patient with an infarction in the area of the vein of Labbe. On the non-enhanced images you can appreciate the dense thrombus within the transverse sinus and the hemorrhage in the infarcted area. On the enhanced images a filling defect can be seen in the transverse sinus. You can scroll through the images. Transverse MIP image of a Phase-Contrast angiography.The right transverse sinus and jugular vein have no signal due to thrombosis.
MR-venography:
The MR-techniques that are used for the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis are: Time-of-flight (TOF), phase-contrast angiography (PCA) and contrast-enhanced MR-venography: As a result of being unsaturated, these spins give more signal that surrounding saturated spins.
* Phase-contrast angiography uses the principle that spins in blood that is moving in the same direction as a magnetic field gradient develop a phase shift that is proportional to the velocity of the spins. This information can be used to determine the velocity of the spins. This image can be subtracted from the image, that is acquired without the velocity encoding gradients, to obtain an angiogram.
* Contrast-enhanced MR-venography uses the T1-shortening of Gadolinium. It is similar to contrast-enhanced CT-venography. When you use MIP-projections, always look at the source images. On the left a lateral and oblique MIP image from a normal contrast-enhanced MR venography. Notice the prominent vein of Trolard (red arrow) and vein of Labbe (blue arrow). Every MR techniques has its own pitfalls as we will discuss in a moment. Contrast-enhanced MR venography has the disadvantage that you need to give contrast, but has less pitfalls.
DSA:
Angiography is only performed in severe cases, when an intervention is planned. On the left images of a patient with venous thrombosis, who was unconsious and did not respond to anticoagulant therapy. There is thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus (red arrow), straight sinus (blue arrow) and transverse and sigmoid sinus (yellow arrow). Continue with the video of the thrombectomy. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. On the left a video of the thrombectomy.
Pitfalls in CT:

Arachnoid Granulations:
Arachnoid granulations are small protrusions of the arachnoid through the dura mater. They protrude into the venous sinuses and may mimic filling defects caused by thrombus. Usually these granulations are easily to differentiate from thrombosis. Normal transverse sinus (left) and thrombosed transverse sinus (right).
Mimick of dense clot sign:
Normally veins are slightly denser than brain tissue and in some cases it is difficult to say whether it is normal or too dense. In these cases a contrast enhanced scan is necessary to solve this problem. On the left an image of a thrombosed transverse sinus and next to it a normal transverse sinus. Mimick of dense clot sign in an infant In infants the brain is usually less dense than in older children and adults. This results in a relative high density of the blood in the sagittal sinus compared to the brain, which simulates a dense clot sign. Hematoma mimicking a dense clot sign Hematoma simulating dense clot sign. Usually there is no problem in differentiating a hematoma from a thrombosed sinus. Here a patient with a peripheral intracerebral hematoma. Because it is located in the area of the transverse sinus it simulates a thrombosed transverse sinus.
Pseudo empty delta sign:
Here a patient with a subdural hematoma on the left side, that has spread to the region of the superior sagittal sinus (arrows). At first impression this looks like an empty delta sign. By scrolling through the data set, it was obvious that it was an extention of the hematoma. A hyperdense empyema can sometimes also mimick an empty delta sign.
Wrong bolus timing:
On the left three images of a patient with venous thrombosis in the superior sagittal sinus. On the far left we see a dense vessel sign on the unenhanced CT. In the middle an image made 25 seconds after the start of the contrast injection. There is arterial enhancement and it looks as if the superior sagittal sinus enhances, but in fact what we see is the shine through of the dense thrombus. Only on the image on the right, which was made 45 seconds after contrast injection there is an empty delta sign, which proves the presence of a thrombus in the sinus.
Pitfalls in MRI:

Hypoplastic transverse sinus:
Hypoplasia and aplasia of the right or left transverse sinus is a common finding. It can easily be mistaken for sinus thrombosis, because on the MRA one of the transverse sinuses is missing. When you suspect, that there is a hypoplastic transverse sinus, then you should look at the size of the jugular foramen. On the left images of a patient with hypoplasia of the left transverse sinus. Notice the size difference of the jugular foramen. On the left a transverse MIP of phase-contrast images. To differentiate whether there is a hypoplastic transverse sinus or thrombosed sinus, you need to look at the source images. On the source image on the right you can see that there is no hypoplasia (blue arrow). In this case there thrombosis of the left transverse sinus. On the left another case that demonstrates that you cannot fully rely on phase contrast imaging. The signal in the vein depends on the velocity of the flowing blood and the velocity encoding by the technician. On the far left a patient with non visualization of the left transverse sinus. This could be hypoplasia, venous thrombosis or slow flow. On the contrast enhanced T1-weighted image it is obvious that the sinus fills with contrast and is patent. Thrombus in right transverse sinus is dark on T2 due to intracellular deoxyhemoglobin (Courtesy dr. Howard Rowley)
Low signal intensity in thrombus:
Normally when there is low signal in a vein, it is attributed to flow void and a sign of patency of the vein. However at some stage of the thrombus there is intracellular deoxyhemoglobin, which is dark on T2 and mimics flow void. On the left there is a thrombosed right transverse sinus with a delta sign on the contrast enhanced image. The sinus has a low signal intensity on the T2-weighted image as a result of the intracellular deoxyhemoglobin. On the contrast enhanced T1-weighted image it is obvious that the sinus is filled with thrombus.
Flow void on contrast-enhanced MR:
On the contrast enhanced T1 images on the left there is an area of low signal intensity within the enhancing transverse sinus. This could easily been mistaken for a central thrombus within the sinus. This however is the result of flow void. Continue with the phase contrast images. On the phase contrast images it is obvious that the transverse sinus is patent. We can conclude that MRI has many false positives and negatives in the diagnosis of venous thrombosis.
Contrast enhanced MR-venography is the most reliable MR technique.
CT-venography is even more reliable, because it is easy and less sensitive to pitfalls. Pitfalls in TOF imaging are:
Chronic dural sinus thrombosis and related syndromes:

DAVF:
Chronic dural sinus thrombosis can lead to dural arteriovenous fistula formation and to increased CSF pressure. A DAVF or dural arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between dural arteries, which are branches of the external carotid with the venous sinuses.
Sinus thrombosis is seen in many patients with a dural arteriovenous fistula, but the pathogenesis is still unclear (10). There are two possible mechanisms: (a) thrombophlebitis of the dural sinus may induce a dural fistula and (b) in the course of a dural fistula flow reversal may lead to thrombosis. Current classifications of DAVF focus mainly on the presence of leptomeningeal reflux related to cerebral venous hypertension leading to cerebral venous infarction or hemorrhage. On the left DSA images of a patient with a DAVF.
Notice the direct communication between the branches of the external carotid artery and the transverse sinus (blue arrow). Continue with the T2-weighted images. On the left T2-images during the follow up. In april 2008 there were no abnormalities. In january 2009 there are signs of intracranial hypertension like CSF surrounding the optic nerve and CSF within the stalk of the hypophysis.
Thrombosis and increased CSF pressure:
In some patients dural sinus thrombosis may, even after recanalisation, lead to persisting disturbances in venous circulation. This may lead to raised intracranial CSF pressure as assessed by lumbar puncture. Clinically, these patients complain of headaches and they may have vision disturbances due to papil edema. On MRI, one may see increased CSF around the optic nerve and an empty sella. Apparently in some patients a residual stenosis persists. On the left a T2-weighted image demonstrating papil edema and an empty sella. Continue with the sagittal T1-weighted image. Here the sagittal T1-weighted image demonstrating the empty sella (arrow). It is called an empty sella because the sella is mainly filled with CSF as the hypofysis is compressed downwards due to the increased intracranial pressure.

Hamstring injury:
Anne van der Made, Frank Smithuis, Gino Kerkhoffs and Mario Maas
Department of orthopedics and radiology of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre:
Publicationdate 14-11-2022 The diagnosis of a hamstring injury is a clinical one and fairly straightforward. 
The role of MRI is not to determine the presence or absence of injury, but to determine whether there is a partial or full thickness tear. Full thickness tears are typically injuries to the free tendons or the insertion of the tendons on the ischial tuberosity. 
In these injuries the question is whether a surgical repair is needed. Partial thickness injuries are most often injuries to the musculotendinous or musculofascial junction.
These injuries usually do not require surgery. The goal of imaging is to determine the prognosis and to guide the return to normal function.
Introduction:

Anatomy:
The hamstrings are the muscles in the posterior compartment of the thigh and consist of the biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus.
They are innervated by the sciatic nerve and contraction results in extention of the hip and flexion of the knee.
The conjoint tendon is formed by the long head of the biceps femoris laterally and the semitendinosus tendon medially. Biceps femoris
The biceps femoris muscle has two heads. 
The long head originates from the ischial tuberosity, while the short head originates from the linea aspera on the posterior surface of the femur. 
The common tendon of the two heads can be felt laterally at the posterior knee and inserts onto the head of the fibula. Semitendinosus
The semitendinosus is a largely tendinous muscle, which is located medially to the biceps femoris, and covers the majority of the semimembranosus muscle. Semimembranosus
The semimembranosus muscle is flattened and broad. It is located underneath the semitendinosus. Here the anatomy is shown on a coronal MR image. The insertion of the semitendinosus (2) on the hamstring origin is partly muscular. The free tendon is attached to the ischial tuberosity, it has no muscle fibers attached to it. The interface between tendon and muscle fibers is the musculotendinous junction. The part of the tendon with muscle fibers attached to it is the intramuscular tendon. The muscle itself is surrounded by the fascia. The hamstrings insert on the upper region of the ischial tuberosity. On this posterior view you will notice that the semimembranous tendon inserts on the lateral side, while the muscle is located medially.
The Conjoint tendon of the biceps femoris and the semitendinosus inserts on the medial facet. The ice cream flavors (also see the dropped icecream sign in full thickness injuries) can serve as a mnemonic for which tendon is affected: 
Caramel - Conjoint medial 
Stracciatella - Semimembranosus lateral
Pathology specimen:
This is posterior view of a specimen of the right proximal hamstring complex after removal of the gluteus muscle. The biceps femoris and semitendinosus muscle attach on the ischial tuberosity by means of a conjoint tendon, which has a superficial connection to the sacrotuberous ligament (STL). When the tendons are avulsed from the tuber but the connection with this ligament is intact, the STL can act as a ‘lifeline’ to prevent tendon retraction. Note that the semitendinosus also has muscle fibers directly attaching to the ischial tuberosity. The tendon of the semimembranosus runs underneath the conjoint tendon and attaches more lateral on the ischial tuberosity. Here the semitendinosus and biceps femoris are held aside to get a better view on the semimembranosus muscle and tendon.
Notice that the semimembranosus tendon attaches lateral to the conjoint tendon. The sciatic nerve lies in close proximity to the proximal hamstring attachment, about one centimeter lateral. On this axial MR-image note the aponeurotic connection between the sacrotuberous ligament and the superficial part of the conjoint tendon. In some cases, the tendons may be avulsed from the ischial tuberosity while this connection remains intact. In these cases no retraction will be present and surgery is usually not necessary.
British athletics muscle injury classification:
BAMIC is the most commonly used classification system for hamstring injuries. Grade 0-3 are partial thickness injuries.
An additional suffix 'a', 'b' or 'c' indicates if the partial thickness injury is: Grade 4 is a full thickness tear with or without retraction.
Partial thickness injuries (grade 0-3):
Partial thickness injuries (grade 0-3) usually involve the musculotendinous junction with or without waviness of the intramuscular tendon.
Sometimes the area where the muscle attaches to the fascia is involved. This is called a myofascial or epimysial injury.
Full thickness injuries (grade 4):
In young patients this can be an apophysiolysis of the ischial tuberosity. In adults it is either a tendon avulsion or a free tendon tear. Modifiers in the decision-making process and part of pre-operative planning are:
MRI report:
There is great interest in and debate how MRI findings can help guide prognosis, progression through the rehabilitation programme, and return-to-play decision-making. This accounts most for partial thickness injuries. Therefore, all points from MRI report on the left are noted (with special interest for length of edema and distortion), although it remains unclear which finding is best in predicting prognosis.
Partial thickness injury:
The vast majority of partial hamstring injuries are located at the musculotendinous junction (MTJ), where forces are transmitted from muscle fibers to the fibers of the intramuscular tendon. These injuries are typically seen when athletes reach for the posterior thigh in a sprint. These injuries occur with or without concomitant injury of the intramuscular tendon. Partial-thickness hamstring injuries are treated non-operatively with a phased rehabilitation program.
Length of edema:
Presence of edema can be used to localize the injury.
Edema is typically present as feather-shaped high signal intensity as it surrounds the intramuscular tendon and fascicles. Total length of the edema is noted (white dotted line). Now take a closer look at the tendon (yellow dotted line) and continue reading.
Length of tendon distortion:
When the tendon looks normal, straining is probable low grade. 
Tendon thickening, tendon waviness, high signal of the tendon can all be signs of higher grade straining. Case 1: normal tendon. 
Case 2 slightly thickening and wavy aspect of a short length of the tendon. 
Case 3: obvious thickening and waviness All these signs have to be described in your report. 
Total length of the distorted tendon is noted.
Coronal versus axial:
Based on coronal images alone, it is sometimes challenging to exactly classify the amount of distortion. Use the axial images to get a closer look. On these axial images, high signal and thickening of the left biceps femoris tendon (yellow dotted circle) is seen when compared to the non-injured side (white dotted circle). DOMS
In this patient, subtle muscle edema in the semitendinosus was seen, diagnosed as DOMS - delayed onset muscle soreness (arrow). Both length of edema and distorted tendon are measured and noted in the report. In this case, biceps femoris tendon injury was classified as grade 3 partial injury, since the length of the edema is > 15cm (white dotted line) and the length of the distorted tendon is > 5cm (yellow dotted line). Two more cases to demonstrate this classification. A muscle edema 5-10cm (white dotted line) present at the MTJ without architectural distortion of the tendon, classified as BAMIC 2b. B muscle edema >15cm (white dotted line), at the MTJ / intramuscular tendon, tendon distortion > 5cm (yellow dotted line). The tendon shows disruption with loss of low signal intensity within the tendon along with a wavy appearance indicating focal loss of tension. BAMIC 3b/c.

Since both features cover quite a distance, these are poor prognostic factors. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Here you can scroll through the axial images. You can enlarge the images by clicking on them. This is a partial injury, it starts at the conjoined tendon proximal, covers both the MTJ and intramuscular tendon more distally. Length of edema and tendon distortion are of high grade. This was classified as a BAMIC 3b/c injury.
Full thickness injury:

Free tendon tear:
In full thickness injuries, the free tendon is torn and  discontinuous with the ischial tuberosity. Since tension is lost, the tendon and muscle will retract from the tuberosity and a gap is seen. The extent of tendon retraction or is considered an important factor for treatment decision-making.
Some experts advocate surgical repair when retraction is more than 2 centimeters.
Direct measurement of retraction:
The most reliable method to quantify retraction is the ‘direct measurement’ on a coronal fluid-sensitive sequence. First, the point representing the center (white triangle) of the proximal hamstring complex origin on the upper region (dotted line) of the ischial tuberosity (IT) is determined. 
From this point, the direct (ie, shortest) distance (white arrow) to the most proximal part of the hypointense tendon stump (black triangles) is measured (in cm). Note that determining the anatomic landmarks is done on different images within one MRI sequence.
Dropped icecream sign:
It is best to determine which tendon is torn on axial images. The ischial tuberosity can be regarded as an icecream cone with the tendon of the semimembranosus (anterolateral ) and the conjoint tendon (posteromedial ) as two scoops with the flavor StracciatelLa CaraMel. The image shows an avulsion of the semimembranosus tendon. ① tendon of the semimembranosus 
② conjoint tendon Remember the flavours: Stracciatella - Semimembranosus lateralCaramel - Conjoint medial In this patient both the right semimembranosus tendon aswell as the conjoint tendon are avulsed. Both scoops have dropped. On these images a full thickness injury is seen. 
Both scoops have dropped on the axial images, so both tendons are avulsed. On coronal images total retraction was measured and noted. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Apophysiolysis:
In adolescents, a proximal hamstring injury is most likely located at the level of the ischial apophysis, since the bones are the weakest link. 
Injury of the tendon itself or at the musculotendinous junction is rare. This video shows an avulsion of the apophysis on CT. 
Continue with the MRI... Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. MRI of the same patient.
Ischiadic nerve involvement:
This image shows a partial injury of the conjoined tendon of the right leg (yellow circle).
There is a large amount of surrounding hematoma in the muscle and alongside the fascia. The edema surrounds the ischiadic nerve (yellow arrow), which can lead to neuropathy. 
However there is a poor correlation between the MRI findings and the symptoms of the patient. In this case, the partial injury is less pronounced. Still, the ischiadic nerve is enlarged and flattened due to the injury edema. All features of possible nerve involvement (nerve enlargement, flattening, nerve edema, surrounding edema or surrounding fibrosis) are noted.
Follow up:

Old injury:
After the injury, it is possible that the tendon looks normal after healing. However, in most partial injuries, fibrous scarring is seen at the site of the previous injury (yellow dotted circle). Quite often, when MRI is made for an acute injury, other sites of fibrous scarring of older injuries are seen.
Reinsertion:
After a full thickness avulsion, tendons can be reinserted operatively. In this case, the anchors at the tuber can be seen. As a result from the injury, fatty atrophy of the muscle belly can occur.
MRI protocol:
The MRI protocol is based on a coronal fatsat, Axial PD fatsat and axial T2 sequences. The entire hamstring complex on both legs should be scanned on all sequences to compare the injured side with the non-injured hamstrings. 
Especially partial injuries can be very subtle.
We only use coronal and axial planes for anatomy as it is more difficult to assess anatomy on sagittal planes.

Publicationdate 2007-11-26 In Esophagus part I we will discuss: Vascular impressions. Anatomy and Function
Anatomy and Function:
LEFT: Lateral view: Epiglottis (red arrow). Post cricoid impression (yellow arrows). Cricopharyngeous impression (white arrow).RIGHT: AP-view: Small lateral pharyngeal pouches (arrows)
Hypopharynx:
Common structures that we can visualize are: If a normal pouch becomes enlarged, it is termed a lateral pharyngeal diverticulum.
* Cricopharyngeal muscle impression:
Extrinsic impression on posterior esophagus by contracted muscle. Esophagus mucosa: normal thin, parallel, uniform mucosal folds The esophageal wall is composed of: Normal gastroesophageal junction (left), Fundal adenocarcinoma invades esophagus (right) At the gastroesophageal junction smooth, uniform folds in gastric fundus converge on very distal esophagus (arrow). Image next to it shows abnormal gastroesophageal junction: Barium outlines thick, irregular mucosal folds (asterisks). Fundal adenocarcinoma invades esophagus (arrows) Cricopharyngeal achalasia in 46-year-old woman. Feeling of lump in throat. Persistent indentation (arrow) by cricopharyngeus muscle that does not relax as bolus progresses caudally
Upper esophageal sphincter:

Lower esophageal sphincter:
This distention is best demonstrated by breath holding in inspiration or a Valsalva maneuver. Do not mistake this for a hiatal hernia. Spontaneous reflux extends to level of aortic arch.
Gastroesophageal reflux:
Spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux has been demonstrated in up to 1/3 of patients with reflux esophagitis. Various maneuvers during the examination have been used to increase sensitivity, but these are generally discredited as not being physiologic. In addition many asymptomatic patients have spontaneous reflux so that reflux during an esophagram is not sensitive or specific for relating symptoms to reflux.
Esophageal peristalsis:
Normal: Abnormal: On the left tertiary contractions on first swallow (left). Normal primary contraction on next swallow (right). These tertiary contractions are non-propulsive, transient, and intermittent contractions that are inconstant in location and not accompanied by symptoms, usually in older patients. A. Initial nonpropulsive tertiary contractions B. Three images during examination show collections resembling diverticula C. Image later in examination shows resolution of tertiary contractions Sometimes transient tertiary contractions may simulate diverticula. On the left images of a patient with tertiary contractions, that during the examination look like diverticula. Diffuse esophageal spasm. Patient experienced chest pain during examination
Diffuse esophageal spasm:
Diffuse esophageal spasm produces intermittent contractions of the mid and distal esophageal smooth muscle, associated with chest symptoms. Manometry shows simultaneous nonpropulsive contractions on at least 10% of swallows. Diagnosis is based on imaging, manometry, and symptoms.
Nutcracker esophagus:
Nutcracker esophagus is a non-cardiac cause of chest pain attributed to high amplitude distal esophageal peristalsis. This is a controversial diagnosis that is made by manometry and does not have imaging manifestations LEFT: Dilated esophagus (arrows) appears as long, well-defined structure paralleling heart RIGHT: Dilated esophagus usually deviates to right.

On the left a patient with a 'B' ring (arrows) several cm above diaphragm at the apex of sliding hiatus hernia. Note unchanged appearance on these two images. On the left a 52-year-old man with episodic dysphagia. The image on the far left does not show a abnormality, but distal esophagus not distended . With dilation of the distal esophagus, a 13 mm wide Schatzki B-ring (arrows) that caused intermittent obstruction is demonstrated at the apex of a hiatus hernia (arrowhead). On the left a 71-year-old man with chest pain after fast food lunch. Distal obstructing filling defect (arrow) is a piece of meat that passed into stomach during study. Follow-up esophagram shows Schatzki B-ring (arrows) that caused obstruction.
Webs and Diverticula:

Esophageal web:
On the left images of an asymptomatic 52-year-old man. AP and Lateral views show short, thin web (arrows) with minimal intraluminal extension. On the left images of a 42-year-old woman with dysphagia due to web. There is > 50% luminal narrowing Zenker's diverticulum in early and late phase of swallowing
Diverticula:
Pulsion diverticula are due to increased intraluminal pressure.
There are many pulsion diverticula: On the left a patient with a Zenker's diverticulum as a result of premature closure of the cricopharyngeal muscle. Traction diverticula are secondary to adjacent disease. Most located in mid-esophagus. Zenker's diverticulum on chest film, barium study and CT
Zenker's diverticulum:
A Zenker's diverticulum is a pulsion hypopharyngeal false diverticulum with only
mucosa and submucosa protruding through triangular posterior wall weak
site (Killian's dehiscence) between horizontal and oblique components
of cricopharyngeus muscle. The etiology is controversial and is probably due to elevated upper esophageal
pressure, cricopharyngeus dysfunction and reflux. The clinical presentation can be dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration
or a mass or air-fluid level on neck or chest radiographs. The esophagram shows collection with midline posterior origin just above
cricopharyngeus protruding lateral, usually to left, and caudal with
enlargement. Killian-Jamieson diverticulum: AP and lateral view Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is a pulsion diverticulum, that protrudes through a lateral anatomic weak site of the cervical esophagus below the cricopharyngeus muscle, unlike the posterior, midline origin of a Zenker's diverticulum. AP view shows diverticulum (arrow) originating laterally. Lateral view confirms diverticulum does not originate posteriorly as a Zenkers diverticulum would. LEFT: Small diverticulum (arrow) in asymptomatic patient RIGHT: Large diverticulum (arrow) in patient with aspiration Epiphrenic diverticulum These pulsion diverticula are classified by their location near the diaphragm. /ul>

The CT demonstrates a large diverticulum (arrow) extends to the right just above diaphragm. This patient was asymptomatic Aortopulmonary window diverticulum The normal esophagus transiently protrudes into the aortopulmonary window. 
Fixed protrusion is an inconsequential diverticulum. On the left small aortopulmonary diverticula (arrows), that are incidental findings in two patients. On the far left a traction diverticulum (arrow) due to hilar granulomatous disease.

MIDDLE: Communicating esophageal duplication (arrows). RIGHT: Extravasation from iatrogenic perforation of hypopharynx in neonate Other pathologic conditions can simulate diverticula.
On the left two patients with a iatrogenic perforation and a patient with a communicating duplication cyst.
Hiatus hernia:
The types of hiatus hernia are listed in the table on the left. The relationship between hiatus hernia, reflux and reflux esophagitis is controversial and poorly understood. Most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have hernias. Many patients with hiatus hernias do not have reflux. Many patients with reflux do not have hiatus hernias. Presence of reflux correlates poorly with GERD.
A sliding hiatus hernia is of doubtful significance when an isolated finding in the absence of clinical or imaging findings of esophagitis. Diagnosis of GERD is based on imaging or endoscopic findings of esophagitis, not presence of a hiatus hernia. Sliding hernia On the left initially, GE junction is below the esophageal hiatus. Later, stomach protrudes through hiatus. Neither the hernia or stricture (arrow) due to reflux esophagitis were visible early in the examination. Paraesophageal hernia Large hernias can cause symptoms, and with progressive hiatal widening, increasing protrusion and rotation of the stomach can lead to gastric volvulus that can be complicated by hemorrhage, obstruction, strangulation, perforation. On the left two examples. On the far left gas filled gastric fundus (asterisk) protrudes through hiatus but GE junction (arrow) is below diaphragm. Next to it a paraesophageal hernia with most of 'upside down' stomach in chest with greater curvature (arrows) flipped up. On the left a mixed hernia. Distal esophagus is adjacent to the herniated gastric fundus, but unlike a paraesophageal hernia, the gastroesophageal junction (arrow) is above rather than below the diaphragm.
Inflammation and Infection:
Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is the most common cause of esophagitis. Other causes of esophagitis are listed in the table on the left.
Reflux esophagitis:
The findings on barium studies are listed in the table on the left. Air-contrast esophagram shows thick esophageal mucosal folds (arrows) and an ulcer (arrowhead) due to GERD. Single contrast esophagram shows stricture (arrow) and sliding hiatus hernia On the left Irregular stricture (arrowhead) and erosions (arrows) due to GERD.

On the left a patient with esophageal pseudodiverticulosis. Eosinophilic esophagitis This diagnosis may be suggested by peripheral eosinophilia and confirmed by > 20 eosinophils per HPF on biopsy. Patients often have dysphagia and allergies. Imaging finding include diffuse narrowing, strictures, and a ringed appearance similar to transverse (feline esophagus) folds that are transient or associated with reflux. Steroid therapy is often curative. On the left a patient with eosinophilic esophagitis. There is diffuse distal narrowing and corrugated margins (arrows) due to ring-like indentations, that are characteristic of eosinophilic esophagitis.

Gallbladder obstruction:
by Julien Puylaert
Medical center Haaglanden in the Hague and Academical Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Most gallstones that we find with ultrasound are asymptomatic and should be left untreated.
However when gallstones obstruct the gallbladder or the common bile duct they become symptomatic. 
In part 2 we will discuss stones that obstruct the biliary ducts. In part 1 we will discuss gallstones that obstruct the gallbladder. We will focus on: For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com
Introduction:

Symptomatic stones:
Gallstones become symptomatic when they obstruct the gallbladder or the common bile duct (CBD).
Intermittent obstruction results in a simple biliary colic. An impacted stone obstructing the gallbladder results in acute hydrops. 
Persistent production of mucus causes high intraluminal pressure, leading to relative ischemia of the wall. Here another overview of the different pathways when there is an impacted stone in the gallbladder neck: It is important to realize that patients only experience pain during the hydrops phase. 
Laboratory data only show leucocytosis and the CRP remains normal. 
After the hydrops has disappeared, the colic is over but the patient often experiences a “sore feeling” for a while. CT for suspected aortic dissection. The only relevant finding were two CBD stones best visible on the non-contrast series (arrows).
Asymptomatic stones:
The majority of patients with gallstones however will not experience any problems with these stones during their lifetime.
Therefore, asymptomatic gallstones detected coincidentally during US or CT, performed for other reasons, are left untreated. The literature indicates that over 20 % of patients undergoing cholecystectomy, have unchanged symptoms after the operation, suggesting that the diagnosis of symptomatic gallstone disease was not correctly made. On the other hand, the diagnosis of acute gallstone disease can be missed because the doctor  mistakes the symptoms for another condition e.g. acute cardiovascular disease. 
This explains why around 15 % of patients with an acute biliary colic are initially referred to the cardiologist.
Biliary colic:
Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll When a gallstone intermittently obstructs the gallbladder or the CBD, a biliary colic will follow. Symptoms are often typical with episodes of intense pain in the upper abdomen, radiating to the back and to the right side, but also sometimes to the left side.  
Patients are often nauseous and may collapse from the pain. 
Not rarely, the pain awakes patients from their sleep.
During a biliary colic, patients preferably do not sit still, and have an urge to move and walk around. 
They continuously  “try to find a position to tolerate the pain”. When the stone is not obstructing the gallbladder neck at the time of the examination, it will be difficult to make the diagnosis of symptomatic gallstone disease and you will be able to compress the gallbladder fundus (fig). However in patients with  a history of typical, uncomplicated colicky attacks without signs of cholestasis, in whom stones in the gallbladder are demonstrated on US,  the indication for cholecystectomy is evident. On the other hand, in patients with atypical symptoms, it is not always clear whether the US-demonstrated gallstones are actually the cause of the patient’s symptoms, resulting in quite a few patients who have unchanged symptoms  after cholecystectomy. However in patients with  a history of typical, uncomplicated colicky attacks without signs of cholestasis, in whom stones in the gallbladder are demonstrated on US,  the indication for cholecystectomy is evident (fig). On the other hand, in patients with atypical symptoms, it is not always clear whether the US-demonstrated gallstones are actually the cause of the patient’s symptoms, resulting in quite a few patients who have unchanged symptoms  after cholecystectomy. This patient had typical colic pain a few days before the examination.
In the standing position there are no obstructing stones in the gallbladder neck.
Even the cystic duct was seen with its typical course parallel to de common bile duct. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll In case of an obstructing CBD stone, you will also be able to compress the gallbladder fundus, but there will be typical lab-findings with elevated liver function tests.
Dilatation of the biliary tree will develop within a very short time and the gallbladder may become dilated.
The intraluminal pressure however is much less than in isolated obstruction of the gallbladder (fig). US scanning during an episode of pain can be very helpful. 
Patients who undergo US during an acute biliary colic, at that particular moment –invariably-  either show a hydropic gallbladder or dilated biliary ducts.These US signs however may rapidly disappear when the obstruction is relieved, either spontaneously or due to spasmolytic medication, which is usaully given at the ER.
Acute Hydrops:

Hydrops sign:
Persistent obstruction of the gallbladder results in a hydropic gallbladder due to ongoing mucus production by the gallbladder mucosa. The hydrops sign is tested by applying graded compression over the gallbladder. The hydrops-sign is positive if the gallbladder during compression “bulges” into the abdominal wall and keeps its rounded contour (fig). This is best seen in expiration, when the abdominal wall muscles relax. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Here we can see how the hydropic gallbladder will keeps its rounded shape during compression.
If the obstruction carries on long enough, the high intraluminal  pressure may lead to temporary ischemia of the gallbladder wall. The US signs of acute hydrops due to an impacted stone obstructing the gallbladder, are given in the table. The non-compressibility of the gallbladder and direkt demonstration of the impacted stone in the galbladder neck or cystic duct are the most valuable signs (****). Here images of a patient with acute hydrops of the gallbladder, visualized in its longitudinal and its axial plane.
The obstructing stone is impacted (arrow). 
Note that during compression the hydropic gallbladder bulges into the abdominal wall (arrowheads), indicating high intraluminal pressure. It is however not always possible to visualize the hydrops-sign reliably, especially when the gallbladder lies high under the right costal arch. 
Also the impacted stone may be impossible to visualize in large persons, due to its deep location, far from the transducer. Not infrequently, also on CT scan hydrops of the gallbladder may be identified (fig), but often complementary US is very useful. Here images of a patient with clinically suspected stomach perforation. CT shows some stones in a rounded gallbladder. Complementary US unequivocally demonstrates hydrops (arrowheads). Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Even in the case, when there is intervening liver tissue between the abdominal wall and the gallbladder, an indirect “hydrops-sign” can be demonstrated. The left image shows a gallbladder that keeps  its rounded shape, without and during compression, and bulges into the soft interposing liver tissue and abdominal wall. Likewise, the absence of hydrops can be demonstrated,  even when there is intervening liver tissue, which is soft during compression (image on the right).
How to demonstrate an impacted stone:
In this patient examination in the decubitus position could not identify an obstructing stone  due to the presence of multiple stones. If  US in the standing position shows that all loose stones have migrated to the fundus, the patient is asked to lie down again, immediately turning on its left side. 
In this way the stones, will remain in the fundus, allowing better visualization of the gallbladder neck and cystic duct (fig). 
All stones have moved to the fundus except the impacted stone (arrow). There is gallbladder wall thickening indicating developing cholecystitis (CRP was 110). Note that in case of inspissated, viscous bile, stones may change position very slowly, sometimes taking several minutes to go to the lowest point. 
For this reason, we ask patients with suspected gallstones, always to sit or stand up while waiting for their US examination. Here two examples of impacted stone visualized during biliary colic in different patients. 
In the supine position a stone (arrow) is demonstrated in the gallbladder neck. 
After standing up, bending over and walking, the stone (arrow) does not fall down, and therefore must be impacted. Stones in the cystic duct are sometimes not demonstrable in the US plane of the longitudinal axis of the gallbladder. Here images of a patieny with acute hydrops due to an impacted stone. The impacted stone could not be visualized in the longitudinal axis of the gallbladder, due to its medial position in the cystic duct (arrow).
Large diameter:
The third sign is a large transverse diameter of the gallbladder.
This is not a very reliable sign, since gallbladder diameters have a wide range. 
A 2.5 cm gallbladder can be hydropic and a 5 cm diameter gallbladder can be normal (fig).Therefore, non-compressibility and preservation of the round shape during compression, remain the US hallmarks of hydrops.
US-Murphy-sign:
Finally, a sign of acute hydrops is  circumscribed tenderness on pressure with the US probe over the gallbladder fundus, the so-called US-Murphy-sign.
Although often present, this sign is not always reliable.
Especially older patients with an acute cholecystitis have difficulties exactly indicating the area of maximum tenderness. 
In addition, if another condition like a duodenal ulcer, acute pancreatitis or an acute appendicitis, causes the right upper quadrant pain, the US Murphy sign may be false-positive because of the close proximity of the gallbladder. Secondary wall thickening of the gallbladder may add to the confusion.
US performed after the biliary colic:

Silent witnesses:
What may cause considerable diagnostic confusion, is the fact that -in daily practice- most US examinations in patients with suspected symptomatic gallstones, are performed after the symptoms have subsided, with intervals varying from hours to weeks. 
Patients also may have received spasmolytic therapy, which may cause the muscle spasm to relax and bile to pass, changing the US image which can appear atypical and even confusing. There are silent witnesses that indicate that the patient had an obstructing stone with hydrops of the gallbladder (table). Follow up in 100 patients presenting with acute hydrops at the ER treated with spasmolytics and not immediately operated. In 15 acute cholecystitis developed. In 25 the stone remained in place, but bile can pass and hydrops disappears. In 60 patients the stone becomes dislodged and the galbladder returns to normal sometimes with a period of reperfusion edema. The natural course of a biliary colic due to an obstructing stone in the gallbladder neck has various pathways. During the colic the stone is impacted in the gallbladder neck with acute hydrops. 
Persistent production of mucinous fluid causes high intraluminal pressure, leading to ischemia of the wall. US performed 5 hours after the pain episode. There is both reperfusion edema and hyperemia of the gallbladder wall. The obstructing stone (arrow) is still visible in the neck, but there was no hydrops
Reperfusion edema:
It is important to realize that patients only experience pain during the hydrops phase. 
Laboratory data only show leucocytosis and the CRP remains normal. Soon, the intraluminal pressure will be so high that relative ischemia of the stretched thin gallbladder wall may occur.
If the stone is disimpacted or in another way again allows passage of  bile to the cystic duct, which may happen spontaneously or due to spasmolytic therapy, edema of the gallbladder wall may develop very rapidly (fig). This edema disappears again within 12-48 hours and is reperfusion-edema, secondary to the episode of ischemia.
Sometimes also the secondary hyperemia can be found by Doppler US (fig). After the hydrops has disappeared, the colic is over but the patient often experiences a “sore feeling” for a while. Images of a young woman with a biliary colic for 8 hours. 
US shows an impacted stone and hydrops. 
The patient went walking for an hour and US was repeated. 
The stone was loose, and reperfusion edema was visible as silent witnesses of the colic. 
CRP remained normal. When the hydrops has disappeared, patients do not have colicky pain any more. 
However patients often have a vague “sore” feeling in the upper abdomen as if someone has “stumped them in the belly”. It is obvious that it is essential to integrate the patient’s history, the laboratory data and the US findings in the final report of the US examination. At day 0 there is acute hydrops due to an impacted stone.
One day later, the patient is symptom free.
The stone is still in place, but apparently allows passage of bile to the cystic duct, since hydrops has  disappeared. Reperfusion edema and sludge are the silent witnesses of the previous attack .
CRP remained normal. Silent witness of previous attack.
US, performed 24 hours after colicky attack shows a contracted gallbladder with multiple small stones in patient who did not eat. Seven days later the gallbladder is deployed again (visualized in again fasting patient). Silent witnesses of a biliary colic in six different patient. US was done 6-12 hours after the pain episode. 
All patients were symptom free at the moment of US. Of course, not all patients are so lucky that their biliary colic spontaneously subsides.  
Of all patients presenting with a biliary colic, in a minority (10-15 %) progression to an acute cholecystitis is seen.
Acute Cholecystitis:
If the stone keeps obstructing the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, bacterial infection of the stagnating bile and mucus may turn an acute hydrops into an acute cholecystitis. Since this a gradual process, the US signs of acute cholecystitis evolve gradually and are superimposed on the signs of acute hydrops In this table the US signs of acute cholecystitis  superimposed on the signs of acute hydrops. The additional US signs of cholecystitis are: Here images of a patient with early acute cholecystitis. 
Note the obstructing stone (arrow), gallbladder wall thickening and bulging of the gallbladder into the abdominal wall during compression, indicating high intraluminal pressure. CRP was 110, confirming the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Advanced cholecystitis with inflamed fat ( asterisks) around the gallbladder fundus.
This represents the omentum, migrating towards the gallbladder in order to wall-off a possible perforation.

These images are of a very ill young lady with diffuse abdominal pain and a CRP of 430. 
US shows massive edematous wall thickening of the gallbladder, which has a small lumen and contains no stones. 
CT reveals lobar nephritis (asterisk) as the cause of the patient’s symptoms and high CRP. 
The gallbladder wall thickening is secondary to the bacterial inflammation. 
After antibiotics, complete normalization of gallbladder and kidneys. Acute pancreatitis simulating acute cholecystitis Here images of an old lady (79 yrs) with acute RUQ pain. Large, however non-hydropic gallbladder (arrowheads) with mobile stones and edematous wall thickening. 
Lab showed CRP 3 and a serum amylase of 985. Diagnosis: biliary pancreatitis with secondary thickening of the gallbladder wall. Acute pancreatitis simulating acute cholecystitis Obese patient with acute epigastric pain. US showed gallstones and wall thickening, suggestive for acute cholecystitis. Subsequent CT revealed the true nature of the symptoms: acute biliary pancreatitis with secondary gallbladder wall thickening. Here a patient with malaise, RUQ-pain and severe liver function abnormalities. US shows small gallbladder with layered wall thickening and enlarged periportal lymph nodes. Diagnosis: acute hepatitis A.
Differentiation Hydrops - Acute Cholecystitis:
More important than the additional US signs in the differentiation of hydrops versus cholecystitis, are the clinical signs and laboratory findings: fever and elevated infection parameters. It must be stressed that especially in the elderly the development from acute hydrops into acute cholecystitis is insidious and often subclinical. The pain is often much less that the original colicky attack and fever is often absent. 
This underlines the important role of repeated CRP. 
Elevation of the CRP –in general- precedes the clinical symptoms. If the patient presents late, the gallbladder may show impressive morphological changes. 
Somewhat confusing may be the fact that in advanced cholecystitis, there can be a less prominent US-hydrops sign, because the diseased wall is not capable of producing mucus anymore and the intraluminal pressure has decreased. The images show a longstanding acute cholecystitis. Note the large area of inflamed and indurated fat (asterisks) and the relatively small, somewhat compressible gallbladder. 
This reflects a lumen filled with pus where the diseased mucosa is not capable of producing mucus under pressure anymore. Drainage revealed pus.
CT in acute cholecystitis:
CT can be very helpful in cases with a non-diagnostic US.
These images are of an obese patient with acute RUQ pain for 6 hours. CRP 2 . US shows a large gallbladder with sludge, no stones were visualized. 
Compression of the gallbladder is unreliable due to the high position under the right costal arch. 
No other US abnormalities. CT, performed the same day, shows a large gallbladder with only discrete pericholecystic changes and no other explanation for the symptoms. 
The next day CRP is 105 and repeated non-contrast CT  shows a fuzzy corona around the gallbladder. Subsequent surgery confirmed early acute cholecystitis due to a small stone in the cystic duct.
Special forms of cholecystitis:
Emphysematous cholecystitis. US shows air in the gallbladder fundus (arrowheads). CT confirms both intraluminal and intramural air.
Emphysematous cholecystitis:
This special form of cholecystitis is usually –but not always- found in older diabetics and has characteristic US and CT features (fig). Because the air indicates wall necrosis, acute cholecystectomy is usually advised, but successful percutaneous drainage is a good alternative, because surgery is often very risky in these diabetic and often otherwise severely compromised patients. These images are of a non-diabetic patient with severe pain RUQ, CRP 190 and WBC of 19.  
US noted weird aspect of the gallbladder with hyperechoic sludge and bright reflections in the wall.
CT showed emphysematous cholecystitis with also free air in the peritoneal cavity. Conventional cholecystectomy revealed necrotizing cholecystitis with peritoneal contamination. Hemorrhagic cholecystitis. US only shows a sludge-like mass. CT scan demonstrates hyperdense blood within the lumen and an irregular wall. Cholecystectomy was technically very difficult.
Hemorrhagic cholecystitis:
Hemorrhagic cholecystitis  is rare and seen when gallbladder wall necrosis has led to intraluminal bleeding 
It is more frequent in patients with anticoagulant therapy. US is usually aspecific but may show a large mass of sludge-like material and an irregular wall. 
CT shows hyperdense, non-attenuating masses within the gallbladder lumen (fig). Since hemorrhage is the result of ischemic necrosis of the gallbladder wall, this should preferably not be treated with percutaneous drainage, although cholecystectomy may also be quite difficult. This is another hemorrhagic cholecystitis in a patient on salicylates. 
The CRP was 150. Immediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done.
The ydrops was confirmed and peroperative puncture revealed blood. The surgery was complicated by a large post-operative hematoma. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis.
Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis:
This is a rare, but well recognized benign form of protracted cholecystitis.
It is possibly the result of multiple episodes of destructive inflammation due to the presence of stones. It is important not to misdiagnose this entity as malignancy. These images are of a 82 year old female, who woke up at four o'clock in the morning with excruciating pain in the upper abdomen. Her lab-findings at admission (8 hours after the pain started) were normal. 
US showed a large but non-hydropic gallbladder with one little stone. 
No obstructing stone was seen. 
There was some free fluid, which at puncture turned out to be bile. 
CT was done but did not yield extra information. 
At laparoscopic cholecystectomy free perforation was found with 150 ml of bile intra-abdominally. Another free perforated cholecystitis.
The decompressed gallbladder has a relatively small lumen and  shows an irregular and edematous wall. There is free intra-peritoneal fluid around the uterus, which at US guided puncture is identified as bile. Ill patient with pain RUQ since 4 days, CRP 450 and leuko 14. CT shows local perforation at the fundus with a not well-defined fluid-collection under the left liver lobe. Immediate open cholecystectomy revealed perforated cholecystitis and severe purulent contamination of the peritoneal cavity. If not timely operated, free perforation may eventually lead to distant abscess formation, often with a different location and aspect than the pericholecystic abscesses from complicated cholecystitis (fig). There is a pericholecystic abscess as well as a distant, perihepatic abscess in perforated cholecystitis. Antibiotics were given and only the gallbladder was drained. Abscess in the liver adjacent to the gallbladder in acute cholecystitis, visible on both US and CT. Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder was done.
The abscess drained itself into the gallbladder lumen.
Cholecystitis mimicking malignancy:
Acute cholecystitis sometimes is not recognized clinically, especially in the elderly, and may then be treated with antibiotics more than once. 
This may cause mitigation and alteration of the normal inflammatory process leading to unusual US and CT findings.  
In such cases not infrequently the diagnosis of gallbladder malignancy is suggested which may lead to ill-advised major surgery. 
Keep in mind that gallbladder carcinoma in the Western world is very rare, is usually inoperable at presentation and has a poor prognosis anyway.  
The combination of clinical history, US and CT image, and the follow-up in time, can prevent unnecessary major surgery.
Acalculous cholecystitis:
Acalculous cholecystitis is a confusing entity. 
True acalculous, non-obstructive  cholecystitis is extremely rare and is the result of primary ischemic necrosis of the gallbladder due to an episode of low-flow state, comparable with non-obstructive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) leading to small bowel infarction. 
It is often seen in older patients with other debilitating disease or after severe trauma.
The treatment is acute cholecystectomy. Most patients diagnosed as “acalculous cholecystitis” are in fact patients with acute hydrops or cholecystitis in whom no stones can be found by US or CT, and also not at operation or in the pathological specimen.
However, when US unequivocally demonstrates hydrops in a patient, it is clear that there must be some sort of luminal obstruction, probably due to a very small stone or some sludge in combination with a narrow cystic duct. 
Because of the obstructive origin, these  cases have the same risk of complications as acute calculous cholecystitis and should thus be treated the same. Another confusing and frequent pitfall is the large gallbladder filled with sludge and a thickened wall, often found in patients in the ICU.
In case of a high CRP, this is often misdiagnosed and mistreated as acalculous cholecystitis.
To avoid this pitfall, it is essential to test US compressibility of the gallbladder fundus and to perform CT to detect possible alternative explanations for the symptoms and the high CRP.
Fistula formation:
Acute cholecystitis can be complicated by perforation.
Most cases of perforated cholecystitis progress slowly and perforation is walled-off with local abscess formation. 
Free perforation in acute cholecystitis is quite rare (as we discussed earlier). Undiagnosed or untreated cholecystitis may also lead to fistula formation to the duodenum.
This is an uncommon complication, but when it occurs, most frequently there is passage of the stone to the small bowel, where it gets stuck and causes a gallstone ileus. In rare cases of duodenal fistulisation, a large gallstone may get “stuck” at the fistula to the duodenum. 
Due to secondary inflammatory and fibrous tissue, this may eventually lead to stenosis and obstruction.
This special situation is called “Bouveret syndrome”  and its main clinical feature is gastric outlet obstruction.
Gallstone ileus:
When untreated, acute cholecystitis may lead to new complications. 
Purulent gallbladder contents including the gallstones may eventually evacuate to the duodenum or sometimes to the colon This occurs usually in older patients, in whom cholecystitis often has remained undiagnosed and/or untreated. 
It usually concerns a large stone, which classically gets stuck  at the ileocecal valve, but in fact in most cases the stone obstructs the small bowel higher up in the ileum or even jejunum. 
The diagnosis in most cases is much easier made using CT than US. Play the video. The key finding is the air in the gallbladder. Play the video. The key finding is the air in the gallbladder. Enable Scroll

Bouveret syndrome:
In rare cases of duodenal fistulisation, a large gallstone may get “stuck” during a longstanding fistulisation process. 
Due to secondary inflammatory and fibrous tissue, this may eventually lead to stenosis and obstruction of the duodenum. This special situation is called “Bouveret syndrome”  and its main clinical feature is gastric outlet obstruction (fig). Although rare, it is very important to make the correct diagnosis, because cholecystectomy is very dangerous and should be avoided. 
If the stone cannot be removed endoscopically, the best solution is a gastrojejunostomy. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Bouveret syndrome CT confirms the diagnosis of Bouveret syndrome. Percutaneous gallbladder drainage relieved the symptoms of gastric retention. One year later, the stone apparently managed to evacuate to the duodenal lumen, and she developed a classic gallstone-ileus as yet, which was operated successfully.
Fistula to the colon:
This rare situation  often  develops subclinically and insidiously. In purulent cholecystitis the pus evacuates to the colon, however evacuation of the stones may take months or even years. 
Patients eventually may develop chronic diarrhoea due to bile irritation. In june 2009 this patient presented with longstanding cholecystitis with two large stones. 
Severe local colonic wall thickening with small intramural abscesses reflect the impending fistulisation process. 
The patient was treated conservatively and in september 2009 she was symptomfree. 
One of the stones and the pus had evacuated to the colon. 
Two years later, also the second stone did evacuate subclinically. A persistent open fistulous tract between gallbladder and right colon was demonstrated on CT and at ERCP. On CT the tract is seen (yellow arrow) and there is air in the galbladder. On ERCP the contrast is injected in the bile ducts and fills the gallbladder through the cystic duct and finally also the right colon.

Vascular Anomalies of Aorta, Pulmonary and Systemic vessels:
Marilyn J. Siegel and Robin Smithuis
Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, USA and the Rijnland Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2007-11-01 This review is based on a presentation by Marilyn Siegel and was adapted and illustrated for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Marilyn Siegel is specialized in pediatric and chest radiology. The second edition of her book entitled Pediatric Body CT will be out next week. In this review we will discuss the most common vascular anomalies of the aorta, pulmonary vessels and systemic veins in the chest. Most of these anomalies are found in children, but sometimes they are discovered later in adulthood. Many of these anomalies are asymptomatic or 'leave alone' lesions, but some of these anomalies are symptomatic and need to be treated. As a radiologist we have to be familiar with these anomalies. A simple mouse click on an item on the left will bring you directly to this subject.
Overview of Arch Anomalies:
Not a true ring. Usually asymptomatic. Sometimes dysphagia lusoria when dilated suvclavian artery compresses esophagus posteriorly.
2. Innominate artery compression syndrome In children the brachiocephalic (innominate) artery is located more to the left and may compresses the trachea anteriorly.
3. Right Arch Mirror ImageMirror-image variety of the left arch. Asymptomatic. Associated congenital heart disease in 98%, mostly tetralogy of Fallot.
4. Right Arch with Aberrant left subclavianLeft subclavian artery is the last branch. Obstructing anomaly.
5. Double Aortic ArchComplete ring encircles esophagus and trachea. Four vessel sign.
6. Double Arch with Atretic SegmentLeft arch is very small and has atretic posterior segment.Still a four vessel sign.
Embryology:
- Double Arch: - Double Arch with Atretic Segment: - Normal Left Arch: - Right Arch with mirror branching: - Left Arch with aberrant right subclavian artery: - Right Arch with aberrant left subclavian artery: When you look at these illustrations, you have to realize, that these are views from above, while CT-images have a 'view from feet'. On a CT-image the ascending aorta will be on the upper part of the image and the descending aorta will be on the lower part.
Aortic Arch Anomalies:
Axial image and volume rendering posterior view
Right Arch Mirror Image:
This is the mirror-image variety of the left arch. On the left a 2 year old girl with wheezing and coughing. Study the images and then continue. You have to realize, that axial CT-images are viewed from the feet, while the illustrations above are viewed from above On the axial image there is a right arch On the volume rendered image there is mirror image branching of the brachiocephalic arteries, no aberrant subclavian artery, so this is a right arch mirror image. Mirror image aortic arch (yellow arrow) and a VSD (red arrow) This anomaly is asymptomatic, because there is no obstructing ring. Almost all of these patients however come to our attention because they have associated congenital heart disease in 98% of cases. This patient had a mirror image aortic arch and a VSD. Mirror image aortic arch in patient operated for tetralogy of Fallot. On the left an adult who was operated in his childhood for a Tetralogy of Fallot (pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, VSD, overriding aorta). At surgery the VSD was patched and the pulmonary outflow tract was enlarged. Notice that there is also a right arch. In the United States there are now more than one million adults who have survived their congenital heart disease. In the ER you will see these patients because they age and get chest pain like many adults do and so you will see these anomalies more frequently. View from anterior
Right Arch with Aberrant left subclavian:
The Right Aortic Arch with an aberrant left subclavian is an obstructing arch anomaly. The first branch of the aorta is the left common carotid, followed by the right subclavian artery and the left common carotid. This also is a true ring. The ligamentum ductus arteriosus between the arch at the level of the left subclavian artery and the left pumonary artery completes the ring. If this ligament is very short, there will be a lot of compression. Enable Scroll

Scroll through the images on the left. Again you have to realize that the axial CT-images have a 'view from feet'. Which vessels are indicated by the yellow and green arrow? There is a right arch and the left subclavian artery is the last branch of the aortic arch, indicating that this is an aberrant left subclavian. Medially to the left subclavian artery we see the left common carotid, that originates from the right side and has an oblique course to the left. The yellow arrow indicates the azygos vein. The green arrow indicates the left superior intercostal vein, a normal variant, that we will discuss later. Posterior oblique view: Right Arch with Aberrant left subclavian (yellow arrow) Same patient. Posterior oblique view of volume rendered image to show the aberrant left subclavian artery. In a mirror type right arch, the left subclavian is the first brach and forms the left innominate together with the left common carotid. Right Arch with Aberrant left subclavian On the left images of a symptomatic child. On the axial image there is a right arch with the left subclavian artery that comes off on the posterior side and runs behind the trachea and the esophagus. The compression of the trachea is demonstrated on the volume rendered view.
Double Aortic Arch:
On the left a chest film of a 6-month old boy with stridor and cough. The trachea is deviated to the left, otherwise the chest film is normal. So there is some mass effect on the right side. On the left the reconstructions demonstrating a double aortic arch. There are branches coming off the right arch and branches coming off the left arch. Double Aortic Arch The right arch is typically larger and higher than the left. There is a complete ring that encircles the esophagus and the trachea and usually there is stridor or dysphagia. Two brachiocephalic arteries arise on each side separately (four vessel sign). On the left a chest film of a young adult with a cough. There is a right paratracheal mass. The differential diagnosis is tumor, adenopathy or vessel (right arch, dilated azygos vein, dilated aberrant right subclavian artery). On the left axial images and posterior view of volume rendered reconstruction. Describe the findings and then continue. The findings are: The narrowing of the trachea is seen on the axial images, but better appreciated on the MPR and Volume Rendered image.

Chu (4) On the left preoperative and postoperative MDCT studies of a 2-month-old female infant with double aortic arch presenting with stridor and repeated apnea. The smaller left arch is partially resected. Double Arch with Atretic Segment Occasionally the double arch can have an atretic segment. You should not confuse it for a right arch. The left arch is just very small and there is still a four vessel sign. Double Arch with Atretic Segment On the left a dominant right arch and a small left arch. The atretic segment is marked by the arrow. Notice the four vessel sign. On a posterior view the interruption is nicely demonstrated. Remember that there is still a ring, so there is still obstruction. Another case on the left. Do not call this a right arch. It still is a double arch and there is a atretic fibrotic segment on the posterior side of the left arch, that completes the ring. Notice the four vessel sign. Same patient. Always look at the airways. On the recoonstruction the impression on the trachea is better appreciated. Aberrant Right SCA, no compression of the trachea
Left Arch Aberrant Right SCA:
On the left a young patient, who has a CT for another reason. Study the images and then continue. Notice that there is a left arch, but the right subclavian artery is the last brachiocephalic artery to branch off the arch. Dysphagia lusoria in patient with dilated aberrant right subclavian artery. Only rarely these patients become dysphagic (dysphagia lusoria) , when the origin of the right subclavian artery becomes dilated. On a barium study of the esophagus you will see a posterior impression with an oblique course directed towards the right shoulder. On the left a 78 year old woman with dysphagia. There is consolidation in the right upper lobe, maybe due to aspiration. There is a dilated vessel that compresses the esophagus and it originates from the left-sided aorta, i.e. an aberrant right subclavian artery.

Innominate artery compression syndrome with compression of the trachea
Innominate artery compression syndrome:
On the left a sagittal scanogram, axial image and sagittal reconstruction of a 5 year old girl with noisy breathing and occasional episodes of cyanosis. First look at the images then continue. The findings are: The diagnosis is the innominate artery compression syndrome. In infants the innominate artery arises more to the left than in adults, so it's got to go in front of the trachea.
It may compress the trachea, leading to stridor, cough and dyspnea.
This compression decreases with age and these patients will outgrow it. The compression in the innominate artery compression syndrome is located on the right anterior side and at the level of the thoracic inlet. This is much higher than in the double arch or Right Aortic Arch with Aberrant left subclavian On the left another case with mild compression on the trachea.
Aortic Coarctation:
On the left a 2 month old boy with heart failure. First study the image, then continue The findings are: The diagnosis is coarctation, which is nicely demonstrated on the posterior view of the reconstruction. There are two types of coarctation. The type we usually see is the post-ductal type, which is distal to the left subclavian artery. The uncommon pre-ductal type is seen in neonates. They present with severe heart failure, mostly within the first week of life, usually on the first day. The occlusion is in front of the left subclavian. First study the axial image followed by the sagittal reconstruction, then continue. The findings are: Intercostal collaterals in aortic coarctation The intercostal collaterals typically occur between the 3rd and the 8th rib. Pre-ductal type of coarctation On the left two neonates with the pre-ductal type of coarctation. The stenosis is in front of the left subclavia and there is arch hypoplasia. Collaterals do not occur, probably because they don't have time to develop. Coarctation treated with angioplasty (left) and stent placement (right) Coarctation is treated with angioplasty, stent placement or patch aortoplasty. The image on the far left is the result after angioplasty. Next to it a patient who was treated with a stent. Notice that the stent is obstructing the orfice of the left subclavian artery. Pseudo-aneurysm in coarctation treated with stent-placement On the far left a patient who was treated with a stent. The stent ruptured causing restenosis. Next to it two patients with pseudo-aneurysm. One after angioplasty and another who developed a pseudo-aneurysm after stent placement. They have to be repaired because they will rupture. Pseudo-aneurysms are seen in
Pulmonary arterial anomalies:
They most common anomalies of the pulmonary arteries are listed in the table on the left. Pulmonary agenesis on the right side
Pulmonary agenesis:
On the left a young adult, who had cyanotic spells as a child. She is now in good health and comes in for another reason. On the chest film the differential is atelectasis, pneumonia or maybe a tumor. The CT shows, that he right lung is not developed and the space around the atresic pulmonary artery is filled with fibrofatty tissue with collaterals. So this is pulmonary agenesis. If many collaterals develop there will also be some development of the lung. Pulmonary agenesis on the left side On the left another case of absent pulmonary artery with absence of lung development. On the CT the left lung is absent. These patients may be totally asymptomatic. Pulmonary Sling
Pulmonary Sling:
On the left a 4 month old girl with abnormal echo, benign heart murmur and no respiratory or feeding difficulties. The sagittal reconstruction shows an anomalous vessel on the posterior side of the trachea. There is a little mass effect on the trachea. Pulmonary Sling In pulmonary sling the left PA originates from the right PA and courses between the esophagus and the trachea, where it compresses the right main bronchus. Pulmonary sling is seen more frequent in children as it is more symptomatic than in adults, because the chest is smaller, but you can also encounter it in adults. Pulmonary Sling with long segment stenosis of the trachea. (Courtesy J. Schoef) On the left images of a child with wheezing and dyspnea. The left PA comes off the right PA and runs between the esophagus (with nasogastric tube) and the trachea. Some of these patients also have long segment stenosis in the trachea because of cartilagenous rings. Patent Ductus Arteriosus
Patent Ductus Arteriosus:
On the left an adolescent with a murmur. On axial image and reconstruction the patent ductus arteriosus is seen. The ductus arteriosus is the communication between the pulmonary artery and the proximal descending aorta. It shunts blood in utero from the right ventricle to the aorta to bypass the non-functioning lungs. On the first day of life there is a functional closure and an anatomic closure with fibrosis in the first two weeks. If it does not close these patients come to attention either with a murmur or later with pulmonary hypertension. On the left a young adult with a murmur. The cardiologists are not interested in the flow direction, but just want to confirm the diagnosis. Notice the connection between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta. When the duct closes it may also calcify. This a normal variant.
Pulmonary venous anomalies:

Partial Anomalous Venous Return:
The most common features of Partial Anomalous Venous Return are listed in the table on the left. The anomalous veins drain into the following structures: Right upper lobe anomalous vein drains into the superior vena cava. Right upper lobe anomalous venous return
On the left a 2 month old, who is asymptomatic but has a murmur on physical examination. There is a connection between the SVC and a pulmonary vein, so this is an anomalous venous return. Pulmonary hypertension in a patient with partially anomalous pulmonary venous return. All these partially anomalous pulmonary venous returns are left to right shunts, but when small, they are clinically insignificant. When there is a significant shunt, they may cause (late) pulmonary hypertension as seen in the case on the left. The chest film in this adult shows large pulmonary arteries and a large right atrium and ventricle as a result of pulmonary hypertension. Right upper lobe anomalous return (2) On the left a patient with a murmur. Study the images and then continue. On the left a similar case. Notice the anomalous return of the right upper lobe vein into the VCS and the additional ASD at a lower level. Right lower lobe anomalous return On the left a right lower lobe anomalous return. The vein drains into the IVC. The anomalous vein gently curves to the right cardiophrenic angle and is shaped like a Turkish sword ('Scimitar') Right lower lobe anomalous venous return into the azygos vein. On the left another right lower lobe anomalous return. The vein drains into the azygos vein. Upper lobe veins may also drain into the azygos vein. On the left a 10 year old girl suspected of having pneumonia. Study the images carefully, because there are three findings and then continue reading. The findings are: This patient has a scimitar syndrome and also a right arch. So the lesson is, that when you see one anomaly, look for another one.
Scimitar syndrome:
The features in scimitar syndrome are listed in the table on the left. Scimitar syndrome with a hypoplastic right lung. On the left another patient with a scimitar syndrome. There is a hypoplastic right lung with mediastinal shift and there is anomalous venous return. Notice that on the coronal MIP you can nicely see the difference in vascularization of the lungs with hypovascularity on the right. Enable Scroll

Left Superior Intercostal Vein
Left Superior Intercostal Vein.:
This is an anastomosis between the accessory hemiazygos vein and the left brachiocephalic vein. It courses along the lateral margin of the aortic arch ('aortic nipple'). It is a normal variant and if you look for this structure you will frequently notice it. Catheters or pacemaker leads may course along left side of mediastinum. On the left a patient with a left superior intercostal vein. Notice the 'aortic nipple sign'. Left Superior Intercostal Vein On the left another example of a left superior intercostal vein. It courses along the lateral margin of the aortic arch from the the accessory hemiazygos vein to the left brachiocephalic vein. Summary of left paramediastinal structures
Azygos Continuation of IVC:

Technique and Protocol:
Ideally a 64 slice scanner is used, but even a 4-slice scanner will suffice for studying vascular anomalies. The technique for these anomalies in the chest is the same as we use for pulmonary embolus detection. Thin collimation is used in combination with a fast table speed in order to get the highest resolution with the lowest radiation exposure. Usually a pitch of 1.5 is used. In children we preferably do not use thin collimation, because of the higher radiation exposure, but these anomalies can be very small (voorbeeld dia 18), so thin collimation is necessary. mAs and kVp In a child with a weight of less than 10Kg 40mAs will work in the chest. In children with a weight more than 45 Kg adult protocols are used with 100 mAs or more. In small children under 50 kg you can decrease the kVp to 80 and that works very well in the chest. Remember in the chest there is inherent contrast from the lungs and by dropping the kVp you enhance this contrast. On the left a 3-year old. Non-breath hold images with 50mAs and 80 kVp on a 16 row detector.
Although the axial images are a little bit grainy, the reconstructions are just fine. Do these patients need sedation?
Well most of the time they don't. If you can get the patient on the table and they are relatively still, even if they are breathing, you will get good studies. If you can't get the patient on the table, because they prefer the floor, you've got to sedate. In about 20-25% of pediatric studies we use sedation. If the catheter is not in the antecubital vein, hand injection is preferred. Scan Initiation Time Bolus tracking is used and the trigger is set at 120 HU. This may not always work, because in small children the amount of contast may be too small to trigger or due to breathing the cursor may fall to the lungs. If bolus tracking does not trigger, start the scan at 15 seconds. Positioning the ROI Coronal MPR (left), external volume rendering (middle) and internal volume rendering. Post-processing Multiplanar reconstructions (MPR), volume rendered techniques (VRT) and maximum intensity (MIP) are very helpful. There is no role for shaded surface or mini-IP's. On the left an external and internal rendering which provides in contrast to MPR real 3D information. In volume rendering the posterior view is preferred to get a good look at the arch and descending aorta. Thick slab maximal intensity projection to study the pulmonary vasculature. If you want to study peripheral vessels you will need thick slab maximal intensity projections. For instance if you study arteriovenous malformations or discrepancy in lung flow. Thick slab coronal maximal intensity projection image in patient with scimitar syndrome.

High grade coarctation of aorta not seen on axial images but clearly visualized on sagittal MPR. 3D reconstructions are helpful when there are short focal lesions like coarctation or when vessels course obliquely (figure). Adding 3D reconstructions to axial images will increase the sensitivity from 90% to 100% (Lee, Siegel AJR 182:777-784 ) On the left a 17-day old boy with minimal cyanosis, mild heart failure and upper extremity hypertension.

Pancreatic Cancer - CT staging 2.0:

Assessment of Resectability:
Frank Wessels, Otto van Delden and Robin Smithuis
From the Radiology Department of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Amsterdam University Medical Centre and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp:
Publicationdate 2021-08-01 This is the second version of the role of CT in staging pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth largest cause of cancer death in the United States and Europe with over 100,000 deaths per year in Europe alone.
The overall 5-year survival ranges from 2–7 % and has hardly improved over the last two decades.
Approximately 15 % of all patients have presumed resectable disease at diagnosis and of those, only a subgroup has a resectable tumor at surgical exploration. In this article we will focus on the criteria for resectability versus irresectability and we will provide a checklist that will help you to make a structured report for staging pancreatic cancer and determining resectability. At the end of the article there will be videos by Frank Wessels on how to stage pancreatic cancer.
Introduction:
Complete resection of the tumor is the only curative treatment, but pancreatic cancer is seldom detected at an early stage, as 40% of patients present with distant metastases and 40% present with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), which is unresectable. When there are no distant metastases, the resectability mainly depends on the local status determined by: These subjects will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter on staging. 
Based on the imaging findings the tumor can be categorized as resectable, borderline resectable or unresectable.
Staging:

Assessment of vascular involvement:
Involvement of critical vascular structures is the most important factor, which determines the resectability of a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (figure).
At the same time it is an important predictor of survival. The most commonly used resectability criteria for vascular involvement are the criteria of the  National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). These criteria however are quite complex and that is why several other criteria exist.
For instance in the Netherlands we use the criteria of the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group (DPCG). We will first discuss the DPCG criteria followed by the NCCN criteria. Whatever criteria you use, you need to realize that assessment of resectability can be subjective and varies between institutions, especially in the case of portovenous reconstructions.
DPCG resectability criteria:
The criteria of the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group for vascular compromise are relatively simple compared to the NCCN criteria and that is why we present these criteria first (table). The resectability is also determined by the presence of distant metastases and the lymph node status in which extraregional lymph nodes are regarded as distant metastases. Important additional findings of interest to the surgeon, that are easily overlooked are: These findings will be discussed in the next chapter.
NCCN resectability criteria:
Locally irresectable is synonym to locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Assessing the degree of circumferential vascular involvement is done in 90 degree steps.
Less than 180 degrees contact is called abutment and more than 180 degrees contact is called encasement. The probability of vascular invasion is 40% for abutment and 80% for encasement, up to 100% when the tumor is completely surrounding the portal vein or SMV. In case of venous involvement the length of invasion is also mentioned as this may guide the surgeon in assessing the possibility of reconstruction. The specificity of CT for detecting vascular invasion ranges from 82-100% and sensitivity from 70-96%. The use of multiplanar reformations improves overall CT performance as seen in this case. A coronal reformat shows a small tumor in the pancreatic head (arrowheads) with obstruction of the common bile duct. There seems to be just limited contact with the portal vein (arrow).
Continue with the next images. A multiplanar reformat perpendicular to the portal vein shows that there is more extensive contact with the portal vein, 90 – 180 degrees (arrow). Without contour irregularity this is classified as borderline resectable according to the DPCG criteria but resectable according to the NCCN criteria. Resection without venous reconstruction proved to be R1, meaning presence of microscopic tumor invasion of the resection margin. Teardrop sign. A large tumor in the body of the pancreas, 90 – 180 degrees contact with the SMV, but moreover deformation of the SMV into a so called teardrop, highly suspicious for invasion.

There is encasement of the celiac artery for 360º degrees (arrow in A). The axial MIP at the level of the celiac artery shows narrowing of the encased common hepatic artery (arrow), highly suspicious for invasion.
Location:
65% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas are located within the head, 15% in the corpus and 10% in the tail. The remaining 10% being multifocal or diffuse (figure). Tumors of the head usually present earlier due to obstructive jaundice. Tumors of the body and tail tend to present late and they are associated with a worse prognosis.
T-stage:
T-staging has been simplified in the AJCC TNM-8 criteria. The T-stage does not determine whether a tumor ia resectable or not, but has merely prognostic implications. T2 and T3 categories are now based on size only and extrapancreatic extension is no longer part of the definition.
The rationale being that size-based definitions are more objective as it is difficult to determine extrapancreatic extension. T4 categorization is now based on involvement of the arteries.
Resectability has been removed from the definition as resectability can be subjective and variable between institutions.
N-stage:
It is important to discriminate between regional lymph nodes and extra regional lymph nodes (distant metastases).
The main extraregional locations are para-aortic and to the left of the SMA. Suspicious nodes in these locations should be documented and sampled. In this illustration we use the lymph node stations in pancreatic carcinoma as proposed by the Japan Pancreas Society.
A complete list is provided in the chapter on reporting. Click here. Lymph node metastases are an important prognostic factor and occur in approximately two-thirds of patients with otherwise resectable pancreatic cancer. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images for the location of the lymph node stations in the axial plane. The sensitivity of CT for detecting lymph node metastases is poor, around 15% based on a size criterium of >10mm short-axis alone. The reason for this poor sensitivity is that small regional lymph nodes often harbor metastases, while large lymph nodes can be reactive. Adding morphological features like rounded shape, heterogeneity, central necrosis and absence of fatty hilum, still results in a poor sensitivity with values no greater than 30%. Axial CT (a) shows multipele para-aortic lymph nodes, up to a short-axis of 10mm (primary tumor in the pancreas not shown). CT guided biopsy of a low left para-aortic lymph node was performed. Pathological analysis showed no metastasis but sarcoid. This patient had a primary tumor in the head of the pancreas (not shown).
There is a locoregional lymph node metastasis next to the portal vein (arrowhead).
A second lymph node metastasis is seen between the caudate lobe and left gastric artery (arrow). This second lymph node metastasis is not routinely resected but may be part of an extended lymhadenectomy. Continue with next image... In
the chest a similar pathological lymph node was seen para-esophageal in station
8. This
was confirmed on EUS guided FNA as an extraregional lymph node
metastasis. Meaning distant metastases and irresectabele disease. Liver metastases shown on DWI but not on CT (arrowheads).
M-stage:
40% of patients with pancreatic cancer have distant metastases at the time of presentation. Next to distant lymph node metastases these are mainly hepatic (20-75%), peritoneal (9%) and pulmonary (<10%). Liver metastases frequently present as multiple lesions less than 10mm in size and are predominantly in a subcapsular location. It has been hypothesized that this is a form of peritoneal spread. Subsequently the sensitivity of CT for detecting liver metastases is low, around 75%. Furthermore over 50% of hepatic metastases are diagnosed within 6 months of resection of the primary tumor, suggesting synchronous disease and being already present at the time of initial staging. Images
The images show an axial CT (a,b) with a resectable tumor in the pancreatic head, with no signs of liver metastases.
The patient was randomized for neaoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the PREOPANC-2 trial.
MRI for radiotherapyplanning (DWI shown in c,d) within several weeks of CT showed over 10 liver metastases. CT
is not sensitive for the detection of small peritoneal lesions, but larger
lesions may be noted. ImagesPeritoneal
metastases in the right paracolic gutter (arrowhead) and in the rectovesical
space (arrow) in a patient with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (not shown).
In the presence of distant metastases curative intended treatment of LAPC (systemic
therapy with possible subsequent resection) is no longer an option. In
doubtful cases laparoscopy may confirm the diagnosis.
Additional findings of interest to the surgeon:
Next to the assessment of vascular involvement the invasion of other
surrounding structures and organs should be examined (see checklist). Some
of which are directly invaded and don’t
preclude resection (for instance duodenal invasion, which is taken out in a
Whipple procedure.)
But both spread to the
transverse mesocolon and root of the mesentery are commonly overlooked and may
warrant extended resections or lead to irresectability.
Perineural invasion:
Perineural spread is a common finding in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and seen in more than half of the cases.
It is an important prognostic factor for early recurrence and metastatic disease. On CT it is detected as infiltrating soft tissue from the edge of the tumor along known specific peripancreatic neural pathways, which extend from the pancreatic head to the SMA, celiac trunc and the common hepatic artery. Even in small tumors this can lead to unresectable disease. Perineural invasion (2)
The axial image shows a double duct sign (arrowheads).
Although a mass in the pancreatic head is not seen, we must assume that there is a small tumor in the pancreatic head. On both the axial and coronal images there is extensive soft tissue infiltration from the medial side of the pancreatic head toward the SMA (yellow arrows). This is a typical pattern of perineural growth.
In this case leading to 90 – 180 degrees contact with the SMA. Continue with the scroll images... Enable Scroll

The coronal reformat shows invasion of the mesentery as demonstrated by encasement of a major SMV tributary (arrowhead) and separate obstruction of proximal jejunal veins (arrow)
Spread to root of mesentery:
The root of the small bowel mesentery
extends obliquely in the abdomen running from the point of termination of the duodenum at Treitz all the way to the cecum. The
SMA and the SMV and their branches are the predominant vascular structures within the mesentery. A carcinoma of
the uncinate process can easily involve the jejunal mesentery by spreading
along this pathway. 
The first jejunal branches of the SMA and SMV serve as landmarks
to identify this type of invasion (figure). If invasion is limited
resection and reconstruction may be possible, but more extensive invasion is
mostly irresectable. Axial CT shows a mass in the pancreatic head (arrowhead). In less then 90 degrees contact with the SMV (arrow), but also in close contact to the gastrocolic trunk (asterisk), in this case the venous confluence of the right gastopepiploic vein (RGEV) and the middle colic vein (MCV).
Spread to transverse mesocolon:
The
transverse mesocolon is in contact with the ventral side of the head of the
pancreas and can be invaded by a tumor of the pancreatic head. It
can be identified on CT by following the middle colic vein and right
gastro-epiloic vein to the point where they join to form the gastrocolic trunk,
which is usually the last vein to drain into the SMV, on the ventral side. Invasion
of the transverse mesocolon does not necessarily preclude resection, but since additional
hemicolectomy might be needed this is essential pre-operative information.
Variations of arterial anatomy:

Anatomic variations:
What we regard as the normal hepatic arterial anatomy is seen in only 55% of the population (figure). Variations of the hepatic arterial anatomy are seen in approximately 40-45%. Anomalous arteries may run in close proximity to the head of the pancreas, which predisposes them to tumor extension or predisposes them to iatrogenic injury during surgery. Hepatic arteries with an anomalous origin can either be accessory or replaced. An accessory right hepatic artery is an extra right hepatic artery, while a replaced right hepatic artery has an anomalous origin and replaces the proper right hepatic artery (figure).
The most common variations are demonstrated in the illustration. In patients planned for pancreatic surgery, it is important to look especially for an anomalous origin of the right or common hepatic artery. These arteries originate from the right side of the SMA and run in close proximity to the head of the pancreas, which predisposes them to tumor extension or iatrogenic injury. 
The reported frequencies of these specific anomalies are 11-21% and 0.5-5%. Replaced right hepatic artery The axial CT shows a accessory right hepatic artery (yellow arrow) running in close proximity to a hypodense mass in the pancreatic head (arrowhead). The vascular involvement is better appreciated on the sagittal reconstruction. There is 90 – 180° abutment of the replaced right hepatic artery (white arrow) by a pancreatic head adenocarcinoma (white arrowhead). 
The native left hepatic artery is seen in a more anterior course, the portal vein in between. The operation was a R1-resection. Enable Scroll

The hepatic artery is seen within the pancreatic head (yellow and green arrow in B). Celiac trunc stenosis with collateral bloodflow to the hepatic artery via the pancreaticoduodenal arcade.
Arterial stenosis:
Next step in the preoperative evaluation is to look for a stenosis of the celiac artery, which is observed in 2-8% of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. 
Celiac artery stenosis can either be caused by compression of the median arcuate ligament or atherosclerotic disease. A significant stenosis of the celiac artery is usually overcome by collateral bloodflow from the SMA, via the peripancreatic arcade (of Buhler) and retrograde flow in the gastroduodenal artery. Since the gastroduodenal artery is resected during pancreaticoduodenectomy the arterial blood supply to the liver is at risk if a celiac artery stenosis is not detected preoperatively. Images
The coronal reformat (a) shows a small tumor in the ampullary region (arrowhead), with obstruction of both the common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatic duct (PD). In absence of local invasion this is regarded as a resectable lesion. 
The axial CT (b) however shows hypertrophy of the peripancreatic arcade (arrows), highly suggestive of a significant stenosis of the celiac trunk. 
The celiac trunk stenosis is shown on sagittal MIP (arrow in c). 
The collateral bloodflow to the hepatic artery via the pancreaticoduodenal arcade (stippled arrow) is nicely appreciated on a coronal MIP (d).
Re-staging after neoadjuvant treatment:
Follow-up CT after neoadjuvant therapy shows no disease progression and exploration was performed. In the era of neoadjuvant treatment restaging has become a hot topic and has shown some important restrictions, mainly in the differentiation of remaining fibrosis and vital tumor. Re-staging on CT overestimates tumor size and consequently underestimates response, therefore RECIST measurements have little to no value in the absence of progression. Furthermore vascular involvement is overestimated, persisting in 80% of patients, but possibly being fibrosis instead of vital tumor. Any reduction in vessel-tumor contact has been shown to be significantly associated with R0 resection, suggesting that this finding might be considered an indication for surgical resection in suitable candidates. The role of re-staging CT at this time is to rule out disease progression and if so surgical exploration should be considered. Data on the additional value of DWI or PET-CT are still limited. Images
Axial CT (a) before neoadjuvant treatment shows a tumor on the medial side of the pancreatic head (arrowhead), irresectable based on extensive perineural growth with 360 degrees encasement of the SMA (arrow in b, coronal reformat). 
Follow-up CT after 8 cycli of FOLFIRINOX (c,d) shows stable disease with persistent encasement of the SMA. The process was resectable on explorative laparotomy. T3bN2R0 on pathological exam.
Imaging:

CT protocol:
Local staging should be done on a high quality pancreatic CT, consisting of a late arterial and portal venous phase.
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically presents as a hypodense hypovascular mass, which is best appreciated in the late arterial phase. This is also best for the arterial anatomy to look ofr variants and stenoses. The portovenous phase is best for detection of liver metastases and detection of venous stenoses and encasement. For protocol recommendations click here CTis the workhorse in staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
It is most widely used and best validated.
CT can assess local extension and distant metastases, with accuracies of up to 77% for predicting resectability and 93% for predicting irresectability.
Role of MRI:
MRI is used for the characterization of indeterminate liver lesions on CT, as of yet there is no evidence supporting for staging of the liver with MRI in all patients. Furthermore MRI can be used in the characterization of mainly cystic pancreatic lesions, a subject beyond the scope of this article. MRI allows improved detection of liver metastases, with reported sensitivities of 85-100%. With 10-25% of MRI being positive for liver metastases after initial negative CT. These data are however based on small retrospective studies. In the era of neoadjuvant treatment the role of MRI is still debated, given the fact that in >40% of small liver lesions histological proof cannot be obtained via a percutaneous biopsy.
Surgical treatment:
Whipple procedure before and after Whipple procedure
A Whipple procedure is an operation in which the pancreatic head with the carcinoma and the distal choledochal duct is resected combined with a small distal part of the stomach, the duodenum and a small part of the proximal jejunum. 
The stomach, proximal choledochal duct and the body of the pancreas are connected to the jejunum. Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy
A pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) is almost the same operation but the pylorus is preserved. Distal or left pancreatectomy
Operation for a tumor in the pancreatic body or tail. It is carried out with or without splenectomy. Total pancreatectomy

US-guided injection of joints:
James Collins, Robin Smithuis and Matthieu Rutten
Department of Radiology of the Medical Center, Leeuwarden, the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp and the Jeroen Bosch Hospital, 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2012-12-22 This article describes the application of Ultrasound guidance for diagnostic and therapeutic joint injections. Ultrasound is a valuable alternative to procedures performed either blind or under fluoroscopic or CT guidance.
Shoulder:

Glenohumeral joint:
Anterior approach In the anterior approach the patient is lying supine with the extended arm externally rotated (figure). The transducer is placed ventrally parallel to the long axis of the subscapular tendon. The grey line on the side of the transducer indicates the long axis. Local anaesthetics are not needed if needles are used with a diameter of 21-gauge or thinner. For joint aspirations one may need to use a larger bore needle due to high viscosity of the aspirate. In such cases local anaesthetics are indicated. To facilitate injection of medication or contrast, one may use a connection tube in between the needle and the syringe, the latter being held and managed by an assistant. The landmarks one should look for are the medial contour of the humeral head and medial to this the coracoid process (C) A 22-gauge, 50mm needle is used connected to a syringe containing the contrast media, held by an assistant who upon proper needle position injects 15-20 mL of the contrast medium. The needle is advanced perpendicular to the medial edge of the humeral head, penetrating the subscapular tendon. If one hits the cartilage of the humeral head, the needle should be pulled back 1 or 2 mm, slightly angled by about 15◦ and then advanced tangentially to the head into the joint with the bevel of the needle facing into the joint (figure). No resistance to injection should be felt and one should see the contrast flow freely into the joint and if present into the subscapular recess.
Posterior approach:
A. The needle is in the intra-articular position with the tip underneath the infraspinatus tendon (ISP) and posterior labrum (L) and bordering the hyaline cartilage (asterisks) of the humeral head. B. Corresponding cadaver section showing the optimal needle track (white line). C. Sonogram after injection of 15 mL contrast. The correct intra-articular position of the needle can be visualized real-time during injection, but is also confirmed by the 'comma'-like configuration of the posterior labrum (arrowheads), which is lifted by the intraarticularly injected fluid. US-image showing a long axis view of the supraspinatus tendon (SSP). The advancing needle under real-time US-guidance has entered the subacromial bursa between the deltoid and SSP-muscle. Dilatation of the subacromial–subdeltoid bursa after injection of 5 mL fluid (blue arrows).
Subacromial bursa:
The subacromial-subdeltoid bursa is a synovial lined space, which contains no observable or only a minimal amount of fluid. The bursa consists of two bursal leaves. The outer and inner leaves are fused with the deltoid muscle fascia and rotator cuff, respectively. The bursal leaves can easily glide over each other, thus facilitating the range of movement of the shoulder. Blind subacromial injection of drugs into the subacromial bursa is a frequently performed therapy by general practitioners and orthopedic surgeons. The incidence of injections that miss the subacromial bursa range from 12% to 70%.
Elbow:
For injection of the elbow the patient is supine with the arm in 90◦ flexion, raised and resting on a cushion. The joint space between the radial head and the capitulum is easily palpated. The hand is pronated or may be turned into the thumb up position, which is necessary to open the joint maximally. The transducer is placed over the joint visualizing the joint space. The needle (22 gauge, 30 mm) is directed at a slight craniocaudal angle on the dorsolateral side of the joint toward the joint space aiming toward the articular surface of the radial head. When seen to have entered the joint and upon feeling the cartilage of the radial head, the needle is slightly pulled back to ensure that the bevel is free from the cartilage and facing into the joint. 5-8 mL of contrast media is injected. No resistance to injection should be felt.
Wrist and hand:

Radiocarpal joint:
The patient is supine with the wrist resting flexed over a 45◦ sponge or a rolled-up towel. In some cases it may be helpful to hold the wrist in ulnar deviation in order to open the joint space even more. The space between the radius and the scaphoid is identified on ultrasound. A 23-25-gauge, 30 mm needle is advanced under ultrasound guidance into the joint directed toward the articular surface of the radius until one feels contact with the radius. After ensuring that the tip of the needle is free from the radial cartilage 2-4 mL contrast is injected. The bevel of the needle is facing toward the joint space and the contrast is seen to flow into the joint.
Distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ):
A linear array transducer is axially positioned dorsally over the distal radius and ulna. Along the short axis of the transducer a 23-25- gauge, 30 mm needle is inserted being directed from proximally to distally in a caudal direction. A total amount of 0.5-1 mL is injected according to rising pressure during injection.
Carpal, carpometacarpal and interphalangeal joints:
Physicians and specialists routinely perform intra-articular punctures and injections on small wrist and finger joints to relieve joint effusion or to inject drugs. The failure rate and frequency of occurrence of peri-articular injections are high: 15% - 32%, especially with the joints of the little finger and the DIP joints. Unintended peri-articular drug injection moreover may affect the surrounding ligaments or tendons, leading to serious complications. A dorsal approach using a 23-25-gauge needle is preferable. Although high-frequency linear array transducers with frequencies from 18 to 12 MHz are often used for scanning the superficial soft tissue structures of the wrist and hand, a small footprint transducer may allow better access to the small peripheral joints. Generally, 0.5-1 mL of contrast material is instilled after confir- mation of correct needle placement.
Sacroiliac Joint:
The sacroiliac joint has been implicated as a source of low back and lower extremity pain, which is thought to be caused by sacroiliitis. Treatment consists of intra-articular injection of corticosteroids. Diagnostic injections or blocks are frequently performed, to distinguish between the probable causes of low back pain, because in 15-25% this is generated by the SI joint. Upper level SI joint injection The axially orientated transducer is moved from the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra caudally, depicting the dorsal surface of the sacrum with the median and lateral sacral crest, the gluteal surface of the ilium, and the first posterior sacral foramen. The needle is inserted along the short axis of the transducer into the hypoechoic cleft located between the surface of the sacrum and the contour of the ilium. Angulations of needle insertion are adjusted to the orientation of the hypoechoic cleft of the SI joint, which presents cranially a more medial to lateral orientation, and caudally a more vertical orientation. Lower level SI joint injection From the upper level the transducer is moved downward by delineation of the median and lateral sacral crest, at the dorsal surface of the sacrum and the gluteal surface of the ilium until the second posterior sacral foramen is visualized. As with the upper level, the needle is inserted into the hypoechoic cleft between the sacrum and ilium.
Hip:
The patient is placed supine. The leg is held in slight endorotation and abduction thereby reducing tension on the capsular structures and moving the iliopsoas tendon and bursa medially out of the intended needle path.
Preferably a 5-3.5 MHz curved array transducer is used, which provides the necessary penetration depth.
Usually a 21 gauge needle with a length of 9 cm is used for the average adult. In smaller adults or children a 23-gauge, 5 cm hypodermic needle might be used. Local anaesthetic may be injected prior to the main injection but this entails extra manipulation as well as non-contrast fluid (anaesthetic) in the joint leaving less room for the contrast in the limited joint space as well as possibly 2 punctures. The needle may inadvertently be withdrawn from the joint after anaesthetic injection during the switch to connect the syringe with contrast. This could be avoided by using a three-way connector between the two syringes containing the anaesthetic and the injection fluid (contrast or medication).
The needle is advanced at a caudo-cranial angle along the long axis of the transducer aiming for the anterior recess near the junction of the femoral neck with the femoral head (see US and illustration). The bevel of the needle should be facing toward the joint.
When the needle makes contact with the femoral head-neck junction it is slightly retracted to prevent inadvertently injection underneath the synovial fold of the hip joint capsule (see drawing).
If correctly positioned within the joint capsule, 10-15 mL contrast media or medication is injected and the anterior recess will distend by the injected fluid confirming the intra-articular positioning.
Knee:
Indications for CT or MR arthrography of the knee are evaluation of the post-operative meniscus, query intra-articular bodies, evaluation of the stability of osteochondral lesions and evaluation of articular cartilage. One may also be requested to inject medication such as corticosteroids and/or a local anaesthetic. For injection we do not use ultrasound guidance but use the standard "blind" procedure introducing the needle (21-gauge, 50 mm) behind the patella using a lateral midpatellar approach. The patella is lateralized and the needle introduced from the mid lateral side aiming toward the centre of the patella indicated by the left forefinger. The needle is introduced horizontally aiming posterior to the centre of the patella until one makes contact with the lateral patellar facet or the lateral femoral condyle and when felt to be in the joint 40 mL contrast media is injected. Prior to CT or MR one can choose to apply a tight bandage above the patella thereby forcing contrast from the suprapatellar recess into the joint space proper.
Ankle and foot:
The foot is slightly plantar flexed. The long axis of the transducer is indicated by the grey line on the side, being in a sagittal plane.
Tibiotalar joint:
CT or MR arthrography may be used to query ligamentous, osteochondral or chondral injury, eval- uation for free bodies or query stability of ostechondral lesions. For injection of the ankle (tibiotalar joint) the patient is supine with the foot in slight plantar flexion. The medial side of the tibiotalar joint is investigated anteriorly with ultrasound to deter- mine a suitable place for injection, at the same time checking for any excessive joint fluid. We use a small curved array 8 MHz transducer but if preferred one can use an 18-12 MHz linear array transducer. The long axis of the probe is held in a sagittal plane. Sonogram showing the needle (arrow) and the needle tip (arrowhead) and the injected contrast media in the tibiotalar joint. The needle, usually 22-gauge (length: 30 mm), is introduced in line with the long imaging axis of the transducer on the medial side of the anterior joint space, medial to the anterior tibial ligament, avoiding ligaments and vessels. One should identify the talar dome and the overhanging anterior tibial lip. The needle is angled caudo-cranially into the joint under the ventral lip of the distal tibia aiming for the articular surface of the distal tibia. Contact is felt and once again one ensures that the needle tip is free from the tibial cartilage and that the bevel is facing into the joint. 8-10 ml of contrast is injected into the tibiotalar joint and one sees the anterior capsule swells up with the fluid. There should be no resistance to injection or pain experienced by the patient.
Posterior subtalar joint:
The subtalar or talocalcaneal joint is composed of 3 facets: a broad posterior facet representing the primary articulating surface, a medially located middle facet in which the sustentaculum tali articulates with the medial process of the talus, and an anterior facet. Subtalar arthrography may be performed via an anterolat- eral, posterolateral or posteromedial approach. 2-4 ml of contrast material is injected into the posterior subtalar joint. Schematic drawing in a coronal view of the right sinus tarsi. Displayed are the course and attachment sites of the cervical ligament (1); the interosseous talo- calcaneal ligament (2); and the medial (3), intermediate (4), and lateral (5) roots of the inferior extensor retinaculum.
Sinus tarsi:
The sinus tarsi is a cone-shaped cavity that courses in a postero- medial to anterolateral direction. It is located in the lateral aspect of the foot between the neck of the talus and the anterosuperior surface of the calcaneus. The tarsal sinus continues medially as the tarsal canal, which is a funnel-shaped space between the talus and the calcaneus. It contains fat, an arterial anastomosis, joint cap- sules, nerve endings, and five ligamentous structures-the medial, intermediate, and lateral roots of the inferior extensor retinaculum; the cervical ligament; and the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament (figure). This space can be the cause of foot pain in the sinus tarsi syn- drome. The first step in treatment is infiltration of the sinus tarsi with a mixture of Depomedrol and local anaesthetic (Lidocaine). This can be challenging for the surgeon in a non-guided approach but is reasonably easily and accurately achieved with ultrasound guidance. US-guided injection of the sinus tarsi at the right-hand side with a lateral approach. The transducer is held in a coronal oblique plane. The needle is introduced along the long axis of the transducer. The sinus tarsi can easily be visualized using ultrasound. The patient turns onto the contralateral side laying the foot to be treated with its medial surface against the table top, the lateral side of the foot being uppermost. The transducer is held in a coronaloblique plane with regards to the foot. The sinus tarsi is identified as a triangular space between the anterior process of the calcaneus and the talar neck. The tip of the needle (arrow head) is seen within the cone shaped sinus tarsi, which is bordered by the talus (T) and calcaneus (C). Depending on the degree of inflammation there may be hyperemia of the space and there may be intervening vessels visible, which one wishes to avoid. This is relatively easy, especially with colour doppler

Shoulder Anatomy and Variants on MRI:
Robin Smithuis and Henk Jan van der Woude
Radiology department of the Alrijne hospital, Leiderdorp and the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2012-04-02 The glenohumeral joint has a greater range of motion than any other joint in the body. The small size of the glenoid fossa and the relative laxity of the joint capsule renders the joint relatively unstable and prone to subluxation and dislocation. MR is the best imaging modality to examen patients with shoulder pain and instability. In Shoulder MR-Part I we will focus on the normal anatomy and the many anatomical variants that may simulate pathology. In part II we will discuss shoulder instability. In part III we will focus on impingement and rotator cuff tears.
Introduction:
Lateral view of right shoulder The glenohumeral joint has the following supporting structures: Anterior view The tendon of the subscapularis muscle attaches both to the lesser tuberosity aswell as to the greater tuberosity giving support to the long head
of the biceps in the bicipital groove. Dislocation of the long head of the biceps will inevitably result in rupture of part of the subscapularis tendon. The rotator cuff is made of the tendons of subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscle. Posterior view The supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscles and tendons are shown. They all attach to the greater tuberosity. The rotator cuff muscles and tendons act to stabilize the shoulderjoint during movements. Without the rotator cuff, the humeral head would ride up partially out of the glenoid fossa, lessening the efficiency of the deltoid muscle. Large tears of the rotator cuff may allow the humeral head to migrate upwards resulting in a high riding humeral head.

Axial anatomy and checklist:
At this level look for SLAP-lesions and variants like sublabral foramen. At this level also look for Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral margin of the humeral head.
5. The fibers of the subscapularis tendon hold the biceps tendon within its groove. Study the cartilage.
6. At this level study the middle GHL and the anterior labrum. Look for variants like the Buford complex. Study the cartiage.
7. The concavity at the posterolateral margin of the humeral head should not be mistaken for a Hill Sachs, because this is the normal contour at this level.
Hill Sachs lesions are only seen at the level of the coracoid. Anteriorly we are now at the 3-6 o'clock position. This is where the Bankart lesion and variants are seen.
8. Notice the fibers of the inferior GHL. At this level also look for Bankart lesions.
Axis of supraspinous tendon:
The supraspinatus tendon is the most important structure of the rotator cuff and subject to tendinopathy and tears. Tears of the supraspinatus tendon are best seen on coronal oblique and ABER-series. In many cases the axis of the supraspinatus tendon (arrowheads) is rotated more anteriorly compared to the axis of the muscle (yellow arrow). When you plan the coronal oblique series, it is best to focus on the axis of the supraspinatus tendon. Enable Scroll

ABER view:
Labral tears The abduction external rotation (ABER) view is excellent for assessing the anteroinferior labrum at the 3-6 o'clock position,
where most labral tears are located. In the ABER position the inferior glenohumeral ligament is stretched resulting in tension on the anteroinferior labrum, allowing intra-articular contrast to get between the labral tear and the glenoid. Rotator cuff tears The ABER view is also very useful for both partial- and full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff. The abduction and external rotation of the arm releases tension on the cuff relative to the normal coronal view obtained with the arm in adduction. As a result, subtle articular-sided partial thickness tears will not lie apposed to the adjacent intact fibers of the remaining rotator cuff
nor be effaced against the humeral head, and intra-articular contrast can enhance visualization of the tear (3). ABER-view. Perthes lesion (arrow) Images in the ABER position are obtained in an axial way 45 degrees off the coronal plane (figure). In that position the 3-6 o'clock region is imaged perpendicular. Notice red arrow indicating a small Perthes-lesion, which was not seen on the standard axial views. Enable Scroll

ABER - anatomy:

Labral variants:
Labral variants and SLAP-tear There are many labral variants. These normal variants are all located in the 11-3 o'clock position. It is important to recognise these variants, because they can mimick a SLAP tear. These normal variants will usually not mimick a Bankart-lesion, since it is located at the 3-6 o'clock position, where these normal variants do not occur. However labral tears may originate at the 3-6 o'clock position and subsequently extend superiorly.
Sublabral recess:
There are 3 types of attachment of the superior labrum at the 12 o'clock position where the biceps tendon inserts. In type I there is no recess between the glenoid cartilage and the labrum. In type II there is a small recess. In type III there is a large sublabral recess. This sublabral recess can be difficult to distinguish from a SLAP-tear or a sublabral foramen. These images illustrate the differences between an sublabral recess and a SLAP-tear. A recess more than 3-5 mm is always abnormal and should be regarded as a SLAP-tear. Sublabral recess The image shows the typical findings of a sublabral recess.
Sublabral Foramen:
A sublabral foramen or sublabral hole is an unattached anterosuperior labrum at the 1-3 o'clock position. It is seen in 11% of individuals. On a MR-arthtrogram a sublabral foramen should not be confused with a sublabral recess or SLAP-tear, which are also located in this region. A sublabral recess however is located at the site of the attachment of the biceps tendon at 12 o'clock and does not extend to the 1-3 o'clock position. A SLAP tear may extend to the 1-3 o'clock position, but the attachment of the biceps tendon to the superior labrum should always be involved. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Sublabral Foramen Scroll through the images and notice the unattached labrum at the 12-3 o'clock position at the site of the sublabral foramen. Notice the smooth borders unlike the margins of a SLAP-tear.
Buford complex:
A Buford complex is a congenital labral variant. The anterosuperior labrum is absent in the 1-3 o'clock position and the middle glenohumeral ligament is usually thickened. It is present in approximately 1.5% of individuals. On these axial images a Buford complex can be identified. The anterior labrum is absent in the 1-3 o'clock position and there is a thickened middle GHL. The thickened middle GHL should not be confused with a displaced labrum. It should always be possible to trace the middle GHL upwards to the glenoid rim and downwards to the humerus. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Video of Buford complex
Os Acromiale:
Failure of one of the acromial ossification centers to fuse will result in an os acromiale. It is present in 5% of the population. Usually it is an incidental finding and regarded as a normal variant. The os acromiale may cause impingement because if it is unstable, it may be pulled inferiorly during abduction by the deltoid, which attaches here. On MR an os acromiale is best seen on the superior axial images. An os acromiale must be mentioned in the report, because in patients who are considered for subacromial decompression,
the removal of the acromion distal to the synchondrosis may further destabilize the synchondrosis and allow for
even greater mobility of the os acromiale after surgery and worsening of the impingement (4). The axial MR-images show an os acromiale with degenerative changes, i.e. subchondral cysts and osteophytes (arrow). by Jaideep J. Iyengar, MD; Keith R. Burnett, MD; Wesley M.

RECIST 1.1 - the basics:

Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors:
Fokko Smits, Martijn Dirksen and Ivo Schoots
Radiology Department of the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam and the Isala hospital in Zwolle, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2020-7-5 RECIST 1.1 is a standard way to measure the response of a tumor to treatment. In this article we will discuss the basics of RECIST. The criteria to determine whether a tumor disappears, shrinks, stays the same or gets bigger are complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). More information is given in the article RECIST 1.1 and more in which we will discuss RECIST 1.1 in more detail and discuss other response systems.
Introduction:
RECIST is a standard way to measure the response of a tumor to treatment. CT is the preferred modality for the baseline study. The baseline scan should be done within 4 weeks before treatment starts and slice thickness ⩽ 5 mm and i.v. contrast are mandatory. Choose target lesions (max 5) that are easy to measure and calculate the sum of the longest diameters (SLD). Identify non-target lesions like ascites or pleural fluid that are not suited for exact measurements, but that can be followed. In the follow up study compare the SLD of the target lesions and determine the presence or abcense of the non-target lesions and look for new lesions. Then determine whether there is complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease. Any new lesion means progressive disease. The response criteria can be seen in the table. The sum of longest diameters of the target lesions (SLD) in the follow up scan has to be compared with the baseline and the smallest SLD during treatment, called the ‘nadir'. The absolute increase of SLD should be ≥ 5mm to be called progressive disease.
Target lesions:
Examples of target lesions Tumors Choose preferably large well-described lesions to measure  with a longest diameter ≥ 10 mm, a maximum of two per organ and a maximum of five for the whole study. Lymph nodes Lymph nodes can be used as target lesions provided that the maximum short axis diameter exceeds 15 mm. Examples of target lesions: Lymph nodes <10 mm are regarded as normal. Lymph nodes 10-14mm are regarded as pathologic, but not suited for target lesions.
They can be used as non-target lesions. When target lymph nodes decrease to a normal size (<10 mm), their measurements still have to be included in the sum of the longest diamters (SLD). Special notes on defining target lesions
Sum of Longest Diameters:
Here an example of a 28-year-old male with a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the appendix. There are 5 lesions suited for measurement: The SLD = diameter of 1+2+3+4+5.
Non-target lesions:
During follow up there is unequivocal progression of lymph node metastases, which were choosen as non-target lesions Non-target lesions are: Examples of non-target lesions: You do not measure non-target lesions, but make a good estimate. In the follow up there are 3 possibilities: Here another example of progression of non-target lesions. CT images in a 73-year-old male with progressive liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. At baseline the liver metastases were too small to be used as target lesions and consequently they were used as non-target lesions.
At follow up there is unequivocal progressions. Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions means progressive disease, even if there is partial response or even disappearance of the target lesions.
New lesions:
Any new lesion means progressive disease. Do consider “new” lesions in an area of the body that was not imaged during baseline (for example brain metastases) as truly “new”, thereby forcing overall response to progressive disease. CT-images in a 81-year-old female with endometrial carcinoma and occurrence of new liver metastases during treatment with chemotherapy. Courtesy Els van Persijn van Meerten. Any new lesion means progressive disease, but not every newly detected lesion is always a true new lesion. In osteolytic bone metastases it can be difficult to determine if a sclerotic lesion that is detected during follow up is truly a new lesion. The sclerotic bone lesions in b and d are not new metastases but an osteoblastic reaction to the therapy.
Response assessment:
This table is the same as the table in the introduction, but demonstrates the overall treatment response with varying responses in the three lesions categories.
Special remarks:
The orientation of the liver metastasis has changed during follow up.

Don'ts:

Fragmentation of lesions:
If a lesion breaks into separate fragments between baseline and follow-up, the sum of longest diameters (SLD) of the fragments should be calculated. Obviously, the short axis diameter is measured for lymph nodes. At follow up the lung metastasis is too small to measure. A default value of 5mm is assigned.
Too small to measure:
At each response evaluation each target lesions should be measured, even when they are very small (e.g. 2 mm). If a target lesion has disappeared record a measurement of 0 mm. If the lesion is too small to measure (faintly seen and not possible to give an exact measurement) assign a default value of 5 mm to prevent false responses or progression (derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness). The images are of a patient with a primary lung tumour.
At baseline, the longest diameter is well above 10 mm, therefore this was assigned as a target lesion. 
During follow-up the long-axis diameter dropped below 10 mm, which is the lower limit for considering a lesion as target lesion. 
However, since this is a follow-up measurement, the target lesion still counts up to the sum of the diameters (SLD) and a default value of 5mm was assigned.
Cavitating lesions:
Cavitation can occur during treatment. 
Cavitating lesions should be continuously measured in their longest diameter. 
A different assessment can be provided if the sum of the longest diameters does not adequately correspond to the patients response assessment. These CT images are of a 32-year-old male with a pulmonary metastasis of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour. Cavitation occured after treatment with pazopanib, but the size remained the same. 
Although the size remains the same, a remark can be made in the report, that the actual tumorvolume has decreased. Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al. Eur J Cancer 2009;45(2):248-260.

MRI of the Paranasal Sinuses:
Laurie Loevner and Jennifer Bradshaw
Radiology department of the University of Pennsylvania, USA and the radiology department the Medical Centre Alkmaar, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2009-02-25 This article is based on a presentation given by Laurie Loevner and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Jennifer Bradshaw. This review focusses on the complimentary roles that CT and MR play in the assessment of: Fibro-osseous lesions Role of CT and MRI
Role of CT and MRI:
CT is of value for determining anatomic landmarks and variants. This information is of vital importance to the ENT-surgeon. In addition, we need it to identify erosive processes and acquired developmental deficiencies of the bone. CT is also excellent for determining whether there is intraorbital extension of sino-nasal disease
in the ventral 2/3 of the orbit. When pathology approaches the orbital apex, an MRI study is necessary to assess spread to the cavernous sinus and intracranial compartment. CT is performed without contrast medium. If additional imaging is necessary, orbital MRI is the next step. Allergic fungal sinusitis - unenhanced CT The real value of unenhanced CT is the following: if you see an opacified sinus with hyperdense contents, it is usually a sign of benign disease.
Tumor is not hyper-dense. The hyperdensity is due to one or a combination of the following: On the left you see a case that was initially interpreted as a tumor. There is hyperdense material in the posterior right ethmoid, the bilateral spheno-ethmoidal recesses, the sphenoid sinus and there is involvement of the clivus. The hyperdensity is a good prognostic sign, indicating a benign process. This is an example of allergic fungal sinusitis. Usually it is more anteriorly located. Allergic fungal sinusitis - unenhanced CT On the left another, more characteristic, example of allergic fungal sinusitis. There is bilateral opacification of the nasal cavities, usually a sign of an inflammatory process or polyps. 
Note the concentric lamellated appearance of alternating hyper- and hypodensity in the maxillary sinusses. The hyperdensity is due to inspissated secretions and fungal elements. The hypodensity reflects cysts, mucosal disease, and granulation tissue.
 In the ethmoidal region some of the hyper-density reflects periostitis and neo-osteogenesis along the septae. The signal intensity of sinus secretions depends on the protein content
Signal characteristics of secretions:
MRI is extremely helpful in complicated sinonasal disease. MRI can discern secretions and mucosa from masses. When you understand the signal characteristics, you are readily able to distinguish soft tissues masses from inspissated secretions. The signal intensity of secretions can vary and mainly depends on the ratio of water to protein and the viscosity. Different protein contents result in different signal intensities on T1 and T2W-images (figure). Fungus usually has a high protein content of more than 28% and can mimic an aerated sinus because it is low on T1- and T2WI. You need CT to make the distinction! MRI is also useful for determining invasion of the skull base. Involvement of the skull base is seen as replacement of the high signal of the fatty marrow on T1WI by hypointense signal of the tumor. Also look for foraminal extension, whether by perineural spread or direct invasion of the tumor. MRI is also the study of choice for detecting intracranial extension of sinonasal disease. Pseudo-pneumatized sinus
Pseudo-pneumatized sinus:
Role of CT and MR (2) On the left a T2W-image in an immuno-compromised patient with fever. Initially a MRI was performed to rule out sinusitis. Notice the low signal intensity of the left sphenoid sinus, which also had a low signal intensity on the T1W-image (not shown). Continue with the CT. Pseudo-pneumatized sinus on MR. Beware of fungus! The CT clearly shows the opacified sinus, which is slightly hyperdense. The signal characteristics on MRI and the attentuation on CT are a result of the high protein content of fungus. This is a good example of the pitfall of the 'pseudo-pneumatized sinus' . This is an example of an Actinomyes infection. So, when invasive fungal infection is suspected,  start with a CT, then move on to MRI to rule out spread to the eye, cavernous sinus and intracranial compartment!
Enhancement:
In general bright signal on T2 is a sign of benign disease, since fluid and mucosal disease usually have a high water content. Secretions do not have solid enhancement. If you have an enhancing mass, you must rule out tumor. On the left an example of infectious sinonasal disease. On the pre-contrast scan you see relatively high signal content of the maxillary sinusses due to proteineous material. After the administration of i.v. contrast there is only enhancement of the circumferential mucosa and no solid enhancement. Lymphoma of sphenoid sinus and skull base Role of CT and MR (3) In complicated cases both CT and MR are needed to demonstrate the extention of the disease. On the left CT-images of a patient post-lung transplant with fever and multiple rapidly progressing cranial nerve palsies. We will show you CT- and MR-images of this patient. The diagnosis lymphoma was made through biopsy. First study the images to study the extention od the disease. Then continue reading. Lymphoma of sphenoid sinus and skull base On the CT-images the findings are: The image on the right is more cranial. There is opacification of the sphenoid sinus with destruction of and osteopenia of the sphenoid bone. CT nicely demonstrates the bone destruction and some of the soft tissue involvement. Continue with the MR-images. Lymphoma of sphenoid sinus and skull base On the left the corresponding MRI. First study the images, then continue reading. The findings are: Continue with the coronal images. Lymphoma of sphenoid sinus and skull base Coronal images of the same patient: T1 pre-and post-contrast. Normal aspect of the right Meckel's cave, tissue in the left Meckel's cave extending into the cavernous sinus (blue arrow). The red arrow points to the dural margin of the cavernous sinus: there is enhancement on both sides of the dura. The disease wraps around the temporal lobe (green arrow) and extents downward in the foramen ovale (yellow arrow) and into the masticator space. The asterix indicates normal non-enhancing tissue in the masticator space. This patient had a lymphoma. Nine out of ten times an immunocompromised patient will have a fungal infection, in one out of ten it will be a lymphoma. CT and MR have a complimentary role in this case, but finally a biopsy is called for to differentiate between these two diagnoses, because of different treatment. Sinonasal carcinoma Role of CT and MR (4) On the left images of a 64-yrs-old, immuno-competent patient, who had a follow-up scan for left-sided vestibular neuroma. On the image on the left hypointense tissue is seen in the pterygo-palatine fossa and videan canal (yellow arrow). On the image on the right, which is more cranial, there is hypointense tissue in the pterygo-maxillary fissure and pterygo-palatine fossa. Continue with the contrast-enhanced T1W-image. Sinonasal carcinoma There is solid enhancement of the abnormality. The differential diagnosis again consists of 2 catagories: neoplasm and chronic invasive fungal infection. In an immuno-competent patient, a neoplasm is much more likely. Continue with the CT-images. Sinonasal carcinoma This is the corresponding CT, performed not to make the diagnosis, but to assess the condition of the adjacent bony structures, especially the sphenoid sinus. Also, it serves to guide the endoscopist for intraoperative biospy. There is extensive destruction of the skull base. Sinonasal carcinoma The coronal image illustrates a normal foramen rotundum on the left (yellow arrow), which on the right has been obliterated by soft tissue. There is extensive bone destruction, and a possible area for biopsy is indicated by the blue arrow. At biopsy the diagnosis of a spindle cell carcinoma was made.
Complications of Sinusitis:
When assessing the complications of sinusitis, CT is excellent for imaging of subperiostial abscesses or orbital extension into the ventral 2/3 of the orbit. MRI is necessary for assessing intracranial complications, such as brain or epidural abscesses, subdural empyema or sinus thrombosis. Brain abscess
Brain abscess:
On the left images of a patient was initially diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme.
There are abnormalities in both frontal lobes. Notice however the abnormal tissue in the frontal sinus (yellow arrow), subperiosteal abscess (red arrow) and the fluid-fluid level (green arrow) in the large intracranial lesion which has ring enhancement. All abnormalities are continuous meaning there is frontal bony destruction. The restricted diffusion also supports the diagnosis of brain abscess. This is a subperiosteal abscess and osteomyelitis of the frontal bone, usually with a soft tender swelling of the forehead. This is also called Pott's puffy tumor after Sir Pott, an English surgeon who first described this entity. Brain abscess Brain abscess (2) On the left images of another patient, who had recently been treated for sinusitis and now presented with a seizure.
The CT shows an abnormality in the left temporal lobe with shaggy thick rim enhancement, and a large amount of vasogenic edema.
This is also a brain abscess, most probably due to reflux of bacteria into cranial veins and the venous plexus around the cavernous sinus. Mucocele
Mucocele:
Mucoceles are benign, locally expansile paranasal sinus masses most commonly found in the frontal sinus. Secondary to obstruction of the sinus ostia, there is accumulation of fluid within a mucoperiosteal lined cavity, resulting in erosion and remodelling of the surrounding bone. The most common causes of mucoceles are chronic infection, allergic sinonasal disease, trauma and previous surgery. The most common location of a mucocele is the fronto-ethmoidal sinus, followed by the sphenoid sinus. 
The least common location is the maxillary sinus. On the left a patient with an uncommon cause of a mucocele. Notice the obstructing solid mass at the frontal ethmoidal junction (yellow arrows). Mucocele secondary to obstructing tumor Pre- and post-contrast MRI of the same patient. The mucocele shows high signal intensity on T1W (benign finding). The mass in the ethmoidal region is hypointense and solidly enhancing. Mucocele (2) The case on the left shows two classic complications of frontal facial trauma. The bilateral nasal fractures are the clue to a traumatic etiology. Looking at the CT scan on the far left you will notice a convex soft tissue mass in the frontal sinus. The corresponding MRI shows a round hyperintense structure in the same location. Study the images on the left and then continue reading. Posttraumatic mucocele and encephalocele Now look again carefully at the far left CT. Did you notice the bony defect on the left side, at the lateral border of the ethmoid air space (yellow arrow)? The MRI shows that there is brain tissue at the site of the defect. This patient had both a mucocele and an acquired encephalocele. The two most common causes of mucoceles are trauma and chronic inflammation due to blockage of the ostia. Bilateral mucoceles Mucocele (3) This companion case nicely demonstrates bilateral mucoceles. This patient has chronic sinusitis with sino-nasal opacification, mucoid impaction in the maxillary sinusses and huge bilateral mucoceles. The CT shows hyperdensity and the MRI shows hyperintensity on T2WI, both of which you will remember are benign signs in sino-nasal disease, indicating a proteinaceous substance. There is smooth bone remodelling and elevation of the frontal sinusses, and although it looks as if there is bony destruction at the orbital boundary of the frontal sinus, usually the surgeon will still see a fine line of bone in place.
Orbital Cellulitis and Abscess:
Left is an axial T1WI, right is a coronal T2WI. There is an abnormality on the left side, but to a lesser degree also on the right. Try to determine which structures are involved. The yellow arrows point to the naso-lacrimal ducts. The naso-lacrimal sac connects with the duct, which then drains into the inferior meatus. On the left there is peri-orbital pre-septal soft tissue swelling. On the coronal image there is bilateral high signal at the junction of the nasolacrimal duct and sac, indicative of a fluid collection. On the left side there is also edema of the surrounding tissue. Orbital cellulitis and abscess Post-contrast T1WI, axial and coronal. Lateral to the naso-lacrimal ducts on both sides, there are the fluid collections which now show peripheral enhancement. Complicated acute sinusitis The additional images (T2WI) show mucosal disease of the right maxillary sinus and a fluid level in the left maxillary sinus, in addition to extensive ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinus disease. This patient had acute sinusitis which was complicated by orbital cellulitis and dacrocystitis with abscesses. Developmental or inflammatory narrowing of the naso-lacrimal duct is a risk factor for developing dacrocystitis. See the article on Orbital Pathology by David Youssem for more information about orbital and periorbital cellulitis Tension pneumocephalus
Complication of FESS:
A rare complication of FESS is seen on the images on the left. The Hounsfields Units of the tiny abnormalities that the asterisk points to were around -120. First study the axial images. Then continue with the coronal images. Tension pneumocephalus There is a bone defect at the fovea ethmoidalis (red arrow). Also there are post-operative changes indicating that the patient had undergone FESS. The intracranial air is a complication of FESS. With this complication, usually the patient goes home feeling fine, and then shows up approximately two weeks later with CSF leak and meningitis, due to the defect in the bone and dura. Tension pneumocephalus occurs when air in the head acts like a mass: there is a bony defect which lets air in but not out (valve-like function). Every time the patient sneezes, air is forced through the defect into the intra-cranial space, and remains trapped there. At a certain moment the amount of air is sufficient to cause mass effect on the surrounding intra-cranial structures.
Tumor and tumorlike lesions:
Role of CT and MR When it comes to imaging of neoplasms of the paranasal sinuses, CT and MRI play complementary roles. It is not about the histology but about answering the question 'is it tumor or not?' and then determining the extent of the disease, for example intracranial or orbital extension. Use MRI to differentiate inspissated secretions from neoplasms. Scanning down to the hyoid bone allows for examination of the levels I and II lymph nodes: about
10% of paranasal neoplasms have nodal metastases at presentation. Encephalocele
Encephalocele:
Coronal T2WI of the patient on the left show an abnormal structure in the right nasal cavity. When you've decided what it is, then stop to think about whether the abnormality is developmental or acquired. This patient has an encephalocele. There are two findings on the images that let you know that this is developmental. First of all, notice the smaller encephalocele on the left side (green arrow). Acquired encephaloceles are more often than not unilateral. The second clue is the cortical dysplasia (yellow arrow) as part of a migrational abnormality. Acquired encephaloceles (ie after surgery) tend to lead to dead gliotic brain, which would have a high signal intensity on T2WI. The strange looking structure in the left image (red arrow) is surgical packing, placed there after the involuntary encounter with brain tissue. Encephalocele Sag T1WI. The blue arrow points to the sphenoid sinus which is hyperintense, due to mucoid impaction as a result of obstruction by the encephalocele. Mucocele (blue arrow) secondary to obstructing tumor (yellow arrow)
Inverted papilloma:
Inverted papilloma is characterized by inversion of the neoplastic epithelium into the underlying stroma. It presents as a unilateral nasal polyp arising from the lateral nasal wall, usually in the region of the middle meatus and middle turbinate. Extension into the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses is common. It causes non-specific symptoms like nasal congestion or epistaxis. Biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis and because more than 10% of inverted papillomas harbor a squamous cell carcinoma. Inverted papilloma (asterix) pre- and postcontrast MR When you want to differentiate inspissated secretions from neoplasms it is important to have pre- and post-contrast images. If you were to just look at the post-contrast study on the right, you might be tempted to think that there was solid enhancement of the mass in the nasal cavity (asterisk) as well as in the ethmoidal and maxillary sinus on the right. Looking at the pre-contrast study, however, you will notice that the contents of the ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses are hyperintense as opposed to the mass in the nasal cavity (the middle meatal region), because the sinuses are filled with inspissated secretions. This solidly enhancing mass is a tumor until proven otherwise. The imaging findings are non-specific and the differential diagnosis includes a polyp or a carcinoma. Biopsy revealed an inverted papilloma. Inverted papilloma Inverted papilloma (2) On the left another patient who presented with nasal stuffiness. Study the images on the left. Decide for yourself whether you are looking at a solid mass, inspissated secretions, a combination of both or something entirely different. The pre-contrast T1WI shows a hyperintense area within the maxillary sinus, corresponding to a proteinaceous substance. Medial to it is an area with hypointense signal similar to the signal in the orbital globes (so probably cystic). The majority of the soft tissue in the right maxillary sinus is relatively hypointense on the pre-contrast T1WI,
but solidly enhances, meaning tumor. Inverted papilloma in typical location The T2W-image on the left confirms the cystic element (yellow arrow). The coronal CT nicely demonstrates remodelling of the bone and expansion (arrowheads). This proved to be an inverting papilloma. The localisation is rather typical. Sinonasal carcinoma
Malignant tumors of the sinonasal tract:
Malignant tumors of the sinonasal tract are extremely rare. The clinical presentation is non-specific and often mimics benign disease. As a result a delay in diagnosis is common. 75% of all paranasal sinus tumors are Stage T3 or T4 at the time of diagnosis. Perineural spread is a manifestation of advanced disease and indicates a poor prognosis. On the left an axial MR-image showing a mass in the ethmoids. The MRI shows no intracranial extension. What is the next step? Sinonasal carcinoma A CT is necessary to determine the integrity of the adjacent bone. Notice the bony destruction of the fovea ethmoidalis and planum sphenoidale. This indicates that this is a malignant lesion and biopsy demonstrated an adenocarcinoma. If the patient is a surgical candidate, frontal endoscopic sino-nasal surgery won't be enough and a cranio-facial take-down will also be required. Meningioma
Meningioma:
A meningioma can spread transcranially. On the left is a patient with a meningioma, which spreads along the anterior clinoid (arrow). Continue with a coronal image more anteriorly. Transcranial spread of meningioma MRI nicely demonstrates how the meningioma spreads down into the sino-nasal cavity. Keratocyst
Keratocyst:
First look at the images on the left. From where is this lesion arising? The lesion is expansile with bone remodelling and there is an obvious relation to a tooth. It is very important to determine whether or not sinus pathology has an odontogentic origin, simply
because the surgical approach is different. If odontogentic, the surgery will be done preferably by a maxillofacial surgeon. If approached by a sino-nasal route it won't be removed entirely. This is a keratocyst Keratocyst On the left another case. This patient presented with facial pain. On this contrast-enhanced MRI we see a non-enhancing expansile lesion in the right maxillary sinus. As it doesn't enhance, we know we aren't dealing with tumor. It is tempting to call this a retention cyst and move on to the next case, but a CT is called for to make the correct diagnosis. Keratocyst The corresponding CT shows elevation of the maxillary bone (blue arrow). The red arrow in the right image indicates the cyst dissecting around the root of a tooth. This is also a keratocyst. Silent sinus
Silent sinus:
On the left a patient who presented with asymmetric eyes. First study the images and try to describe what is going on. Then continue reading. This film was originally read as ethmoid sinusitis and post-surgery.
However, this patient had never undergone sino-nasal surgery. What you in fact see, is adhesion of the middle right turbinate (red arrow) and the uncinate process
to the floor of the orbit. There is also volume loss of the right maxillary sinus. This is called the silent sinus syndrome, which consists of painless facial asymmetry and enophthalmos caused by chronic maxillary sinus atelectasis. The most characteristic imaging feature of the silent sinus syndrome is the inward retraction of the sinus walls into the sinus lumen with associated decrease in sinus volume and enlargement of the middle meatus (2).
In many cases the infundibulum is occluded due to lateral retraction of the uncinate process.
Fibro-osseous Lesions:
Fibro-osseous lesions are very common incidental findings and often misinterpreted as tumor. CT is usually diagnostic, so when you see a bizarre lesion at the skull-base, think of a fibro-osseous lesion and get an unenhanced CT. The most common skull base lesion is fibrous dysplasia, followed by osteomas. Osteomas are usually located in the sino-nasal cavities. Fibromas are less common and can be ossifying or non-ossifying. Malignancies are rare. Fibrous dysplasia
Fibrous dysplasia:
On the left images of a patient who was thought to have a chondrosarcoma. On the T2W-images there is a hypointense lesion (yellow arrow) with a cystic component (red arrow). On the pre- and post-contrast T1W-images there is solid enhancement of a mass with peripheral enhancement of the cystic portion. Question: what should be the next step? Classic fibrous dysplasia on CT Next step: get a CT! On CT this is classic fibrous dysplasia (FD) with cortical sparing and ground-glass appearance. Many of the fibrous dysplasia lesions in the clivus, skull base or sino-nasal cavity and in children may have large cystic components, so don't let that dissuade you from the diagnosis! Fibrous dysplasia of the middle turbinate Fibrous dysplasia (2) On the left another example of fibrous dysplasia. This lesion originates from the middle turbinate. Fibrous dysplasia Fibrous dysplasia (3) On the left another patient read as having a soft tissue tumor (yellow arrow) anterior to the temporal bone. Fibrous dysplasia These are the corresponding axial CT images showing classic fibrous dysplasia of the sphenoid wing. The differential diagnosis is a meningioma. Fibrous dysplasia Fibrous dysplasia (4) On the left images of a different patient with soft tissue in the sphenoid sinus on the left, and an abnormality of the left sphenoid wing, which is about 3 times its normal size whilst maintaining its normal shape. On the post-contrast images there is solid enhancement. Again the diagnosis is fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a very vascular lesion and can enhance avidly. Osteitis of the middle turbinate
Osteitis:
In contrast, this is a patient with osteitis of the middle turbinate and ethmoid septae. Note the laminated high density, due to chronic inflammation and recurrent periostal reaction with neo-osteogenesis around the septae. Osteoma in frontal sinus
Osteoma:
This is a patient who had been having brain MRI for the past 1,5 yrs for frontal headaches. On the MRI (not shown) it looked as if the patient had a little mucosal disease of the frontal sinus. The sinus CT clearly shows an osteoma with a bony defect (arrow) indicating progressive growth. This lesion requires surgical excision. Note: multiple para-nasal osteomas are found in Gardner's syndrome, which also includes cutaneous and soft tissues tumors in addition to colonic polyps with a predilection to malignant degeneration.

2. The Silent Sinus Syndrome by Anna Illner et al. AJR 2002; 178:503-506
Temporal Bone Pathology:
Eric Beek and Frank Pameijer
Radiology department of the University Medical Centre of Utrecht, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2009-07-01 The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate imaging findings of common diseases of the temporal bone. CT is the imaging modality of choice for most of the pathologic conditions of the temporal bone, especially for those of the middle ear. MRI is more useful for diseases of the inner ear. Disease processes in the pontine angle and in the internal acoustic meatus are not discussed.
Normal variants:
Illustration of a cholesteatoma There are several normal variants which may simulate disease or should be reported because they can endanger the surgical approach. Variants which may simulate disease: Variants which may pose a danger during surgery: On the left an illustration of a cholesteatoma. This will be discussed later. Bilateral cochlear cleft presents as a line-like lucency lateral to the cochlear apex. (arrows)
Cochlear cleft:
A cochlear cleft is a narrow curved lucency extending from the cochlea towards the promontory. It is often visible in infants and children but can also be seen in adults. It can be mistaken for a fracture line or an otosclerotic focus. On the left an example of bilateral cochlear cleft in a one-year old boy with congenital hearing loss. Petromastoid canal
Petromastoid canal:
The petromastoid canal or subarcuate canal connects the mastoid antrum with the cranial cavity and houses the subarcuate artery and vein. Its diameter is around 0.5 mm. It can be confused with a fracture line. On the left a 40-year old female with a sclerotic mastoid. The petromastoid canal is easily seen. (arrow) Petromastoid canal On the left a well-pneumatized mastoid. The petromastoid canal is difficult to discern (arrow). Petromastoid canal On the left another patient with a sclerotic mastoid. The petromastoid canal is well seen. If this patient would be a trauma victim, the canal could easily be confused with a fracture line (arrow). Cochlear aqueduct
Cochlear aqueduct:
The cochlear aqueduct connects the perilymph with the subarachoid space. The cochlear aqueduct is a narrow canal which runs towards the cochlea in almost the same direction as the inner auditory canal, but situated more caudally. It is a point where infected cerebrospinal fluid can enter the inner ear. This can happen in patients with meningitis and cause labyrinthitis ossificans. On the left a 58-year old male. The blue arrow indicates the cochlear aqueduct coursing towards the cochlea. This could be mistaken for a fracture line (arrow). Note there is also opacification of the tympanic cavity and mastoid air cells. High jugular bulb: axial and coronal image
High jugular bulb:
On the left axial and coronal images of a 64-year old male. The jugular bulb rises above the lower limb of the posterior semicircular canal (arrows). The jugular bulb is often asymmetric, with the right jugular bulb usually being larger than the left. If it reaches above the posterior semicircular canal it is called a high jugular bulb. If the bony separation between the jugular bulb and the tympanic cavity is absent, it is termed a dehiscent jugular bulb. Rarely an outpouching is seen – this is known as a jugular bulb diverticulum. Jugular bulb diverticulum: axial and coronal image
Jugular bulb diverticulum:
On the left axial and coronal images of a 50-year old male. Incidental finding of a jugular bulb diverticulum (arrows). Bulging sigmoid sinus
Bulging sigmoid sinus:
The sigmoid sinus can protrude into the posterior mastoid. It can be accidentally lacerated during a mastoidectomy and therefore should be mentioned in the radiological report when present. On the left an axial image of a 43-year old male, post-mastoidectomy. The sigmoid sinus bulges anteriorly
Congenital anomalies:
Large vestibular aqueduct bilaterally (black arrows). The bony modiolus is not visible (white arrow).
Large vestibular aqueduct:
The vestibular aqueduct is a narrow bony canal (aqueduct) that connects the endolymphatic sac with the inner ear (vestibule). Running through this bony canal is a tube called the endolymphatic duct. A large vestibular aqueduct is associated with progressive sensorineural hearing loss. This progression is reportedly associated with minor head trauma, which exposes the inner ear to pressure waves via the large vestibular aqueduct. The large vestibular aqueduct is associated with an absence of the bony modiolus in more than 90% of patients. On the left a patient with a bilateral large vestibular aqueduct. Notice that the bony modiolus is not visible. On the left a 5-year old boy with bilateral progressive hearing loss. A large vestibular aqueduct is seen (black arrow). The cochlea has no bony modiolus. (white arrow). External auditory canal atresia
External auditory canal atresia:
In external ear atresia the external auditory canal is not developed and sound cannot reach the tympanic membrane. A conductive hearing loss is the result. It is important to note whether the atretic plate is composed of soft tissue or bone. The extent of ossicular chain malformation can vary from a fusion of the mallear head and incudal body to a small clump of malformed ossicles, which is often fused to the wall of the tympanic cavity. The mastoid portion of the facial nerve canal can be located more anteriorly than normal and this is important to report to the ENT surgeon in order to avoid iatrogenic injury to the nerve during surgery. On the left a 2-year old boy with bilateral bony external auditory canal atresia. The malleus and incus are fused (arrow). The cochlea is normal. Minor cochlear deformity
Cochlear deformities:
The cochlea develops between 3 and 10 weeks of gestation. Early developmental arrest leads to an inner ear that consists of a small cyst, the so-called Michel deformity. Developmental arrest at a later stage leads to more or less severe deformities of the cochlea and of the vestibular apparatus. An incomplete partition of the cochlea is called a Mondini malformation Instead of the normal two-and-one-half turns, there is only a normal basal turn and a cystic apex. On the left a 2-year old girl. The images are of a CT-examination is done prior to cochlear implantation. A minor deformity of the cochlear apex is visible – there is no separation of the second and third turn and the bony modiolus is absent. The vestibular aqueduct is normal. Malformed lateral semicircular canal
Lateral semicircular canal malformation:
Malformations of the vestibule and semicircular canals vary from a common cavity to all these structures to a hypoplastic lateral semicircular canal. During embryogenesis the lateral semicircular canal is the last structure to form, thus in malformations of the semicircular canals the lateral canal is most commonly affected. On the left a 10-year old boy, scheduled for cochlear implantation. There is a widening and shortening of the lateral semicircular canal. The vestibule is relatively large (arrow). Malformed lateral and superior semicircular canal On the left a 16-year old boy, examined preoperatively for a cholesteatoma of the right ear. As a coincidental finding, there is a plump lateral semicircular canal (yellow arrow) and an absence of the superior canal (blue arrow). In the expected position of the superior canal only a bump is seen. The posterior canal is normal.
Chronic otitis media:
Normal pneumatization (left) and a completely sclerotic mastoid (right) For the ENT-surgeon the differentiation between chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma is important. Both diseases often occur in poorly pneumatized mastoids. An important finding which can help differentiate the two conditions is bony erosion. Erosion of the lateral wall of the epitympanum and of the ossicular chain is common in cholesteatoma (around 75%). Erosion can occur in chronic otitis, but reportedly in less than 10% of patients. Displacement of the ossicular chain can be seen in cholesteatoma, not in chronic otitis. Cholesteatoma can present with a non-dependent mass while chronic otitis shows thickened mucosal lining. However, in both diseases the middle ear cavity can be completely opacified, obscuring a cholesteatoma. On the far left a 54-year old male with a normally pneumatized mastoid with aerated cells. Next to it a 69-year old female. The mastoid is completely sclerotic - no air cells are present. Chronic otitis media On the left a 14-year old boy. The eardrum is thickened. A small amount of soft tissue (arrow) is visible between the scutum and the ossicular chain but no erosion is present. This favors the diagnosis of chronic otitis media. Tympanosclerosis On the left an 11-year old girl with bilateral ear infections. There is calcification of the eardrum (white arrow) and calcific deposits on the stapes and the tendon of the stapedius muscle (black arrow). Chronic otitis media On the left a 37-year old female who was admitted with a peritonsillar abscess. She
also suffered from chronic otitis media. CT shows a tympanostomy
tube (yellow arrow) and almost complete
opacification of the
tympanic cavity and mastoid air cells with soft tissue. Note: No air present in
the lumen of the tympanostomy tube Calcification is visible
around the head of the stapes (blue arrow). No erosions are present. Chronic otitis media On the left a coronal reconstruction of the same patient. CT shows the tympanostomy tube (yellow arrow) and complete opacification of the tympanic cavity and mastoid air cells with soft tissue.
Cholesteatoma:
Cholesteatoma: 20-year old woman with recurrent otitis. Granulations on left ear drum. Soft tissue mass between ossicular chain and lateral tympanic wall, which is eroded. Right side for comparison. Cholesteatoma is believed to arise in retraction pockets of the eardrum. It gradually enlarges over time due to exfoliation and encapsulation of the tissue. Most cholesteatomas are acquired, but some are congenital. The ENT surgeon often states that cholesteatoma is a clinical diagnosis.
Scraps of cholesteatoma are visible in the external auditory canal. On CT a small cholesteatoma presents as a soft tissue mass. In more extensive disease erosions may be present. Large cholesteatomas can erode the auditory ossicles and the walls of the antrum and extend into the middle cranial fossa. The most affected structures are: On the left a 20-year old woman with recurrent otitis. There were granulations on the left ear drum. CT demonstrates a soft tissue mass between the ossicular chain and the lateral tympanic wall, which is eroded. this favors the diagnosis of cholesteatoma. 20-year old woman with recurrent otitis. Granulations on left ear drum. Soft tissue mass between ossicular chain and lateral tympanic wall, which is eroded. Right side for comparison. On the left the coronal images of the same patient as above. Notice how the cholesteatoma has eroded the scutum (arrow). There are two patterns of spread: A cholesteatoma will then extend laterally towards the ossicular chain and into the epitympanum.
* Pars tensa cholesteatoma The cholesteatoma begins posterosuperiorly and extends posteriorly towards the facial recess and tympanic sinus, and medially towards the ossicular chain. Cholesteatoma of the right ear with destruction of body of the incus and the scutum On the left a large cholesteatoma in the right middle ear with destruction of the lateral wall of the tympanic cavity. The body of the incus, which is lateral to the mallear head is also eroded (arrow). CT signs of cholesteatoma are: Erosion of the facial nerve canal is difficult to distinguish
because the wall is often so thin that it is not visible at CT. Cholesteatoma On the left a 50-year old male with hearing loss on the left side. There is a soft tissue mass with erosion of the long process of the incus. This location is typical of a pars tensa cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma with erosion of the wall of the lateral semicircular canal On the left images of a cholesteatoma, which has eroded the ossicular chain and the wall of the lateral semicircular canal (arrows). The thickened ear drum is perforated. Automastoidectomy due to a large cholesteatoma On the left images of a 6-year old boy. A large cholesteatoma has resulted in a so called 'automastoidectomy', with severe erosion of the lateral tympanic cavity wall and destruction of the ossicular chain. Chronic mastoiditis. No cholesteatoma. These images are of a 50-year old man who presented with a left- sided retraction pocket and otorrhoea. CT shows erosion of the long process of the incus and of the stapedial superstructure. All these findings favor the diagnosis of a cholesteatoma, but at surgery, chronic mastoiditis was found and no cholesteatoma was identified. A minority of patients with chronic mastoiditis show bony erosions. Chronic mastoiditis. No cholesteatoma. On the left coronal images of the same patient. The scutum is blunted (arrow). Cholesteatoma with fistula to the lateral semicircular canal (arrow) On the left an image of a 53-year old man complaining of vertigo. He had undergone several ear operations in the past. The CT shows erosion of the wall of the lateral semicircular canal (arrow) due to cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma with lateral displacement of the incus with erosion of its lenticular process and of the stapes On the left a 22-year old man suffering from persistent otitis. The right ear shows a soft tissue mass medial to the ossicular chain with lateral displacement of the incus with erosion of its lenticular process and of the stapes, compatible with a pars tensa cholesteatoma (arrow). Cholesteatoma with lateral displacement of the incus with erosion of its lenticular process and of the stapes On the left coronal images of the same patient. 75-year old man with known recurrent cholesteatoma. The examination shows a mass with mixed intensity on sagittal T1 and high intensity on transverse T2 weighted images. It has a high intensity on diffusion weighted images, which indicates restricted diffusion. (arrows) Cholesteatomas are of mixed intensity on T1-weighted pulse sequences and of high intensity on T2-weighted pulse sequences. MRI is particularly useful for evaluating the extension of a cholesteatoma into the middle and/or posterior fossa, and for demonstrating possible herniation of intracranial contents into the temporal bone - especially after surgery. After intravenous contrast MRI can distinguish granulation tissue from effusions. Diffusion weighted MR can differentiate between a cholesteatoma, which has a restricted diffusion, and other abnormalities - especially granulation tissue - which have normal diffusion characteristics (figure).
Otosclerosis:
Otosclerosis anteriorly to the oval window (arrow) Otosclerosis is a genetically mediated metabolic bone disease of unknown etiology. It is sometimes called otospongiosis because the disease begins with an otospongiotic phase, which is followed by an otosclerotic phase when osteoclasts are replaced by osteoblasts and dense sclerotic bone is deposited in areas of previous bone resorption. When this process involves the oval window in the region of the footplate, the footplate becomes fixed, resulting in conductive hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss develops early in the third decade and is considered to be the hallmark of the disease. However, involvement of other portions of the otic capsule can result in mixed sensorineural hearing loss. The process starts in the region of the oval window, classically at the fissula ante fenestram, i.e. in front of the oval window (fenestral otosclerosis). It can also occur around the cochlea (retrofenestral otosclerosis). On the left a transverse CT-image of a 23-year old female with conductive hearing loss. There is a subtle otosclerotic focus in the characteristic site: the fissula ante fenestram (arrows). Otosclerosis On CT the detection of otosclerosis can be difficult to the inexperienced eye because the spread of the disease is often symmetrical. A small lucency at the fissula ante fenestram is typical for otosclerosis. In more severe cases lucencies are also present around the cochlea. Sometimes the whole otic capsule is surrounded by these 'otospongiotic' foci, forming the so-called fourth ring of Valvassori. In a minority of patients the disease is unilateral. This is virtually always limited to a lucency at the fissula ante fenestram. On the left a 49-year old male with left sided conductive hearing loss. There is a lucency anterior to the oval window (arrow) and between the cochlea and the internal auditory canal. This is combined fenestral and retrofenestral otosclerosis. Bilateral otosclerosis Same patient. Notice that the otosclerosis is seen on both sides. Metallic stapedial prosthesis. Lucency between vestibule and cochlea as a manifestation of otosclerosis (arrow) On the left a patient with a well-positioned metallic stapedial prosthesis: medially it touches the oval window and laterally it connects with the long process of the incus. Notice the lucency between vestibule and cochlea as a manifestation of otosclerosis (arrow).
Trauma:
Incus dislocation (arrow) On the left images of a 68-year old woman who experienced a traumatic head injury 50 years ago. Three years ago she was diagnosed with total hearing loss of the right ear. The image shows a subluxation of the incudomallear joint (arrow). Left ear for comparison. Fractures of the temporal bone are associated with head injuries. The consequences of the intracranial injuries dominate in the early period after the trauma. A temporal bone fracture can manifest itself with acute signs like bleeding from the ear or acute facial paralysis. Hearing loss is of course not a life-threatening event. Temporal bone fractures can be classified as longitudinal or transverse. Longitudinal fractures generally spare the inner ear, which is more often breached by transverse fractures. However, many temporal bone fractures are neither longitudinal nor transverse and a comprehensive description of the structures which are crossed by the fracture is needed. Sensorineural hearing loss due to longitudinal fracture (arrows) On the left images of a woman who had fallen down from the stairs three days earlier. She suffered from severe sensorineural hearing loss on the left side. A longitudinal fracture is visible, which courses anteriorly to the cochlea through the region of the geniculate ganglion (arrows). There were no signs of facial nerve paralysis. No fracture line could be seen across the inner ear. Opacification of the middle ear, likely as a result of a hematotympanum. Right ear for comparison. Posttraumatic conductive hearing loss can be caused by a hematotympanum or a tear of the tympanic membrane. In these cases the hearing loss usually resolves spontaneously. In persistent conductive hearing loss there is usually a disruption of the ossicular chain. The most common disruption is a dislocation of the incudostapedial joint which is often a subtle finding. Disruptions can occur at the incudomallear joint. Fractures of the long process of the incus or the crura of the stapes are difficult to diagnose. Fractures of the inner ear are seen in posttraumatic sensorineural hearing loss. Careful inspection is required in order to pick out these thin fracture lines. Cochlear concussion with blood in the cochlea can be visualized with MRI. Longitudinal fracture (yellow arrow) coursing through the mastoid towards the region of the geniculate ganglion. Dislocation of the incus with luxation of the incudo-mallear and incudo-stapedial joint (blue arrow). On the left images of a man who had suffered a traumatic head injury two months previously. He complained of intermittent tinnitus. There is a longitudinal fracture (yellow arrow) coursing through the mastoid towards the region of the geniculate ganglion. There is a dislocation of the incus with luxation of the incudo-mallear and incudo-stapedial joint (blue arrow). No involvement of the inner ear. Left ear for comparison. Transverse fracture through vestibule and facial nerve canal (arrows) On the left images of a 54-year old male several years after head trauma, followed by left-sided hearing loss.
There is a transverse fracture through the vestibule and facial nerve canal (arrows).
The lateral semicircular canal is partially filled with dense material, compatible with labyrinthitis ossificans. Facial nerve paralysis can be acute or delayed. In acute posttraumatic paralysis a fracture line through the facial nerve canal - usually in the tympanic part - can be observed, sometimes with a bony fragment impinging on the canal. In delayed facial paralysis the nerve is probably edematous and fracture lines can be absent. On the other hand, a fracture line may be seen to cross the facial nerve canal without any associated nerve dysfunction. Several normal structures may be mistaken for fractures:
Vascular anomalies:
A vascular anomaly can be suspected if the patient complains of pulsatile tinnitus or when there is a reddish or bluish mass behind the eardrum. Vascular anomalies are: Non-vascular anomalies which can also manifest as a retrotympanic mass: Aberrant internal carotid artery (courtesy of Hervé Tanghe)
Aberrant internal carotid artery:
In patients with an aberrant internal carotid artery the cervical part of the internal carotid artery is absent. It is replaced by the ascending pharyngeal artery which connects with the horizontal part of the internal carotid artery. It courses through the middle ear. Aberrant internal carotid artery (courtesy of Hervé Tanghe) On the left coronal images of the same patient. On the right side the internal carotid artery is separated from the middle ear (blue arrow). On the left side the internal carotid artery courses through the middle ear (red arrow) Dehiscent jugular bulb
Dehiscent jugular bulb:
On the left a dehiscent jugular bulb (blue arrow). This can be dangerous during myringotomy. Note also the bulging sigmoid sinus (yellow arrow).
Tumors:
Tumors of the temporal bone are rare. The following tumors can be seen: Schwannomas will not be discussed Bilateral exostoses
Exostoses:
On the left bilateral bony lesions of the external auditory canal, typical of exostoses. Exostoses of the external auditory canal are usually multiple, sessile, and bilateral and can cause severe narrowing of the external auditory canal. Exostoses are caused by contact with cold water and mostly seen in swimmers and surfers. Osteomas are less common and mostly unilateral and pedunculated. Glomus tumor in the jugular foramen
Glomus tumor:
On the left images of a 57-year old male with a slowly progressive glomus jugulotympanicum tumor, visible as a mass on the floor of the tympanic cavity (arrow). Mucus is seen in the meso- and epitympanum. At CT, the glomus jugulotympanic tumor manifests as a destructive lesion at the jugular foramen, often spreading into the hypotympanum. The bone can be permeated by tumor. The glomus tympanicum tumor is typically a small soft tissue mass on the promontory. Large tumors have a 'salt and pepper' appearance at MRI due to their rich vascularity with flow voids. They enhance strongly after i.v. contrast. Glomus tumor before and after embolization Embolization
can diminish intra-operative blood loss. On the left angiographic
images of the left external carotid artery before embolisation and the common
carotid artery after embolization (blue arrow). Only a faint blush remains. Glomus tumors arise from paraganglion cells which are present in the jugular foramen and on the promontory of the cochlea around the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Elderly persons are most commonly affected with a female predominance. The presenting symptoms are conductive hearing loss, tinnitus, and pain. At otoscopy a blue ear drum is seen. Glomus tumors of the jugular foramen (also called glomus jugulotympanicum tumors) are more common than tumors which are confined to the middle ear (glomus tympanicum tumor) EndoLymphatic Sac Tumor: destructive process of the dorsal temporal bone, with some calcification (arrow). The location, destruction, and calcification are typical for ELST. A small extension of the tumor into the middle ear is present
EndoLymphatic Sac Tumor (ELST):
ELST is a rare entity. These tumors originate from the endolymphatic sac. We will discuss them because their CT appearance is very typical. At CT a destructive process is seen on the dorsal surface of the petrosal part of the temporal bone with punctate calcifications. On MRI there is usually strong enhancement. The amount of destruction in this case would be atypical for a meningioma. EndoLymphatic Sac Tumor: T1WI before and after i.v. contrast On the left a large destructive process of the dorsal temporal bone. Parts of the tumor show strong enhancement. There is a cystic component on the dorsal aspect which does not enhance. EndoLymphatic Sac Tumor: T2WI Notice the cystic component of the tumor on a T2W-image
Postoperative ear:
The postoperative ear is often difficult to describe. A previous CT-examination, if present, can be a lot of help. The best one can do is to describe the extent of the previous operation, the state of the ossicular chain (if present), and the aeration of the postoperative cavity. This cavity can be filled with swollen mucosa, recurrent disease or with some tissue implanted during the operation. Attico-antrotomy

Tympanostomy tubes:
If the Eustachian tube is assumed to be dysfunctioning, tympanostomy tubes can be inserted into the eardrum to facilitate the drainage of middle ear fluid. In young children the course of the Eustachian tube between the middle ear and the nasopharynx runs more horizontally than in adults, predisposing to stasis of fluid in the middle ear and secondary infection. After a while tympanostomy tubes are extruded by the eardrum and can be seen to lay in the external auditory canal. The image on the left shows a dislocated tube lying in the external auditory canal. Metallic stapes prosthesis
Stapes prosthesis:
Stapes prostheses are inserted in patients with otosclerosis to replace the native stapes, which is fixed in the oval window. Steel stapes prostheses are easily visible. Prostheses made of Teflon can be almost invisible. One should describe the position of the prosthesis in the oval window and the integrity of its connection with the long process of the incus. On the left images of a metallic stapes prosthesis. The prosthesis is in a good position. Medially it lies in the oval window, laterally it connects to the long process of the incus. On the left a patient with a stapes prosthesis. The metallic prosthesis is dislocated and lies in the vestibule. A re-operation was performed and a new prosthesis was inserted.

It is connected to the long process of the incus (yellow arrow). The tip lies in the oval window (blue arrow).
Incus interpostion:
A remodelled incus can be used to repair the ossicular chain. Most often it is inserted between the eardrum and the stapes superstructure. The interposed incus can either be the patient's own or one from a cadaver. Alternatively, a Partial Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis (PORP) or Total Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis (TORP) can be used. On the left images of a 13 -year old boy.

Postoperative meningocele:
In postoperative imaging look for dehiscence of the bony covering of the sigmoid sinus and for interruption of the tegmen tympani. A herniation of cranial contents can be present. If the tegmen is disrupted and continuous soft tissue is present between the middle ear and the cranial contents, MRI can be used to demonstrate if there is a postoperative meningo (encephalo)cele.

cochlea, something which is not appreciated on CT. MRI, on the other hand, can show a
fluid-filled cochlea while CT depicts small calcifications. Therefore, a combination of both
modalities can be used. MRI can also demonstrate absence of
the 8th nerve, which precludes cochlear implantation.
Labyrinthitis ossificans:
Labyrinthitis ossificans is seen after meningitis. It is a condition in which the inner ear is filled with fibrotic tissue, which calcifies. It mostly affects the cochlea, but the vestibule and semicircular canals can also be involved. On the left images of a 56-year old male, who is a candidate for cochlear implantation.

Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip:

Ultrasound examination:

Radiology Departement of the Maastricht University Hospital and the Alrijne hospital in the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2017-12-01 Developmental dysplasia of the hip is a common musculoskeletal disorder in newborns. In this article we will discuss the ultrasound examination technique according to Graf.
Introduction:
Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common musculoskeletal problems in newborns. It is also known as congenital hip dysplasia, but actually this is a misnomer. It is a developmental disease. There are children who are born with normal hips who develop dysplasia (figure). In this case the child had a neuromuscular disorder which caused the hip to become dysplastic and dislocate. On the other hand there are children who are born with dysplasia of the hip that resolves spontaneously or after relatively simple treatment, e.g. a Pavlik harness (figure). So we have to realize that DDH is a dynamic disease and it is not always present at birth as suggested by the name congenital hip dysplasia. Treatment is easier and complications are less likely to occur when DDH is diagnosed early. In this case at 13 months the only sign of the former dysplasia is the delay of the femoral head to ossify. Developmental dysplasia of the hip is more common in girls especially if there has been a breech presentation or when they have a positive family history. These risk factors play a lesser role in boys. Clubfoot was thought to be a risk factor, but this no longer holds true.
Ultrasound orientation:
With ultrasound we are looking at the same anatomic structures as on the x-ray. The ultrasound images are in the coronal plane (figure). As a consequence the Graf classification of hip dysplasia is mainly based on the morphology of the iliac bone, where we look at the shape of the acetabulum, the bony and cartilaginous acetabular rim, labrum and position of the femoral head. Since ultrasound has the advantage of also displaying the cartilagenous structures, we can also look at the coverage of the femoral head by the cartilage of the acetabulum and the labrum. Because the infant is lying on its side the anatomy is displayed in a horizontal fashion instead of vertical (figure) And this is the way the ultrasound image is displayed on the screen of the ultrasound machine Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. In this video the ultrasound anatomy is shown. Here the anatomy in the coronal plane.
Examination technique:
A lineair, high frequency probe is used. The focus is set at the acetabular edge. It is important to display an image in the coronal plane at the level of the triradiate cartilage, which is the synchondrosis between the iliac, ischial and pubic bones which form the acetabulum. This is shown in the video. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Instability:
Sometimes in very displastic hips the use of a convex transducer can be of help.
Measurements:
First three points of interest need to be indentified in the image: Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. In this video you'll see proper measurement after placement of the three points of interest. When you perform the ultrasound examination, make sure that these three points can be identified on the image.
Graf's classification:
This is the Graf classification - short version. The alpha-angle, which is a measurement of the bony roof of the acetabulum, mainly determines the hip type. Actually, for classification purposes the beta angle is only used to differentiate between type Ia and Ib (both normal hips) and between type IIc and type D) This is the Graf classification - long version. Another important factor is the age of the child. Up to the age of 3 months (13 weeks) an alpha angle below 60 degrees is acceptable. A neonate can even start with an alpha angle of 50 degrees provided that the angle gradually reaches the 60 degrees by the age of 12 weeks. At the age of 3 months the decision has to be made whether the hip is normal or not. Evidently if a neonate starts with an alpha angle of 60 degrees than everything is o.k. and no follow up is necessary.
Type I:
Type I hips have an alpha angle of more than 60 degrees and are normal. Although there is a distinction between type Ia and Ib this is not clinically relevant. Type Ia This examination shows a good morphology of the bony acetabular roof with a sharp angular bony rim. No problem here in depicting the lateral rim of the bony roof of the acetabulum. There is nice coverage of the femoral head by the cartilaginous roof and the labrum. The alpha angle is above the 60 degrees and the beta-angle is way below 55 degrees. Type Ib This is also a normal hip. There is good coverage of the femoral head. The only difference with the type Ia-hip is a blunted bony rim. As a result the alpha-angle will be a little bit steeper than in type Ia, but still within a normal range. The beta angle is 61º, i.e more than 55º. These hips are normal and follow up is not needed.
Type II:
Type IIaIf a child is less than 3 months old, then an alpha angle of 50-59 degrees is considered an immature hip. At the age of 6-13 weeks a distinction is made whether it is thought that the immature hip develops apropriate according to age (IIa+) or inappropriate (IIa-) Type IIa+ The maturation process of type IIa+ hip is still within acceptable limits for age according to the table. Type IIa-A type IIa- hip is at risk to develop dysplasia. So an alpha angle of 56 degrees at the age of 7 weeks is called type IIa+, while at the age of 10 weeks it is called a type IIa-. Type IIb If a child is older than 3 months or 13 weeks, then an alpha angle of 50-59 degrees is considered a sign of dysplasia, i.e type IIb. Type IIa Here we see a hip with an alpha-angle of 55º. The bony acetabular roof is less well-formed and there is a rounded acetabular bony rim. The age of the child is 4 weeks, so we call this a type IIa. About 90 % of newborns with Graf type IIa hips do not develop DDH. Type IIa(+) At the age of 6 weeks the same findings result in a type IIa(+). Type IIb At the age of 3 months or 13 weeks the same findings result in a type IIb-hip. Type IIc Here a type IIc hip. The bony acetabular roof is severely deficient with a rounded to almost flat bony rim. The alpha angle is 46 degrees. The femoral head is still covered by the cartilaginous roof and the labrum.
Type D:
A type D hip is much like a type IIC hip, but the main difference is a decentring hip with a displaced cartilage roof.
Type III:
In type III hips the femoral head dislocated. The labrum is moved upwards.
Type IV:
In Graf type IV there is a severe dislocation of the femoral head which obscures most of the bony roof. The cartilaginous roof is compressed between the femoral head and the bony acetabular rim. The labrum is dislocated downwards and interposed between the femoral head and the lateral acetabular edge.

Bi-RADS for Mammography and Ultrasound 2013:

Updated version:
Harmien Zonderland and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Academical Medical Centre in Amsterdam and the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2014-10-08 This article is a summary of the BI-RADS Atlas 2013 for mammography and ultrasound. It is an updated version of the 2005 article. Since 2000 BI-RADS is required in the Netherlands, as described in the updated Guideline breast cancer 2012 (6). The application of BI-RADS is part of the national quality assessment program. We encourage anyone who is involved in breast imaging to order the illustrated atlas to get a full knowledge of BI-RADS edition 2013.
Introduction:
The ACR BI-RADS Atlas 2013 (4) is the updated version of the 2003 Atlas. BI-RADS® is designed to standardize breast imaging reporting and to reduce confusion in breast imaging interpretations. It also facilitates outcome monitoring and quality assessment. It contains a lexicon for standardized terminology (descriptors) for mammography, breast US and MRI, as well as chapters on Report Organization and Guidance Chapters for use in daily practice.
Standard Reporting:
Mention the patient's history. If Ultrasound is performed, mention if the US is targeted to a specific location or supplementary screening.
2. Describe the breast composition.
3. Describe any significant finding using standardized terminology.Use the morphological descriptors: mass, asymmetry, architectural distortion and calcifications. These findings may have associated features, like for instance a mass can be accompanied with skin thickening, nipple retraction, calcifications etc. Correlate these findings with the clinical information, mammography, US or MRI. Integrate mammography and US-findings in a single report.
4. Compare to previous studies.Awaiting previous examinations for comparison should only take place if they are required to make a final assessment
5. Conclude to a final assessment category. Use BI-RADS categories 0-6 and the phrase associated with them. If Mammography and US are performed: overall assessment should be based on the most abnormal of the two breasts, based on the highest likelihood of malignancy.
6. Give management recommendations.
7. Communicate unexpected findings with the referring clinician.Verbal discussions between radiologist, patient or referring clinician should be documented in the report.
Mammography and Ultrasound Lexicon:
The table shows a summary of the mammography and ultrasound lexicon. Enlarge the table by clicking on the image. First describe the breast composition. When there is a significant finding use the descriptors in the table. The ultrasound lexicon has many similarities to the mammography lexicon, but there are some descriptors that are specific for ultrasound. We will discuss the lexicon in more detail in a moment.

Mammography - Breast Imaging Lexicon:

Breast Composition:
In the BI-RADS edition 2003 the assignment of the breast composition was based on the overall density resulting in ACR catergory 1 ( <25% fibroglandular tissue), category 2 ( 25-50%), category 3 (50-75%) and category 4 (>75%). In BI-RADS 2013 the use of percentages is discouraged, because in individual cases it is more important to take into account the chance that a mass can be obscured by fibroglandular tissue than the percentage of breast density as an indicator for breast cancer risk. In the BI-RADS edition 2013 the assignment of the breast composition is changed into a, b, c and d-categories followed by a description: The term density describes the degree of x-ray attenuation of breast tissue but not discrete mammographic findings.
* c- The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses. Some areas in the breasts are sufficiently dense to obscure small masses.
* d
- The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography. Notice in the left example the composition is c - heterogeneously dense, although the volume of fibroglandular tissue is less than 50%. The fibroglandular tissue in the upper part is sufficiently dense to obscure small masses. So it is called c, because small masses can be obscured. Historically this would have been called an ACR 2: 25-50% density. The example on the right has more than 50% glandular tissue and is also called composition c.
Mass:
A 'Mass' is a space occupying 3D lesion seen in two different projections. If a potential mass is seen in only a single projection it should be called a 'asymmetry' until its three-dimensionality is confirmed. The images show a fat-containing lesion with a popcorn-like calcification. All fat-containing lesions are typically benign. These image-findings are diagnostic for a hamartoma - also known as fibroadenolipoma. The shape of a mass is either round, oval or irregular. Always make sure that a mass that is found on physical examination is the same as the mass that is found with mammography or ultrasound. Location and size should be applied in any lesion, that must undergo biopsy. The margin of a lesion can be: This is a benign finding.
* Obscured or partially obscured, when the margin is hidden by superimposed fibroglandular tissue. Ultrasound can be helpful to define the margin better.
* Microlobulated. This implies a suspicious finding.
* Indistinct (historically ill-defined). This is also a suspicious finding.
* Spiculated with radiating lines from the mass is a very suspicious finding. The density of a mass is related to the expected attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular tissue. High density is associated with malignancy. It is extremely rare for breast cancer to be low density. Here multiple round circumscribed low density masses in the right breast. These were the result of lipofilling, which is transplantation of body fat to the breast. Here a hyperdense mass with an irregular shape and a spiculated margin. Notice the focal skin retraction. This was reported as BI-RADS 5 and proved to be an invasive ductal carcinoma.
Architectural distortion:
The term architectural distortion is used, when the normal architecture is distorted with no definite mass visible. This includes thin straight lines or spiculations radiating from a point, and focal retraction, distortion or straightening at the edges of the parenchyma. The differential diagnosis is scar tissue or carcinoma. Architectural distortion can also be seen as an associated feature. For instance if there is a mass that causes architectural distortion, the likelihood of malignancy is greater than in the case of a mass without distortion. Notice the distortion of the normal breast architecture on oblique view (yellow circle) and magnification view. A resection was performed and only scar tissue was found in the specimen.
Asymmetries:
Findings that represent unilateral deposits of fibroglandulair tissue not conforming to the definition of a mass. This has to be differentiated from a mass.
* Global asymmetry consisting of an asymmetry over at least one quarter of the breast and is usually a normal variant.
* Developing asymmetry new, larger and more conspicuous than on a previous examination. Here an example of a focal asymmetry seen on MLO and CC-view. Local compression views and ultrasound did not show any mass. Here an example of global asymmetry. In this patient this is not a normal variant, since there are associated features, that indicate the possibility of malignancy like skin thickening, thickened septa and subtle nipple retraction. Ultrasound (not shown) detected multiple small masses that proved to be adenocarcinoma. The PET-CT shows diffuse infiltrating carcinoma. Asymmetry versus Mass All types of asymmmetry have different border contours than true masses and also lack the conspicuity of masses. Asymmetries appear similar to other discrete areas of fibroglandulair tissue except that they are unitaleral, with no mirror-image correlate in the opposite breast. An asymmetry demonstrates concave outward borders and usually is interspersed with fat, whereas a mass demonstrates convex outward borders and appears denser in the center than at the periphery. The use of the term "density" is confusing, as the term "density" should only be used to describe the x-ray attenuation of a mass compared to an equal volume of fibroglandular tissue.
Calcifications:
In the 2003 atlas calcifications were classified by morphology and distribution either as benign, intermediate concern or high probability of malignancy. In the 2013 version the approach has changed. Since calcifications of intermediate concern and of high probability of malignancy all are being treated the same way, which usually means biopsy, it is logic to group them together. Calcifications are now either typically benign or of suspicious morphology. Within this last group the chances of malignancy are different depending on their morphology (BI-RADS 4B or 4C) and also depending on their distribution. Typically benign Skin, vascular, coarse, large rodlike, round or punctate (< 1mm), rim, dystrophic, milk of calcium and suture calcifications are typically benign. There is one exception of the rule: an isolated group of punctuate calcifications that is new, increasing, linear, or segmental in distribution, or adjacent to a known cancer can be assigned as probably benign or suspicious. Amorphous, indistinct microcalcifications Suspicious morphology Usually more conspicuous than amorphous forms and are seen to have discrete shapes, without fine linear and linear branching forms, usually < 0,5 mm.
* Fine linear or fine-linear branching (BI-RADS 4C) Thin, linear irregular calcifications, may be discontinuous, occasionally branching forms can be seen, usually < 0,5 mm. Read more on breast calcifications. Distribution of calcifications The arrangement of calcifications, the distribution, is at least as important as morphology. These descriptors are arranged according to the risk of malignancy: The 2013 edition refines the upper limit in size for grouped distribution as 2 cm (historically 1 cm) while retaining > 2 cm as the lower limit for regional distribution. Study the images and describe the calcifications. Then continue reading. The findings are: This proved to be multifocal DCIS with areas of invasive carcinoma.
Associated features:
Associated features are things that are seen in association with suspicious findings like masses, asymmetries and calcifications. Associated features play a role in the final assessment. For instance a BI-RADS 4-mass could get a BI-RADS 5 assessment if seen in association with skin retraction.
Special cases:
Special cases are findings with features so typical that you do not need to describe them in detail, like for instance an intramammary lymph node or a wart on the skin.
Ultrasound - Breast Imaging Lexicon:
Many descriptors for ultrasound are the same as for mammography. For instance when we describe the shape or margin of a mass. Here we will focus on findings that are specific for ultrasound: Breast Composition: Mass: Echogenicity can contribute to the assessment of a lesion, together with other feature categories. Alone it has little specificity.
* Posterior features: enhancement, shadowing. Posterior features represent the attenuation characteristics of a mass with respect to its acoustic transmission, also of additional value. Alone it has little specificity. Calcifications: Associated features: Special cases - cases with a unique diagnosis or pathognomonic ultrasound appearance:
Final Assessment Categories:

BI-RADS 0:
Need Additional Imaging Evaluation and/or Prior Mammograms For Comparison: Category 0 or BI-RADS 0 is utilized when further imaging evaluation (e.g. additional views or ultrasound) or retrieval of prior examinations is required. When additional imaging studies are completed, a final assessment is made. Always try to avoid this category by immediately doing additional imaging or retrieving old films before reporting. Even better to have the old examinations before starting the examination. This patient presented with a mass on the mammogram at screening, which was assigned as BI-RADS 0 (needs additional imaging evaluation). Additional ultrasound demonstrated that the mass was caused by an intramammary lymph node. The final assessment is BI-RADS 2 (benign finding). Don't forget to mention in the report that the lymph node on US corresponds with the noncalcified mass on mammography. In the paragraph on location we will discuss how we can be sure that the lymph node that we found with ultrasound is indeed the same as the mammographic mass. DO DON'T
BI-RADS 1:
Negative: There is nothing to comment on. The breasts are symmetric and no masses, architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications are present. BI-RADS 1 (normal). There is nothing to comment on. BI-RADS 1 DO
BI-RADS 2:
Benign Finding: Like BI-RADS 1, this is a normal assessment, but here, the interpreter chooses to describe a benign finding in the mammography report, like: BI-RADS Category 2: Mass seen on mammogram proved to be a cyst. BI-RADS 2 DO DON'T
BI-RADS 3:
**Probably Benign Finding Initial Short-Interval Follow-Up Suggested:** A finding placed in this category should have less than a 2% risk of malignancy. It is not expected to change over the follow-up interval, but the radiologist would prefer to establish its stability. Lesions appropriately placed in this category include: Here a non-palpable sharply defined mass with a group of punctate calcifications. The mass was categorized as BI-RADS 3. Continue with follow up images. Final assessment was changed to a Category 2 Follow-up at 6, 12 and 24 months showed no change and the final assessment was changed into a Category 2. Nevertheless the patient and the clinician preferred removal, because the radiologist was not able to present a clear differential diagnosis. So add the following sentence in your report: PA: benign vascular malformation. If a BI-RADS 3 lesion shows any change during follow up, it will change into a BI-RADS 4 or 5 and biopsy should be performed. The upper image shows a few amorphous calcifications initially classified as BI-RADS 3. At 12 month follow up more than five calcifications were noted in a group. The findings were now classified as BI-RADS 4. This proved to be DCIS with invasive carcinoma. BI-RADS 3 DO Use in findings on mammography like Noncalcified circumscribed solid mass Focal asymmetry Solitary group of punctuate calcifications Use in findings on US with robust evidence to suggest Typical fibroadenoma Isolated complicated cyst Clustered microcysts DON'T
BI-RADS 4:
Suspicious Abnormality - Biopsy Should Be Considered: This category is reserved for findings that do not have the classic appearance of malignancy but are sufficiently suspicious to justify a recommendation for biopsy. BI-RADS 4 has a wide range of probability of malignancy (2 - 95%). By subdividing Category 4 into 4A, 4B and 4C , it is encouraged that relevant probabilities for malignancy be indicated within this category so the patient and her physician can make an informed decision on the ultimate course of action. DO Do use Category 4a in findings as: Partially circumscribed mass, suggestive of (atypical) fibroadenoma Palpable, solitary, complex cystic and solid cyst Probable abscess Do use Category 4b in findings as: Group amorphous or fine pleomorphic calcifications Nondescript solid mass with indistinct margins Do use Category 4c in findings as: New group of fine linear calcifications New indistinct, irregular solitary mass The CC mammographic image shows a finding, not reproducible on the MLO view. This finding is sufficiently suspicious to justify biopsy. A benign lesion, although unlikely, is a possibility. This could be for instance ectopic glandular tissue within a heterogeneously dense breast. This lesion is categorized as BI-RADS 4. Here another BI-RADS 4 abnormality. The pathologist could report to you that it is sclerosing adenosis or ductal carcinoma in situ. Both diagnoses are concordant with the mammographic findings.
BI-RADS 5:
**Highly Suggestive of Malignancy. Appropriate Action Should Be Taken:** BI-RADS 5 must be reserved for findings that are classic breast cancers, with a >95% likelihood of malignancy. The current rationale for using category 5 is that if the percutaneous tissue diagnosis is nonmalignant, this automatically should be considered as discordant. First study the images and describe the findings. Then continue reading. The findings are: This mass is categorized as BI-RADS 5. High density mass with spiculated margin BI-RADS 5 DO Then add sentence: "Biopsy should be performed in the absence of clinical contraindications". DON'T Then use Category 4c.
BI-RADS 6:
DO DON'T On the left BI-RADS 5 lesion. On the right after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy BI-RADS 6. Here images of a biopsy proven malignancy. On the initial mammogram a marker is placed in the palpable tumor. Due to the dense fibroglandular tissue the tumor is not well seen. Ultrasound demonstrated a 37 mm mass with indistinct and angular margins and shadowing. After chemotherapy the tumor is not visible on the mammogram. Ultrasound showed shrinkage of the tumor to a 18 mm mass, which was categorized as BI-RADS 6.
Location in Mammography and US:
A mass is seen in the outer lower quadrant of the left breast at 4 o' clock in the posterior portion of the breast at 4cm distance from the nipple. A complete set of location descriptors consists of: There may be variability within breast imaging practices, members of a group practice should agree upon a consistent policy for documenting. When you use more modalities, always make sure, that you are dealing with the same lesion. For instance a lesion found with US does not have to be the same as the mammographic or physical finding. Sometimes repeated mammographic imaging with markers on the lesion found with US can be helpful. Cysts can be aspirated or filled with air after aspiration to make sure that the lesion found on the mammogram is caused by a cyst. Solid lesions can be injected with contrast or a marker can be placed in difficult cases. Here images that you've seen before. They are of a patient with a new lesion found at screening. With ultrasound an intramammary lymph node was found, but we weren't sure whether this was the same as the mass on the mammogram. Continue with the mammographic images after contrast injection. Contrast was injected into the node and a repeated mammogram was performed. Here we have proof that the mass is caused by an intramammary lymph node, since the mammographic mass contains the contrast. This patient presented with a tumor in the left breast. However in the right breast a group of amorphous and fine pleomorphic calcifications was seen. Ultrasound examination was performed Ultrasound of the region demonstrated an irregular mass, which proved to be an adenocarcinoma with fine needle aspiration (FNA). To find out whether the mass was within the area of the calcifications, contrast was injected into the mass. The mass is evidently in another region of the breast. Now a vacuum assisted biopsy has to be performed of the calcifications, because maybe we are dealing with DCIS in one area and an invasive carcinoma in another area.
Size measurement:
MassLongest axis of a lesion and a second measurement at right angles. In a spiculated mass the spiculations should not be included. Architectural distortion and Asymmetries Approximation of its greatest linear dimension. Calcifications The distribution should be measured by approximation of its greatest linear dimension. Lymphnode Mammography: short axis. Ultrasound: cortical thickness.
Reporting:
Mention the patient's history. If Ultrasound is performed, mention if the US is targeted to a specific location or supplementary screening.
2. Describe the breast composition.
3. Describe any significant finding using standardized terminology.Use the morphological descriptors: mass, asymmetry, architectural distortion and calcifications. These findings may have associated features, like for instance a mass can be accompanied with skin thickening, nipple retraction, calcifications etc. Correlate these findings with the clinical information, mammography, US or MRI. Integrate mammography and US-findings in a single report.
4. Compare to previous studies.Awaiting previous examinations for comparison should only take place if they are required to make a final assessment
5. Conclude to a final assessment category.Use BI-RADS categories 0-6 and the phrase associated with them. If Mammography and US are performed: overall assessment should be based on the most abnormal of the two tests, based on the highest likelihood of malignancy.
6. Give management recommendations.
7. Communicate unsuspected findings with the referring clinician.Verbal discussions between radiologist and referring clinician should be documented in the report.
Examples of reporting:
Indication for examinationPainful mobile lump, lateral in right breast. No previous history of breast pathology. FindingsNo previous exams available. MammographyOverall breast composition: b. Scattered areas of fibroglandular density. Lateral in the right breast, concordant with the palpable lump, there is a mass with an oval shape and margin, partially circumscribed and partially obscured. The mass is equal dense compared to the fibroglandular tissue. Location: Right breast, 9 o'clock position, middle third of the breast. Size: approximation of largest diameter = 3 cm. Additional US of the mass: Concordant with the lump and the mass on the mammogram there is an oval simple cyst, parallel orientation, circumscribed, Anechoic with posterior enhancement. Size : 3,5 x 1,5 cm. In the right breast at least 2 more smaller cysts. AssessmentBI-RADS 2 (benign finding). The palpable mass is a simple cyst. There are at least two more, smaller cysts present in the right breast. Management The palpable cyst was painful, after informed consent uncomplicated puncture for suction of the cyst was performed. No indication for follow-up, unless symptoms return, as explained to the patient. Note: Indication for examination Referral from general practitioner. Mobile lump, lateral in left breast, since 2 months. No previous history of breast pathology. No previous exams available. Findings
Mammography: Overall breast composition: a. The breasts are almost entirely fatty. Lateral in the left breast, at 3 o'clock position in the posterior third of the breast, concordant with the palpable lump there is a 3 cm hyperdense mass with a rounded, but also irregular shape. The margins are partially circumscribed and partially not circumscribed with some microlobulations. Ultrasound: concordant with the lump and the mass on the mammogram there is an slightly irregular hypoechoic mass with a non-parallel orientation, > 75% circumscribed and locally indistinct margin. AssessmentBI-RADS 4a (low suspicion for malignancy). The palpable mass is concordant with a solid mass, predominantly well circumscribed. In this 35-year old patient the differential diagnosis consists of an atypical fibroadenoma or a phyllodes. ManagementAfter informed consent of the patient a 14G core needle biopsy was performed, two specimens were obtained. No complications. It was discussed with the patient and the referring general practitioner, that in case of BI-RADS 4(a) referral to the breast clinic is advised. The patient and the referring general practitioner preferred to await the results of the biopsy . AddendumThe biopsy showed a fibro-epithelial lesion, probably a benign phyllodes. Referral to the breast clinic was now strongly indicated and was put in motion by the general practitioner after telephone consultation. Diagnosis after excision: 3 cm highly cellular fibroadenoma.

Systematic Approach to Brain Tumors:
Robin Smithuis and Walter Montanera
Radiology Department of the Alrijne hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands and the Division of Neuroradiology of the St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Canada:
Publicationdate 2008-07-02 This review is based on a presentation given by Walter Montanera and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant  by Robin Smithuis. In this review a systematic approach for the analysis of a possible brain tumor is described.
Introduction:
When we analyze a potential brain tumor, there are many questions that need to be answered. Since different tumors occur in different age groups we first of all need to know the age of the patient. Next we need to know where the lesion is located - is it intra- or extra-axial and in what anatomical compartment does it lie? Is it located in the sellar or pontocerebellar region for example? Is it a solitary mass or is there multi-focal disease? On CT and MR we look for tissue characteristics like calcifications, fat, cystic components, contrast enhancement and signal intensity on T1WI, T2WI and DWI. Most brain tumors are of low signal intensity on T1WI and high on T2WI. Therefore high signal intensity on T1WI or low signal on T2WI can be an important clue to the diagnosis. Finally we have to consider the possibility that we are dealing with a lesion that simulates a tumor - like an abscess, MS-plaque, vascular malformation, aneurysm or an infarct with luxury perfusion.
Incidence of CNS tumors:
Roughly one-third of CNS tumors are metastatic lesions, one third are gliomas and one-third is of non-glial origin. Glioma is a non-specific term indicating that the tumor originates from glial cells like astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal and choroid plexus cells. Astrocytoma is the most common glioma and can be subdivided into the low-grade pilocytic type, the intermediate anaplastic type and the high grade
malignant glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM is the most common type (50% of all astrocytomas). The non-glial cel tumors are a large heterogenous group of tumors of which meningioma is the most common. Note: since the publication of this article, these numbers have changed and metastases now outnumber the primary brain tumors and are increasing in incidence as overall cancer survival improves.
Age distribution:
The age of the patient is an important factor for the differential diagnosis. Specific tumors occur under the age of 2, like choroid plexus papillomas, anaplastic astrocytomas and teratomas. In the first decade medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, ependymomas, craniopharyngeomas and gliomas are most common, while metastases are very rare. When they do occur at this age, metastases of a neuroblastoma are the most frequent. In adults about 50% of all CNS lesions are metastases. Other common tumors in adults are astrocytomas, glioblastoma multiforme, meningiomas, oligodendrogliomas, pituitary adenomas and schwannomas. Astrocytomas occur at any age, but glioblastoma multiforme is mostly seen in older people. Although cancer is rare in children, brain tumors are the most common type of childhood cancer after leukemia and lymphoma. Most of the tumors in children are located infratentorially. The most common supra- and infratentorial tumors are listed in the table on the left. The most common tumors in adults are listed in the table on the left. Note that metastases are by far the most common. It is important to realize that 50% of metastases are solitary. Particularly in the posterior fossa, metastases should be in the top 3 of the differential diagnostic list. Hemangioblastoma is an uncommon tumor, but it is the most common primary intra-axial tumor in the adult. Supratentorially, metastases are also the most common tumors, followed by gliomas.
Tumor spread:

Intra- versus Extraaxial:
When we study an intracranial mass, the first thing we want to know is whether the mass lies in- or outside of the brain. If it is outside the brain or extra-axial, then the lesion is not actually a brain tumor, but derived from the lining of the brain or surrounding structures. Eighty percent of these extra-axial lesions will be either a meningioma or a schwannoma. On the other hand, in an adult an intra-axial tumor will be a metastasis or astrocytoma in 75% of cases. Schwannoma in CPA-region with typical features of an extraaxial tumor (T2WI) The T2W-images show a schwannoma located in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). This case nicely demonstrates the typical signs of an extra-axial tumor. There is a CSF cleft (yellow arrow). The subarachnoid vessels that run on the surface of the brain are displaced by the lesion (blue arrow). There is gray matter between the lesion and the white matter (curved red arrow). The subarachnoid space is widened because growth of an extra-axial lesion tends to push away the brain. All these signs indicate that this is a typical extra-axial tumor. In the region of the CPA 90% of the extra-axial tumors are schwannomas. Coronal enhanced T1WI. Meningioma with dural tail, hyperostosis of adjacent bone and homogeneous enhancement Another sign of an extra-axial origin is a broad dural base or a dural tail of enhancement as is typically seen in meningiomas. This may also occur in other extra-axial tumors, but it is less common. Another sign of an extra-axial origin are bony changes. Bony changes are seen in bone tumors like chordomas, chondrosarcomas and metastases. They can also be secondary, as is seen in meningiomas and other tumors. On the left an example of a meningioma with a broad dural base and a dural tail of enhancement. There is hyperostosis in the adjacent bone and the lesion enhances homogeneously. Extra-axial tumors are not derived from brain tissue and do not have a blood-brain-barrier, so most of them enhance homogeneously. Melanoma metastasis: T2WI and T1WI Intra- vs Extra-axial (2) The differentiation between intra-axial versus extra-axial is usually straight forward, but sometimes it can be very difficult and imaging in multiple planes may be necessary. The tumor in the case on the left was thought to be a falcine meningioma, i.e. extra-axial and was presented for surgery. This lesion surely has the appearance of a meningioma: these tumors can be hypointense on T2 due to a fibrocollageneous matrix or calcifications and frequently produce reactive edema in the adjacent white matter of the brain. However, there is gray matter on the anteromedial and posteromedial side of the lesion (red arrow). This indicates that the lesion is intra-axial. If the lesion was extra-axial the gray matter should have been pushed away. This proved to be a melanoma metastasis. Ependymoma with extension to the prepontine area (blue arrows) and into the foramen magnum (red arrow). Local tumor spread (1) Astrocytomas spread along the white matter tracts and do not respect the bounderies of the lobes. Because of this infiltrative growth, in many cases the tumor is actually larger than can be depicted with MR. Ependymomas of the fourth ventricle in children tend to extend through the foramen of Magendie to the cisterna magna and through the lateral foramina of Luschka to the cerebellopontine angle (figure). Oligodendrogliomas typically show extension to the cortex. Subarachnoid seeding Some tumors show subarachnoid seeding and form tumoral nodules along the brain and spinal cord. This is seen in PNET, ependymomas, GBMs, lymphomas, oligodendrogliomas and choroid plexus papillomas. Primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET) form a rare group of tumors, which develop from primitive or undifferentiated nerve cells. These include medulloblastomas and pineoblastomas. One of the most important roles of imaging is to assess the extent of a tumor. This is shown in the case on the left in a patient who presented with multiple cranial nerve abnormalities. On the images we see an extra-axial tumor in the region of the left cavernous sinus. There is homogeneous enhancement with a broad dural tail. This is typical for a meningioma. Only by studying all the images we do appreciate that the actual extent of the tumor is greater than expected. The tumor is situated in the pterygopalatine fossa and extends into the orbit. It also spreads anteriorly into the middle cranial fossa Low grade astrocytoma Local tumor spread (2) Another important consideration is the effect on the surrounding structures. Primary brain tumors are derived from brain cells and often have less mass effect for their size than you would expect, due to their infiltrative growth. This is not the case with metastases and extra-axial tumors like meningiomas or schwannomas, which have more mass effect due to their expansive growth. On the left is an image of a diffusely infiltrating intra-axial tumor occupying most of the right hemisphere with only a minimal mass effect. This is typical for the infiltrative growth seen in primary brain tumors. There is no enhancement so this would probably be a low-grade astrocytoma. Tumors and tumor-like masses that cross the midline
Midline crossing:
The ability of tumors to cross the midline limits the differential diagnosis. LEFT: Metastases. RIGHT: Multiple meningiomas and a schwannoma in a patient with Neurofibromatosis II
Multifocal disease:
Multiple tumors in the brain usually indicate metastatic disease (figure). Primary brain tumors are typically seen in a single region, but some brain tumors like lymphomas, multicentric glioblastomas and gliomatosis cerebri can be multifocal. Some tumors can be multifocal as a result of seeding metastases: this can occur in medulloblastomas (PNET-MB), ependymomas, GBMs and oligodendrogliomas. Meningiomas and schwannomas can be multiple, especially in neurofibromatosis type II. Multiple brain tumors can be seen in phacomatoses: Many non-tumorous diseases like small vessel disease, infections (septic emboli, abscesses) or demyelinating diseases like MS can also present as multifocal disease.
Cortical based tumors:
Most intra-axial tumors are located in the white matter. Some tumors, however, spread to or are located in the gray matter. The differential diagnosis for these cortical based tumors includes oligodendroglioma, ganglioglioma and Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithial Tumor (DNET). A DNET is a rare benign neoplasm, usually in a cortical and temporal location. Patients with a cortically based tumor usually present with complex seizures. On the left a 45-year-old female with a stable seizure disorder (complex-partial) for 15 years. There is a non-enhancing, cortically based tumor. This is a ganglioglioma. The differential diagnosis includes DNET and pilocytic astrocytoma. These cortically based tumors have to be differentiated from non-tumorous lesions like cerebritis, herpes simplex encephalitis, infarction and post-ictal changes. On the left are images of a 52-year-old female who, over the period of one year, complained of headache and neck pain. There is a recent onset of tonic-clonic seizures. The CT shows a mass with calcifications, which extends all the way to the cortex. Although this is a large tumor there is only limited mass effect on surrounding structures, which indicates that this is an infiltrating tumor. The most likely diagnosis is oligodendroglioma. The differential diagnosis includes a malignant astrocytoma or a glioblastoma.
CT and MR Characteristics:
Ruptured dermoid cyst. Coronal T1WI (left) and NECT (right).
Fat - Calcification - Cyst - High density:
Fat has a low density on CT (- 100HU). On MR, fat has a high signal intensity on both T1- and T2WI. On sequences with fat suppression fat can be differentiated from high signal caused by subacute hematoma, melanin, slow flow etc. When you see high signal on T1WI always look for chemical shift artefact, as this indicates the presence of fat. The chemical shift artefact occurs as alternating bands of high and low signal on the boundaries of a lesion and is seen only in the frequency encoding direction. Fat within a tumor is seen in lipomas, dermoid cysts and teratomas. On the left a patient with the classical findings of a ruptured dermoid cyst. Some tumors can have a high density on CT. This is typically seen in lymphoma, colloid cyst and PNET-MB (medulloblastoma). Calcification Calcification is seen in many CNS tumors (Table). When we think of a calcified intra-axial tumor, we think oligodendroglioma since these tumors nearly always have calcifications. However an intraaxial calcified tumor in the brain is more likely to be an astrocytoma than a oligodendrogliomas, since astrocytomas, although less frequently calcified, are far more common. A pineocytoma itself does not calcify, but instead it 'explodes' the calcifications of the pineal gland. On the left is an image of a calcified mass in the suprasellar region, causing obstructive hydrocephalus. This location in the suprasellar region and the calcification are typical for a craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngiomas are slow growing, extra-axial, squamous epithelial, calcified, cystic tumors arising from remnants of Rathke's cleft. They are located the (supra)sellar region and primarily seen in children with a small second peak incidence in older adults. Oligodendroglioma with calcification (PDWI and CT) On the left are images of a tumor with a small calcification. . The calcification is not appreciated on the MR images, but is easily seen on CT. The calcification and the extension of the tumor to the cortex are very typical for an oligodendroglioma. An astrocytoma should be in the differential. Calcified meningioma On the left are images of a patient with progressive visual loss. On the coronal and sagittal TW1I there is a large mass centered around the sella with a broad dural base. There is extension into the sella. This patient was booked for decompression. Only after the CT was performed, was it appreciated how densely calcified this tumor is. It would be impossible to operate this tumor and preserve the patient's vision. Cystic versus Solid There are many cystic lesions that can simulate a CNS tumor. These include epidermoid, dermoid, arachnoid, neuroenteric and neuroglial cysts. Even enlarged perivascular spaces of Virchow Robin can simulate a tumor. In order to determine whether a lesion is a cyst or cystic mass look for the following characteristics: An arachnoid cyst is isointense to CSF on all sequences. Tumor necrosis may sometimes look like a cyst, but it is never completely isointense to CSF. On the far left a craniopharyngioma with an enhancing rim surrounding the cystic component. In the middle a neuroenteric cyst with the contents of which have the same signal intensity as CSF. On the right a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with a central cystic component. The enhancement in GBM is usually more irregular.
High on T1:
Most tumors have a low or intermediate signal intensity on T1WI. Exceptions to this rule can indicate a specific type of tumor. On the left is a list of causes for T1-shortening. Calcifications are mostly dark on T1WI, but depending on the matrix of the calcifications they can sometimes be bright on T1. Especially on gradient echo images slow flow can be seen as bright signal on T1WI and should not be confused with enhancement. This is particularly pronounced on gradient echo images. If you only do an enhanced scan, remember that high signal is not always enhancement. On the left are some images of tumors with high signal intensities on T1WI. On the far left images of a patient who presented with apoplexy. The high signal is due to hemorrhage in a pituitary macroadenoma. The patient in the middle has a glioblastoma multiforme, which caused a hemorrhage in the splenium of the corpus callosum. On the right is a patient with a metastasis of a melanoma. The high signal intensity is due to the melanin content.
Low on T2:
Most tumors will be bright on T2WI due to a high water content. When tumors have a low water content they are very dense and hypercellular and the cells have a high nuclear-cytoplasmasmic ratio. These tumors will be dark on T2WI. The classic examples are CNS lymphoma and PNET (also hyperdense on CT). Calcifications are mostly dark on T2WI. The differential diagnosis of calcified tumors was discussed above. Paramagnetic effects cause a signal drop and are seen in tumors that contain hemosiderin. Proteinaceous material can be dark on T2 depending on the content of the protein itself. A classic example of this is the colloid cyst. Flow voids are also dark on T2 and indicate the presence of vessels or flow within a lesion. This is seen in tumors that contain a lot of vessels like hemangioblastomas, but also in non-tumorous lesions like vascular malformations. On the left some examples of tumors with a low signal intensity on T2WI. They can have a high SI on T2WI if they contain a lot of water. They can have a low SI on T2WI if they are very dense and hypercellular or when they contain calcifications.
Diffusion weighted imaging:
Normally water protons have the ability to diffuse extracellularly and loose signal. High intensity on DWI indicates restriction of the ability of water protons to diffuse extracellularly. Restricted diffusion is seen in abscesses, epidermoid cysts and acute infarction (due to cytotoxic edema). In cerebral abscesses the diffusion is probably restricted due to the viscosity of pus, resulting in a high signal on DWI. In most tumors there is no restricted diffusion - even in necrotic or cystic components. This results in a normal, low signal on DWI.
Perfusion Imaging:
Perfusion imaging can play an important role in determining the malignancy grade of a CNS tumor. Perfusion depends on the vascularity of a tumor and is not dependent on the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. The amount of perfusion shows a better correlation with the grade of malignancy of a tumor than the amount of contrast enhancement.
Enhancement:
Blood brain barrier The brain has a unique triple layered blood-brain barrier (BBB) with tight endothelial junctions in order to maintain a consistent internal milieu. Contrast will not leak into the brain unless this barrier is damaged. Enhancement is seen when a CNS tumor destroys the BBB. Extra-axial tumors such as meningiomas and schwannomas are not derived from brain cells and do not have a blood-brain barrier. Therefore they will enhance. There is also no blood-brain barrier in the pituitary, pineal and choroid plexus regions. Some non-tumoral lesions enhance because they can also break down the BBB and may simulate a brain tumor. These lesions include like infections, demyelinating diseases (MS) and infarctions. Contrast enhancement cannot visualize the full extent of a tumor in cases of infiltrating tumors, like gliomas. The reason for this is that tumor cells blend with the normal brain parenchyma where the blood brain barrier is still intact. Tumor cells can be found beyond the enhancing margins of the tumor and beyond any MR signal alteration - even beyond the area of edema. On the left is an image of a 42 y/o male with mild head trauma. On the T2WI there is a lesion in the left temporal lobe, found incidentally. There was no enhancement and the DWI was normal. During follow-up there was a slight increase in size. This was diagnosed as a low-grade astrocytoma. It is not possible to resect such a lesion, since the infiltrating tumors cells are within the normal-appearing brain tissue. Low grade tumors with enhancement: ganglioglioma (left) and a pilocytic astrocytoma (right) In gliomas - like astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and glioblastoma multiforme - enhancement usually indicates a higher degree of malignancy. Therefore when during the follow up of a low-grade glioma the tumor starts to enhance, it is a sign of malignant transformation.. Gangliogliomas and pilocytic astrocytomas are the exceptions to this rule: they are low-grade tumors, but they enhance vividly. As discussed above, it recently has been shown that tumor angiogenesis as shown by perfusion MR correlates better with tumor grade than enhancement after the administration of intravenous contrast. LEFT: Schwannoma extending into the middle cranial fossa with homogeneous enhancement RIGHT: Primary Lymphoma known for its vivid enhancement The amount of enhancement depends on the amount of contrast that is delivered to the interstitium. In general, the longer we wait, the better the interstitial enhancement will be. The optimal timing is about 30 minutes and it is better to give contrast at the start of the examination and to do the enhanced T1WI at the end. Low grade astrocytoma. No enhancement. No enhancement is seen in: On the left is an image of an intra-axial tumor in an adult. It is centered in the temporal lobe and involves the cortex. Although there is massive infiltrative growth involving a large part of the right cerebral hemisphere, there is only minimal mass effect. There is no enhancement. These features are typical for a low-grade astrocytoma. Homogeneous enhancement can be seen in: GBM with patchy enhancement and cystic component with ring enhancement Patchy enhancement can be seen in: On the left is an example of a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The enhancement indicates that this is a high-grade tumor, but only parts of it enhance. Notice that there is also a cystic component with ring enhancement. The tumor cells probably extend beyond the area of edema as seen on the FLAIR image. This is because gliomas grow infiltratively into normal brain - initially without any MR changes. Patchy enhancement (2) On the left are images of a tumor located in the right hemisphere. Although is a large tumor, the mass-effect is limited. This indicates that there is marked infiltrative growth, a characteristic typical for gliomas. Notice the heterogeneity on both T2WI and FLAIR. There is patchy enhancement. All these findings are typical for a GBM. Virtually no other tumor behaves in this way. Ring enhancement Ring enhancement is seen in metastases and high-grade gliomas. It is also seen in non-tumorous lesions like abscesses, some MS-plaques and sometimes in an old hematomas. On the left three different ring enhancing lesions. Conspicuity of tumors with contrast The case on the left demonstrates the value of Gadolinium in the conspicuity of tumors. This is a patient with Neurofibromatosis II. After the administration of contrast the two meningiomas and the schwannoma are easily seen. Leptomeningeal metastases Leptomeningeal metastases are usually not seen without the administration of intravenous contrast. The case on the left demonstrates the abnormal enhancement along the brainstem, along the folia of the cerebellum (yellow arrow) and along the fifth intracranial nerve (blue arrow) in a patient with leptomeningeal metastases.
Differential diagnosis for specific anatomic area:

Skull base:
Common skull base tumors are listed in the table on the left. These tumors either arise from extracranial structures like the sinuses (sinonasal carcinoma), or from the skull base itself (chordoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrous dysplasia). Chordoma is usually located in the midline, while chondrasarcoma usually arises off the midline. On the left a midline tumor arising from the clivus. This is the typical presentation of a chordoma. The differential diagnosis would include a metastasis and a chondrosarcoma. On the left another skull base tumor located off midline. This is a typical presentation for a chondrosarcoma. The differential diagnosis would include a metastasis and a paraganglioma. Chondrosarcomas can be located in the midline and chordomas are sometimes located off midline but those cases are exceptional. On the left an example of a Skull Base Paraganglioma. On the left CT images of a 58-year-old male with a gradual onset of right facial pain and numbness and a recent onset of double vision. First study the images, than continue. There is an enhancing mass anterior to the skull base and also in the region of the right cavernous sinus. In the bone window setting there is sclerosis of the skull base, particularly in the region of the clivus. Continue with the MR images. On the left enhanced sagittal and coronal T1WI. The most striking finding is the black clivus due to the sclerosis. A normal clivus is bright on T1WI as a result of the fatty bone marrow. There is an enhancing mass anterior to the clivus. On the coronal images we see the enhancement extending through the foramen ovale to the right of the cavernous sinus. The diagnosis is a nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with intracranial extension. The differential diagnosis would include: skull base metastasis, lymphoma, chronic infection and even a meningioma - although this would be an unusual way for a meningioma to spread.
Sella/suprasellar:
On the left is a list of common sellar and suprasellar tumors. In this region it is important to keep the possibility of an aneurysm in the differential diagnosis. On the left are images of a mass in the suprasellar cistern. On the NECT we can see that it contains calcium. On the T1WI there is a hyperintense area that shows no enhancement (i.e. cystic). There are other components that show enhancement. The tumor is complicated by a hydrocephalus. These findings are very specific for a craniopharyngeoma. On the left NECT and enhanced CT-images of a 33-year-old female with severe headache (worse in the a.m.), reduction in visual acuity and visual fields and papilledema. Continue with the MR images. Notice the normal inferiorly displaced pituitary gland. This means it is not a macroadenoma. The diagnosis is again a craniopharyngioma. The differential diagnosis would include an astrocytoma and a meningioma.
Cerebello-pontine angle:
Common CP Angle Tumors are listed in the table on the left. On the left a 52-year-old male with hearing loss on the right. The images show an unusual cystic mass with enhancing septations. There is also some enhancement within the internal acoustic canal. Based on the images the most likely diagnosis would be a cystic schwannoma, but this happened to be an uncommon, cystic presentation of a meningioma.
Pineal region:
Common pineal region tumors are listed in the table on the left. On the left a tumor located in the pineal region. Based on these images the differential diagnosis would include: This happened to be a meningioma. On the left are typical images of a ruptured pineal region dermoid. On the left images of a 12 y/o male with upward gaze paralysis. There is a tumor located in the pineal region. The tumor contains calcifications. There is homogeneous enhancement, which is common for a tumor in the pineal region (discussed above). Based on the age of the patient, the location and the tumor characteristics, this is most likely a germinoma.
Intraventricular:
Common intraventricular Tumors are listed in the table on the left. On the left a tumor located in the 3rd ventricle. The tumor contains calcifications. The diagnosis is a giant cell astrocytoma.
4th ventricle:
In children tumors in the 4th ventricle are very common. Astrocytomas are the most common followed by medulloblastomas (or PNET-MB), ependymomas and brainstem gliomas with a dorsal exophytic component. In adults tumors in the 4th ventricle are uncommon. Metastases are most frequently seen, followed by hemangioblastomas, choroid plexus papillomas and dermoid and epidermoid cysts.
Tumor Mimics:
Many non-tumorous lesions can mimic a brain tumor. Abscesses can mimic metastases. Multiple sclerosis can present with a mass-like lesion with enhancement, also known as tumefactive multiple sclerosis.. In the parasellar region one should always consider the possibility of a aneurysm. Infections and vascular lesions can also mimic a CNS tumor.

Closed Loop Obstruction with video:
Robin Smithuis
the Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2017-04-22 The most important diagnosis an abdominal radiologist can make is 'Closed Loop Obstruction'. Making this diagnosis can sometimes save the patient's life. Preferably, the radiologist should state in every CT-report of a patient with small bowel obstruction whether it is a simple obstruction - which usually has a good prognosis - or a closed loop obstruction, in which case emergency surgery is necessary. In this video article, we will combine text and videos to illustrate the findings of closed loop obstruction on CT and in the OR.
Introduction:

Small Bowel Obstruction and Closed Loop:
Ileus is usually the result of a small bowel obstruction (SBO). In most cases this caused by adhesions, even in patients without prior surgery. An adhesion can cause a simple obstruction; in these cases, we see a change in caliber of the bowel and both the dilated bowel and the collapsed bowel have a normal vascularization. In closed loop obstruction, the small bowel is obstructed at two points along its course, thus forming a closed loop. These patients have a high risk of bowel ischemia due to venous infarction, which will result in perforation, septic shock and other complications with a high mortality rate. In this video, we have two patients with a small bowel obstruction.
The patient on the left has a simple obstruction at only one point.
The patient on the right however, has a second obstruction caused by the same adhesion.
This second obstruction is more proximal and usually difficult to detect, because both the closed loop as well as the small bowel proximal to this second obstruction are dilated. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Why is closed loop a difficult diagnosis?:
This video taken in the OR demonstrates how difficult it is for the surgeon to inspect the abdomen in a patient with a closed loop obstruction.
In many cases the surgeon will not make the diagnosis of closed loop obstruction. So, if you as a radiologist do not make the diagnosis, and the surgeon doesn't make the diagnosis, you will both not know what you have missed. When the radiologist tells the surgeon that there is a small bowel obstruction, probably due to an adhesion, and misses the diagnosis of a closed loop obstruction, there is a good chance that the surgeon - after resecting 2 meters of necrotic bowel two days later - will say to the radiologist.... 'yeah, you were right'. Here the axial and coronal CT images. Closed loop obstruction is hard to diagnose on CT because it looks like a simple obstruction caused by an adhesion. You look for a change in caliber of the bowel and once you have found it, you think that the job is done. Look for an odd position of a group of small bowel loops with mesenteric edema and go for the second obstruction. The video of the coronal reconstructions better shows the closed loop as well as the two points of obstruction in one plane.
Radiological signs of Closed loop obstruction:
The most important signs of a closed loop obstruction on CT are: The bowel loops have a strange arrangement. In most cases, this is due to adhesions, but sometimes due to internal herniation.
2. Mesenteric edema This is edema only on the mesenteric side of the bowel, the result of venous obstruction. Some call this 'wet ischemia' (unlike dry ischemia, which is seen in arterial ischemia).
3. Two points of obstruction This is the ultimate proof of a closed loop obstruction. Other signs that can be seen in patients with closed loop obstruction are: Odd configuration of small bowel loops in patients with a closed loop obstruction
Odd configuration of small bowel loops:
Look for a strange configuration of small bowel loops clumped together. Sometimes it looks like a volvulus. This is not that strange, since actually a volvulus is a closed loop obstruction of the large bowel. In the large bowel this hardly ever leads to ischemia; unlike a closed loop obstruction of the small bowel. Mesenteric edema
Mesenteric edema:
Mesenteric edema is the result of venous obstruction due to strangulation. It is only seen on the mesenteric side of the bowel, unlike the circumferential edema in enteritis or Crohn's disease. Here is a video of a patient with closed loop obstruction demonstrating mesenteric edema. Try to find the mesenteric edema before the green arrow does.
Two points of obstruction:
Although an odd configuration of bowel loops and mesenteric edema in a patient with a small bowel obstruction are probably a good indication for surgery, finding two points of obstruction will give you 100% confidence in diagnosing a closed loop obstruction. The two points of obstruction are always within 2 cm of each other so you don't have to look far, but they can be in any plane, so you need reconstructions. The video shows you the images without comment first. Try to find the closed loop with the two points of obstruction. Then continue the video with commentary.
CT protocol:

i.v. contrast:
Good enhancement of the bowel wall will help you to track the bowel and to find the two stenoses. Sometimes it even helps you to make the diagnosis of ischemia when there is a difference in enhancement. Optimal enhancement of the bowel is in the late arterial phase and starts at about 15-20 seconds after enhancement of the abdominal aorta. A flow of 5cc/sec will give a good peak of enhancement in the aorta and thus also in the bowel (see figure). Do not scan in the portal venous phase, because most of the contrast will be gone. Unfortunately, some of the patients with a closed loop obstruction are dehydrated.
Need for reconstructions:
In order to find the two stenoses you need reconstructions. Some closed loops are obvious on axial images, but sometimes reconstructions in multiple planes are necessary. In this video, we demonstrate the importance of reconstructions.
Oral contrast:
There are two main reasons to not give oral contrast: In my opinion there is almost never a reason to give a patient oral contrast for CT scanning.
Adhesions at surgery:
Most closed loop obstructions are the result of adhesions - even in patients without a history of prior abdominal surgery.
Is there always dilatation of bowel?:
Of course, the answer to this question is no. The dilatation of the small bowel proximal to the closed loop and the dilatation within the closed loop depend on the amount of obstruction at the two stenoses and the time before the patient gets to CT and surgery. In most cases both the proximal bowel and the closed loop are dilated, but sometimes there is only dilatation of the proximal bowel or only of the closed loop. When the obstruction is very acute and there is no time delay, the bowel may not be dilated at all, which can make the diagnosis difficult. Watch the next video... This is a patient without prior surgery who presented at the ER with acute abdominal pain for two hours. This patient has a closed loop obstruction. Notice that there is no dilatation of the small bowel, both on CT and at surgery. After cleavage of the adhesion the bowel was placed back into the abdomen and re-inspected after 10 minutes. The 1.5 meter of ischemic bowel had regained a normal color. This patient left the hospital the following day, in good condition.
Sclerotic bone tumors:
Henk Jan van der Woude and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam and the Rijnland hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2013-11-01 In the article Bone Tumors - Differential diagnosis we discussed a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions. The differential diagnosis mostly depends on the age of the patient and the findings on the conventional radiographs. In this article we will discuss the differential diagnosis of sclerotic bone tumors and tumor-like lesions in more detail.
Introduction:
Here an illustration of the most common sclerotic bone tumors. In the table the most common sclerotic bone tumors and tumor-like lesions in different age-groups are presented. Fibrous dysplasia and eosinophilic granuloma more commonly present as osteolytic lesions, but they can be sclerotic. Notice that many benign osteolytic lesions that are frequently seen in younger age groups may heal and appear as sclerotic lesions in the middle aged group. Infection is seen in all ages. Particularly chronic osteomyelitis may have a sclerotic appearance. Another approach to the differential diagnosis of sclerotic bone lesions is to use the mnemonic I VINDICATE, which means 'I clear myself from accusation'. The mnemonic I VINDICATE is a commonly used mnemonic for the differential diagnostis of any radiological lesion.
Bone infarction:
Multiple bone infarcts Key facts The term bone infarction is used for osteonecrosis within the diaphysis or metaphysis. If the osteonecrosis is located in the epiphysis, the term avascular osteonecrosis is used. The radiograph shows typical bone infarcts in diaphysis and metaphysis of femur and tibia.. On MR imaging bone infarcts are characterized by irregulair serpentiginous margins with low signal intensity on both T1 and T2 WI and with intermediate to high fat signal in the center part. Enhancement after i.v. Gadolinium is usually minimal or absent (see right image). At the periphery of the infarct a zone of relative high signal intensity on T2WI may be found. Differentiating a bone infarct from an enchondroma or low-grade chondrosarcoma on plain films can be difficult or even impossible. Cartilaginous tumors in particular chondrosarcoma may show endosteal scalloping, while a bone infarct does not. Chrondroid tumors are more frequently encountered than bone infarcts. Here a lesion in the epiphysis, which was the result of post-traumatic osteonecrosis. In the epiphysis we use the term avascular necrosis and not bone infarction.
Bone island:
Key facts Click here for more information about bone island.
Chondroblastoma:
key facts: Here a lesion located in the epi- and metaphysis of the proximal humerus. The lesion is predominantly calcified. Coronal T1W image shows lobulated margins and peripheral low SI due to the calcifications. Click here for more examples of chondroblastoma.
Chondrosarcoma:
Low-grade chondrosarcoma Key facts The image shows a calcified lesion in the proximal tibia without suspicious features. This could very well be an enchondroma. There were other features that favored the diagnosis of a low-grade chondrosarcoma like a positive bone scan and endosteal scalloping of the cortical bone on an MRI (not shown). A chondrosarcoma was diagnosed at biopsy. Here a 44-year old male with a mixed lytic and sclerotic mass arising from the fifth metacarpal bone. There are calcified strands within the soft tissues. T2-weighted axial MR image demonstrates high signal intensity of the tumor in the metacarpal bone with extension of a lobulated soft tissue mass. Diagnosis: chondrosarcoma grade 2 Here a chondrosarcoma of the left iliac bone. Because of the large dimensions with soft tissue extension on plain radiograph and axial T2-weighted MR image, a high grade chondrosarcoma was suspected. Biopsy showed grade 2 chondroarcoma. Continue with the bone scan. Intense uptake on bone scintigraphy as we would expect in high grade chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcoma in humeral head and sternum Here two other lesions in different patients that proved to be chondrosarcoma. The sclerotic lesion in the humeral head could very well be a benign enchondroma based on the imaging findings. Symptoms are usually absent, however, in adult patients with a chondroid lesion in a long bone, particularly of larger size, always consider low-grade chondrosarcoma. Plain radiograph and coronal T1-weighted contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed MR image of a mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion of the distal femoral diaphysis. Notice the homogeneous thickening of the cortical bone. There are no calcifications. The MR image shows that the lesion has lobulated contours and nodular enhancement. The homogeneous enhancement in the upper part with edema and cortical thickening are not typical for a low-grade chondrosarcoma. A high grade chondrosarcoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Biopsy revealed dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma.
Peripheral chondrosarcoma:
Key facts Consider peripheral chondrosaroma in growing osteochondromas with or without pain after closure of the physeal plate. Radiographic or CT features that suggest malignancy: Use MRI with water-sensitive sequence (T2 FS) to determine cartilage cap thickness. Consider progression of osteohondroma to chondrosarcoma when cartilage cap measures > 10 mm. Click here for more examples of chondrosarcoma.
Periosteal or juxtacortical chondrosarcoma:
A juxtacortical chondrosarcoma has be considered in the differential diagnosis when a mineralized lesion adjacent to the cortical bone is seen. Here a partially calcified mass against the proximal humerus with involvement of the cortical bone on an axial CT image. T2-weighted MR image reveals a lobulated mass with high signal intensity. The bone marrow compartment is not involved which is important for the surgical strategy. A periosteal chondroma may have the same imaging characteristics, however, these are almost always much smaller. Plain radiograph in another patient shows irreglar mineralized lesion with elevation of the periosteum and cortical involvement. On the right T2-WI with FS of same patient.. The juxtacortical mass has a high SI and lobulated contours. DD: juxtacortical chondrosarcoma, parosteal osteosarcoma.
Enchondroma:
Most commonly encountered bone tumor in the small bones of the hand and foot. Here on a radiograph the typical calcifications in the chondroid matrix of an enchondroma. Notice how easily MRI depicts these lesions. Enchondroma is a fairly common benign cartilaginaous lesion which may present as an entirely lytic lesion without any calcification, as a dense calcified lesion or as a mixed leson with osteolysis and calcifications. Enchondromas aswell as low-grade chondrosarcomas are frequently encountered as coincidental findings in patients who have a MRI or bone scan for other reasons. Click here for more examples of enchondromas.
Eosinophilic granuloma:
key facts: Eosinophilic granuloma as sclerotic lesion in the clavicle. This image is of a 20 year old patient with a sclerotic expansile lesion in the clavicle. Notice that there are small areas of ill-defined osteolysis. In an older patient one should first consider an osteoblastic metastasis. If the patient had fever and a proper clinical setting, osteomyelitis would be in the differential diagnosis. Click here for more examples of eosinophilic granuloma.
Fibrous dysplasia:
Fibrous dysplasia FD is often purely lytic, but may have a groundglass appearance as the matrix calcifies. Ossifications or calcifications can be present in variable amounts. Here a rather wel-defined eccentric lesion which is predominantly sclerotic. The differential diagnosis includes: Here a well-defined mixed sclerotic-lytic lesion of the left iliac bone. The diagnosis was fibrous dysplasia. DD: old SBC. Bone scintigraphy can be either negative or show limited uptake. The signal intensity on MR depends on the amount of calcifications and ossifications and fibrous tissue (low SI) and cystic components (high SI on T2). Fibrous dysplasia can be monostotic or polyostotic. Usually it is a lesion of childhood or young adults. Not infrequently encountered as coincidental finding at later age. Central location most common with some expansion and cortical thinning Click here for more detailed information about fibrous dysplasia.
Melorrheostosis:
Melorrheostosis is a dysplasia of the bone, characterized by apposition of mature bone on the outer or inner surface of cortical bone. Usually one bone is involved. The epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis may be involved. Usually new bone is added to one side of the cortex only. Complete envelopment may occur. Here Melorrheostosis of the ulna with the appearance of candle wax. A surface osteosarcoma could be considered in the differential diagnosis Axial T1-weighted MR image shows homogeneous low signal intensity due to the compact bone apposition. Click here for more examples.
Metastases:
key facts Here images of a patient with prostate cancer. Notice the numerous predominantly osteoblastic metastases. Here images of a patient with breast cancer. There is a metastasis, which presents as a subtle sclerotic lesion in the humerus metaphysis. This could be an osteoblastic metastasis or an osteolytic metastasis that responded to chemotherapy. Osteoblastic metastases (2) Here a radiograph of the pelvis with a barely visible osteoblastic metastasis in the left iliac bone (blue arrow). Notice that CT depicts these lesions far better (red arrows). Here CT-images of a patient with prostate cancer. Notice the numerous ill-defined osteoblastic metastases.
Non-ossifying fibroma:
Non-ossifying fibroma (NOF) can be encoutered occasionally as a partial or completely sclerotic lesion. Typically a NOF presents as an eccentric well-defined lytic lesion, usually found as a coincidental finding. These lesions usually regress spontaneously and may then become sclerotic. Other benign lesions, like solitary bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, chondroblastoma and other benign bone tumors may become inert and may also become sclerotic. The images show on the left a typical osteolytic NOF with a sharp sclerotic border. The image on the right is of a different patient who has an old NOF that shows complete fill in. Click here for more detailed information about NOF. Here an incidental finding of several eccentric sclerotic lesions of the distal femur. These are inert filled-in non-ossifying fibromas. No further examination is needed.
Osteochondroma:
Osteochondroma is a bony protrusion covered by a cartilaginous cap. Growth of the osteochondroma takes place in the cap, corresponding with normal enchondral growth at the growth plates. Accordingly, growth of osteochondromas is allowed until a patient reaches adulthood and the physeal plates are closed. Growth of osteochondromas at adult ages, which is characterized by a thick cartilaginous cap (high SI on T2WI) should raise the suspicion of progression to a peripheral chondrosarcoma. Here a patient with a broad-based osteochondroma. Notice that the cortical bone extends into the lesion. This feature differentiates it from a juxtacortical tumor. Here a patient with a broad-based osteochondroma with extension of the cortical bone into the stalk of the lesion. Notice the lytic peripheral part with subtle calcifications. This part corresponds to a zone of high SI on T2-WI with FS on the right. This represents a thick cartilage cap. This is an example of progression of an osteochondroma to a peripheral chondrosarcoma. Malignant transformation Radiographic features that should raise the suspicion of malignant transformation on plain radiographs or CT include:
Osteoid osteoma:
Osteoid osteoma key facts: Here the reactive sclerosis is the most obvious finding on the X-ray. There is reactive sclerosis with a nidus that is barely visible on the radiograph (blue arrow), but clearly visible on the CT (red arrows). CT scan is usually very helpful in detecting the nidus and differentiating osteoid osteoma from other sclerotic lesions like osteoblastoma, osteomyelitis, arthritis, stress fracture and enostosis. MRI also may detect the nidus, combined with abundant bone marrow and soft tissue edema. Osteoid osteoma (2) In most cases of osteoid osteoma the radiographic appearance is determined by the reactive sclerosis. In some cases however the osteolytic nidus can be visible on the radiograph (figure).
Osteoma:
key facts Osteoma consists of densely compact bone. It is most commonly located in the outer table of the neurocranium or in a paranasal sinus.
Osteomyelitis:
Osteomyelitis is a mimicker of various benign and malignant bone tumors and reactive processes that may be accompanied by reactive sclerosis. Acute osteomyelitis is characterised by osteolysis. Sclerosis is usually the most prominent finding in subacute and chronic osteomyelitis. A periosteal reaction with or without layering may be present. Sometimes a more solid periosteal reaction is present combined with cortical thickening and broadening of the bone. Here an image of a patient with chronic osteomyelitis. Centrally there is an ill-defined osteolytic area. The major part of the lesion consists of reactive sclerosis.
Osteosarcoma:
Key facts Osteosarcoma (2) Here images of an osteosarcoma in the right femur. It is barely visible within the bone, but an agressive periostitis is seen (arrow). Continue with the MR-images. The sagittal T1WI and Gd-enhanced T1W-image with fatsat show a large tumor mass infiltrating a large portion of the distal femur and extending through the cortex into the soft tissues.
Parosteal osteosarcoma:
Parosteal osteosarcoma is a sarcoma that has it's origin on the surface of the bone. It grows primarily into the surrounding soft tissues, but may also infiltrate into the bone marrow. It is nost commonly located on the posterior side of the distal meta-diaphysis of the femur. Ossification in parosteal osteosaroma is usually more mature in the center than at the periphery. This is opposed to myositis ossificans which may present very close to the cortical bone, but maturation develops from the center to the periphery.
Paget's disease of bone:
Paget disease is a chronic disorder of unknown origin with increased breakdown of bone and formation of disorganized new bone. The most common appearance is the mixed lytic-sclerotic. In this case we see the pathognomonic triad of bone expansion, cortical thickening and trabecular bone thickening in the mixed lytic and sclerotic phase of Paget's disease of right hemipelvis.
Reactive processes:

Myositis ossificans:
Here a patient with a mineralized mass in the soft tissues. Notice that the mineralization is predominantly in the periphery of the mass and that there is a lucent zone between the mass and the cortical bone. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement of the mass with extensive surrounding edema. This is consistent with the diagnosis of a reactive process like myositis ossificans.
Stress fractures:
Stress fractures occur in normal (fatigue fractures) or metabolically weakened (insufficiency fractures) bones. Usually stress fractures are easy to recognize. Uncommonly it can be difficult to differentiate a stress fracture from a pathologic fracture, that occurs at the site of a bone tumor. Uncommonly it can be difficult to differentiate a stress fracture from a bone tumor like an osteoid osteoma or from a pathologic fracture, that occurs at the site of a bone tumor. Here an example of a patient with a stress fracture of the distal fibula. Coronal MR image demonstrates subtle low intensity line representing the fracture. Differential diagnosis based on the periosteal reaction and the extensive edema:
Posttraumatic calcifications:
Here a patient with a juxtacortical sclerotic mass of the proximal humerus (left). This proved to be a reactive calcification secondary to trauma. Notice the resemblance to a juxtacortical mass in another patient (right), which was a biopsy proven parosteal osteosarcoma. This shows that differentiating a tumor from a reactive proces scan be quite difficult in some cases. When a reactive process is more likely based on history and imaging features, follow-up is sometimes still needed.
Subungual exostoses:
Subungual exostoses are bony projections which arise from the dorsal surface of the distal phalanx, most commonly of the hallux. These lesions are not osteochondromas, but consist of reactive cartilage metaplasia. The radiographic appearance and location are typical.
Nora's lesion:
Here two patients with a bizar parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (BPOP), also called Nora's lesion. This benign reactive process is most commonly found adjacent to the cortex of phalanges of hands or feet (75%). The cortical bone and bone marrow compartment are not involved. Rapid growth of the mineralized mass is not uncommon.

Non-traumatic changes:
Mini Pathria and Jennifer Bradshaw
Department of Radiology of the University of California School of Medicine, San Diego, USA and the Medical Centre Alkmaar, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2010-01-01 This article is based on a presentation given by Mini Pathria and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Jennifer Bradshaw. In part I we discussed the MR features of various muscle injuries. In part II we will discuss non-traumatic muscle changes.
Introduction:
When assessing muscle pathology try to decide which one of the four basic patterns of abnormality is present: Some of these conditions, such as polymyositis, require biopsy for appropriate therapy to be initiated. In other conditions, such as myositis ossificans, biopsy should be avoided because it may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of a neoplasm and thus to inappropriate therapy. Clues to the correct diagnosis and whether biopsy is necessary are often present on the MR images, especially when they are correlated with clinical features and the findings from other imaging modalities (1). The patient on the left had slipped on the ice in the hospital parking lot and torn the hamstrings. The hamstring tear was associated with sciatic neuritis, when the sciatic nerve became irritated by the hematoma.
Muscle Edema:
Muscle edema is the most common MR-pattern. It is hard to make a specific diagnosis based on the MR-findings alone. Be sure to get the right history because it usually provides the clue. The most common cause of muscle edema is trauma, which was discussed in Muscle MR imaging - Part I. Muscle MR imaging - Part I: traumatic muscle changes
Inflammatory myopathy:
Inflammatory myopathy is a term that defines a group of muscle diseases involving inflammation of skeletal muscle and often the adjacent fascia, with elevated CPK. They are thought to be autoimmune disorders. When using the term inflammatory myopathy, one is actually considering three separate disease entities, namely dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). On the left an example of inflammatory myopathy. Note increased signal of all the muscles, in all the compartments. This is edema. There is also some edema of the subcutaneous tissues. It is very unusual for a trauma, for example, to present with edema in all compartments. There are no fluid collections within the muscles, but notice the perifascial fluid collections. On the left a patient with myositis. Again we see that multiple compartments are affected, there is a vast amount of edema, skin involvement and perifascial fluid. It is non-specific but myositis could be suggested. Inflammatory myositis is generally bilaterally symmetrical. MR features of myositis include normal architecture on T1-weighted images, feathery edema with enhancement, skin reticulation and abnormalities NOT limited to specific compartmental or neural anatomy.
Polymyositis:
On the left a patient with polymyositis (PM), one of the inflammatory myopathies. The large proximal muscles are involved, generally in a symmetric pattern. Generally speaking, not all muscles are involved, so MR can help locate the best area for biopsy. Sometimes whole body MR is used for diagnosis and follow-up of polymyositis after steroid therapy has been initiated.
Inclusion body myositis:
Induction body myositis, one of the inflammatory myopathies, is a more recently recognized form of myositis of unknown cause. It is the most common acquired myopathy in patients > 50 years and makes up about a quarter (16-28%) of all inflammatory myopathies, although inflammation is not a prominent feature in this disease. It is an indolent disease and there are no skin changes. The muscles that tend to be involved are the deltoid, quadriceps (see next example), finger flexors and ankle dorsiflexors. Patients present with muscle weakness, the disease owes its name to the histological finding of vacuoles and filamentous inclusions. Although the findings are non-specific, it is worth considering this diagnosis in a older patient with abnormalities of the above mentioned muscles. Inclusion body myositis On the left a patient with inclusion body myositis. Notice the symmetrical involvement of the quadriceps and the lack of edema in the surrounding tissues.
Myositis in collagen vascular disease:
Patients with underlying collagen vascular diseases can develop myositis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease and Sjogren syndrome. For example, as in this patient with SLE, it can be very focal (coronal image, right leg, adductor loge) or nodular. A type of nodular myositis is focal proliferative myositis, it is the least common form. This can be seen in association not only with collagen vascular diseases but also lymphoma. The lesion caused by myositis is sometimes indistinguishable from lymphoma itself, and biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis. On the left another patient with focal nodular myositis which looks like any other mass on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post contrast. With a history of lymphoma you could suggest focal nodular myositis, but there is nothing definitive about the images. The relationship of myositis to underlying malignancy remains controversial, and the frequency of this association is not well established. 2 types of cancer show a relationship with myositis: ovarian cancer and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(shown on the left a patient with, strangely enough, metastatic thyroid cancer). Myositis can precede malignancy (as in a paraneoplastic syndrome), which is not to say that routine screening for malignancy
is called for in patients presenting with myositis.
Radiation myositis:
Myositis due to radiation can be seen many years after the therapy. It seems to be a vascular problem which doesn't disappear after cessation of the therapy. The history is usually the clue, but also you may see a band like appearance where the radiation changes in the muscles stop, corresponding with the radiation field. Graves disease
Graves disease:
On the left a well-known example of inflammatory myopathy which has an endocrine etiology: Graves disease, otherwise known as thyroid eye disease. The inflammation of the eye muscles and orbital fat with subsequent volume increase leads to proptosis. Graves disease Same patient, coronal T2-weighted image. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) myositis
Drug induced myositis:
Several drugs can induce myositis and in the author's practice the most frequent culprit seems to be a lipid-lowering statin. In a significant number of patients statins induce muscle pain and myositis, the dosage then needs to be decreased or the drug needs to be discontinued. On the left an example, note the inflammatory changes in the large muscles around the buttocks. After discontinuation of the drug, the muscle pain will disappear in about 2 weeks, the MRI however will still show abnormalities until roughly a month later. The best time to do a follow-up MR is about 6 weeks after stopping the drug. Lipitor myositis Coronal T1-weighted and T2-weighted with fatsat This was an older patient with elevated cholesterol who was put on Lipitor. The patient developed muscle aches and pains, CPK was mildly elevated. The changes are rather subtle, we see perifascial fluid collections, around the edges of the muscle (the epimysium). Also there are minimal skin changes. HIV myositis
HIV myositis:
Antiretroviral drugs (used in HIV positive patients) can also cause myositis because they interfere with the mitochondrial repair mechanism. The abnormalities are very similar to those in myositis induced by lipid-lowering statins. Again, the patients present with weakness and pain, the changes are centrally located in the larger muscles. The differential in HIV positive patients is relatively long (autoimmune, HIV wasting syndrome with type II muscle fiber atrophy,
denervation and infection). It is obviously important to be able to rule out infection in these patients. One way to differentiate between the two is to look for symmetry. Zidovudine (AZT) myopathy, or HIV myositis, is symmetrical.
Infection is usually unilateral or at least asymmetrical. T1-weighted image with fatsat post contrast Fluid collections within the enhancing muscle in a patient with pyomyositis
Myositis due to infection:
Muscle infection or myositis without abscess or necrosis may produce edema as the sole abnormality on MR images. The MR images and clinical history may suggest the presence of such an infection. Bacterial myositis frequently progresses to abscess formation and thus often has a masslike appearance on MR images. Viral infection does not progress to abscess formation. Muscle infection can be due to: Important groups at risk for muscle infection are diabetics, immuno-compromised patients, patients with a penetrating wound (including ulcers that cause infection to spread deep or skin infections). The hallmark of muscle infection is fluid collections present inside the muscle (figure). Pyomyositis
Pyomyositis:
On the left T2-weighted, T2FS, and post contrast sagittal images of the knee. On the T2-weighted image we see a posterior mass with inflammatory changes in the surrounding muscles. The T2-weighted image with fatsat shows an ill-defined fluid collection and the inflammatory changes in the muscle are clearer. So far this is a non-specific finding. It could be a tumor but tumors tend not to have so much inflammatory change around them. Lack of central enhancement combined with surrounding inflammatory changes and a suggestive history will help to make the diagnosis of pyomyositis. Pyomyositis Same patient, T1-weighted image post Gadolineum with fatsat. Pyomyositis (2) On the left another example of pyomyositis, much more extensive, in a patient with AIDS who had a loculated abscess. Note the thick enhancing walls. On the left another case of pyomyositis. Note the asymmetry with enlargement of the left extremity. There is subcutaneous, fascial, and muscular inflammation. Generally speaking muscle infection is a clinical diagnosis, but MR can help determine the depth and extent of the disease. MR also is helpful to locate fluid collections or abscess formation, which can then be aspirated for culture. Pyomyositis (3) On the left bilateral psoas abscesses as a complication of osteomyelitis of the spine in a patient with TB. Necrotizing fasciitis
Necrotizing fasciitis:
Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection of the deeper layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues, easily spreading across the fascial plane within the subcutaneous tissue. Group A streptococcus is the most frequent pathogen found in necrotizing fasciitis. These bacteria are sometimes called 'flesh-eating bacteria', which is a misnomer as the bacteria do not actually eat the tissue. They cause the destruction of skin and muscle by releasing toxins, which include streptococcal pyogenic exotoxins. Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis:
On the left an example of another inflammatory disease: Sarcoidosis. Sarcoid is confusing on MR, because you will see changes in the skin and a peculiar nodular enhancement pattern in the muscle. 1-2% of patients with active sarcoid will have muscle involvement and there are always skin changes on the overlying skin. The enhancement pattern is also referred to as the 'Stars and Stripes' pattern, mostly because of the stripes on the long axis of the muscle. Enable Scroll

Muscle Atrophy:
Gymnast and a couch potato The fat present in a muscle will be either intramuscular or intermuscular. There obviously is a wide range of amount of fat present. Far left an example of an olympic gymnast with 6% body fat.
Next to it an example of most of us mortals, the so called couch potato, with much more intra- and inter-muscular fat.
Atrophy patterns:
The image on the far left demonstrates fatty infiltration of muscle in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy or peroneal muscular atrophy. It affects both motor and sensory peripheral nerves. The image next to it demonstrates atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle. The supraspinatus muscle is small and there is peritendinous atrophy. This is the pattern that you will see when the tendon is torn and there is disuse.
Denervation and Peripheral nerve entrapment:
In the acute phase of denervation, the MR is normal. In the early subacute phase after one week, there will be uniform muscle edema and paradoxical hypertrophy (the muscle looks swollen). In the late subacute phase after 3 weeks, there will be mixed edema and atrophy. The chronic phase is characterized by only atrophy. Denervation due to cervical root avulsion On the left a patient with cervical root avulsion. The para-spinal musculature shows a mixture of edema and atrophy, 3 weeks post-trauma. On the left a patient with peroneal nerve entrapment by a ganglion, leading to atrophy of the peroneus longus, peroneus brevis and the anterior compartment. Note the increased signal intensity of the anterior muscles, due to edema, meaning early atrophy. On the left an example of atrophy in a patient with a resection arthroplasty of the right hip (Girdlestone procedure). There is atrophy of the thigh musculature and gluteal muscles due to disuse. There is a decrease in size of the muscles and there is fatty replacement in a peritendinous pattern. On the left a patient with a ganglion (blue arrow) in the shoulder. Stop and think for a moment about what causes ganglions in the shoulder. There is a subtle increase in signal in the infraspinatus muscle (yellow arrow), due to edema. Remember that the early subacute stage of denervation presents with edema. The nerve is being impinged by the ganglion. This patient had a labral tear (not pictured), which can lead to ganglion formation. It is important to make this diagnosis while the muscle is not yet atrophic. If the ganglion is aspirated or removed on time, the nerve function will be restored before the muscle becomes atrophic. On the left a different patient with a paralabral ganglion (not pictured). There is atrophy of both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle. There is volume loss and edema, without any focal fluid colllections. Obturator nerve clipped at surgery On the left a case in which the obturator nerve was clipped at surgery. This is the chronic phase where there is volume loss and fatty replacement of the muscle. On the left another patient with a tear of the posterior labrum and a paralabral cyst. Study the images and try to determine if there is any atrophy. Then continue with the T1-weighted image. This case illustrates how important it is to include a T1-weighted image to your exam! If you were to have only the T2-weighted image with fat sat, you would miss the atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle, which has been entirely replaced by fat. The chronic phase of denervation is characterized by only atrophy. On the left images of a patient with an Erb's palsy. On the left images of a patient with chronic denervation due to polio. On the left a patient with edema of both the deltoid muscle and the supraspinatus. This is an important observation since these muscles are innervated by different nerves. The deltoid muscle is innervated by the axillary nerve and supraspinatus muscle by the suprascapular nerve. This means that the lesion is more proximal. This patient had Parsonage-Turner Syndrome, also known as brachial neuritis. This is an inflammatory disorder characterized by severe pain, followed by weakness due to denervation. Note also edema of the infraspinatus muscle.
Muscular dystrophy:
Muscular dystrophy is a less common cause of atrophy. It is diagnosed clinically usually in children, with patients experiencing symmetrical muscle weakness, pseudohypertrophy of the calves and difficulty in standing up. The muscle initially is edematous and then rapidly becomes atrophic. There are many types of muscular dystrophy. The most common type is Duchenne. On the left an example of adult onset muscular dystrophy. There is subtle high signal intensity of the quadriceps muscle bilaterally due to edema, with a feathery appearance. Most of the adductor muscle is normal. Note the lack of skin edema. This is an important finding to be able to differentiate from inflammatory myositis, in which the skin is also edematous. The imaging findings correspond to the acute stage of muscular dystrophy. In a chronic setting, the muscle will be atrophied with fatty replacement. On the left T1- and T2-weighted images of the thigh muscles. Notice that there is an obvious difference between the signal intensities of the quadriceps muscle and the posterior muscles. On the T1-weighted image only the posterior muscles contain normal fat. On the T2-weighted image there is edema of the quadriceps, which is a sign of early muscular dystrophy. Although the exact diagnosis cannot be made by MR, it can be helpful in suggesting a location for biopsy to determine the type of muscle degenerative disease. On the left an example of chronic muscular dystrophy. The muscle has been entirely replaced by fat. When the muscle loses its nerve supply it becomes atrophic. Dysfunction at any level of the motor unit can lead to denervation with muscle atrophy as a result.
Accessory muscles:
Accessory soleus muscle Accessory muscles may present as an asymptomatic painless mass or with symptoms of nerve entrapment or vascular entrapment. On the left an example of an accessory soleus, on the medial side of the ankle, which caused compression of the tibial nerve (i.e. tarsal tunnel syndrome). In order to diagnose this entity, you must be really familiar with the anatomy of the area being studied. Patients with accessory muscles will usually present with a painless mass, which will be marked by the lab technician. Initially, the MR appears normal. However, be aware that there are 3 questions that you must consider in these cases: Accessory peroneocalcaneus internus muscle On the left a wrist examination showing an accessory forearm flexor muscle. Accessory extensor digitorum manus brevis On the left an example of an accessory muscle at the dorsum of the wrist (T1- and T2-weighted). Under the marker is a well-defined mass, iso-intense to normal muscle. It is a muscle at mid-carpal level, with normal signal. Normally, at this level, there is no muscle on the extensor side of the wrist, just tendon. This is an accessory extensor digitorum manus brevis. A recent article in Radiographics lists the accessory muscles in the human body
(Sookur PA et al. Accessory Muscles: Anatomy, Symptoms, and Radiologic Evaluation. Radiographics 2008;28:481-499). Accessory soleus muscle On the left an example of a common accessory muscle: the accessory soleus. Normally the soleus muscle inserts almost entirely onto the achilles tendon with a very small soleal tendon passing anteriorly to the achilles tendon. In about 1-2% of the population however, the soleus comes down and inserts directly onto the calcaneus. This will present as a palpable mass and is usually, but not always, bilateral. Accessory soleus muscle On the left a low lying soleus muscle, but it did not have a separate tendinous insertion on the calcaneus. Accessory muscle posterior to the neurovascular bundle On the left another example of an accessory muscle which lies medial to the flexor hallucis longus (middle) and peroneus brevis (lateral). This is a common area for accessory muscles, and there are a lot of different muscles that can be found here (to differentiate you need to determine where the tendon inserts). The reason that this is presented for imaging is because it compresses the adjacent neurovascular bundle leading to atrophy of the muscles of the foot or tarsal tunnel syndrome with tingling of the sole of their foot or weakness. Accessory anconeus epitrochlearis muscle (red arrow)Ulnar nerve with high signal indicating ulnar neuritis (blue arrow) On the left an elbow, the medial side is on the left. Note that there is a muscle directly behind the ulnar nerve, which in a normal situation whould not be present. This is an accessory anconeus epitrochlearis, found in 10% of the population. It is a common cause of ulnar neuritis, due to compression, with pain and tingling of the ulnar side of the hand, and sometimes atrophy of the hypothenar and thenar musculature. Always look carefully at the nerve when you have encountered this muscle. David A. May et al October 2000 RadioGraphics, 20, S295-S315.

Arthritis:
Laurens van Baardewijk, Frank Looijmans, Frank Smithuis and Matthieu Rutten
Máxima MC, Cooperative Lumirad U.A., Amsterdam University Medical Center, Jeroen Bosch Hospital and Radboud University Medical Center in The Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2023-01-15 In this article we provide an overview of the different imaging findings of common joint diseases as a useful tool in daily musculoskeletal radiology. Arthritis is a challenging topic. A long list of diagnoses has to be considered when looking at X rays of the hand and feet, each with its own extensive set of findings. 
Sometimes the abnormalities are pathognomonic for a specific disease, but more often the findings are non-specific because there is a lot of overlap between different joint diseases. When you start looking at arthritis cases, remember the following: You can click on all images for an enlarged view.
Systematic Approach:
Modified from Jacobson, et al. Radiology 2008 (2) This flow chart shows the approach to the radiographic evaluation of arthritis. In the presence of joint space narrowing, it is important to differentiate degenerative from inflammatory conditions. Degenerative joint diseaseThis is characterized by osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis with an asymmetric distribution both when you compare left and right as well as within the joint itself. Usually it is typical osteoarthritis. 
When findings are atypical (unusual combination of age, affected joint and severity) think of posttraumatic, CPPD, neuropathic or rare diseases like hemophilic arthritis. Inflammatory joint diseaseThis is characterized by bone erosions, osteopenia, soft-tissue swelling and uniform, symmetric joint space loss.
Inflammation of a single joint should raise concern for infection.
Multiple symmetric joint inflammation in a proximal distribution in the hands or feet without bone proliferation suggests rheumatoid arthritis.
When the inflammation is more in a distal distribution in the hands or feet with bone proliferation it suggests a seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SpA).
SpA is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases associated with HLA-B27 (2).
Axial SpA - most commonly ankylosing spondylitis -  is located more in the axial skeleton.
Peripheral SpA - like psoriatic, reactive and IBD-associated arthritis -  is located more in the peripheral skeleton.
ABCDE-S:
Joint diseases have variable manifestations with an overlap of radiological features. 
The ABCDE-S mnemonic is a helpful tool for a systematic and complete radiological interpretation and reporting. 
We use the ABCDE-S, which stands for Articular, Bone, Cartilage, Distribution,Extra's and Soft tissue.
There are variants of this mnemonic. Some use ABCDE  for Alignment,  Bone, Cartilage, Distribution and Effusion.
Articular - erosions:
Marginal erosions 
They occur at the bare area of the joint, where the bone is not covered by articular cartilage. They are typically seen in rheumatoid arthritis (MCP-joints) and psoriatic arthritis (DIP). Subchondral erosions 
They occur at the subchondral bone plate of the articular surfaces. They are a typical feature of erosive osteoarthritis. Gullwing deformityIn erosive osteoarthritis the combination of central erosions and osteophytes results in a gullwing deformity. Pencil-in-cup deformity
In psoriatic arthritis the combination of marginal erosions and bone proliferation can result in a pencil-in-cup deformity. Peri- or juxtaarticular erosions. 
Gout erosions are a bit more eccentric juxta-articular located, where the joint capsule attaches to the bone. They are most often seen in the MTP1-joint. Typical examples of specific erosion patterns Alignment Some use the A of ABCDE-S for Alignment.
The problem however is that misalignment or malalignment can be seen in all end-stage joint diseases, whether it is degenerative or inflammatory.
Bone - formation:
Bone formation or proliferation is seen in many joint diseases and especially in osteoarthritis, DISH and spondyloarthritis like ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. 
It is NOT present in the active phase of rheumatoid arthritis. Images Two examples of periarticular osteopenia in rheumatoid arthritis. Click on image to enlarge.
Bone - density:
Bone density changes either present as osteopenia or as osteosclerosis.
Periarticular osteopenia (figure)is typically seen in rheumatoid arthritis and not in osteoarthritis. Peri-articular demineralization develops as a result of the hyperemia of the inflamed synovium and soft tissues.
Subchondral sclerosis is typically seen in osteoarthritis. Also in patients with neuropathic arthritis. Images
Here two examples of periarticular osteopenia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
The osteopenia can be very subtle.
It may help to play with the window width settings (detail views in the center) or to look through your eyelashes to see the osteopenia.
Cartilage:
Degenerative diseases affect the cartilage non-uniformly or asymmetrically, since this is the result of mechanical load, which is not evenly distributed throughout the joint. Inflammatory diseases affect the cartilage uniformly, since the synovitis is present in the entire joint. Click on image to enlarge.
Distribution:
Understanding distribution patterns is a very powerful tool, since most common diseases (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis) have distinctive patterns. 
In the following chapters on the various joint diseases, we will start each chapter with an illustration of the distribution. Distribution in the hands
Extra findings:
Serological tests can help when rheumatic diseases are suspected. A positive rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody test can support the diagnosis when rheumatoid arthritis is suspected.
A positive HLA-B27 test can aid establishing a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
Nonspecific inflammatory markers, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the C-reactive protein (CRP), are often elevated in any inflammatory disease. However, immunologic tests are not always helpful, since they have limited specificity.
Soft tissue:
Soft tissue swelling and calcifications are frequently seen in arthritis and can help to narrow the differential diagnosis.
Osteoarthritis:
Key findingsNon-uniform joint space narrowing with osteophytes, most often in weight-bearing joints. No erosions. Clinical Radiological findings Teaching point:Many arthropathies show secondary osteoarthritis in a later stage. In the knee, osteoarthritis is classified by the Kellgren and Lawrence classification. 
This classification can be used when grading degeneration in other joints, but it is primarily designed for the knee. A
Joint space narrowing of the 4th DIP joint  (arrow) with osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis. B
Asymmetric joint space narrowing of the 2-5th DIP joint with osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis and slight ulnar deviation of the 3th DIP joint (arrow).
The PIP joints are also affected, but less severe. C
Slight narrowing of the cranial joint space of the hip joint at the right side with osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis (Kellgren-Lawrence classification grade 3). D
Severe narrowing of the glenohumeral joint space with osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis (Kellgren-Lawrence classification grade 4). E
Hip osteoarthritis
Severe non-uniform narrowing of the hip joint with osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis and large cyst formation.
In these later stages, joint deformity with broadening and deformation of the femoral head can occur. F
Knee osteoarthritis
Moderate to severe asymmetric narrowing of the medial compartment of the femorotibial joint space with osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis (Kellgren-Lawrence classification grade 3-4). G
CMC1 osteoarthritis
Non uniform joint space narrowing of the CMC 1 joint with osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis. 
There is a large subchonderal cyst in the base of the first metacarpal (white arrow). HSTT osteoarthritisNon uniform joint space narrowing of the scaphotrapeziotrapezoid (STT) joint with osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis. This is a difficult case. Dominant finding is non-uniform joint space narrowing in CMC and DIP joints. So this patient has osteoarthritis. The severity of findings may suggest erosive osteoarthritis. However, there is also joint space narrowing of the MCP joints and a possible erosion in the lunate bone. Without abnormalities in the PIP joints it is very unlikely that these abnormalities are all due to osteoarthritis. Most likely this patient has both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
Rheumatoid Arthritis:
Key findingsSymmetrical uniform cartilage damage with marginal erosions predominantly in MCP-joints and the carpus, not in DIP-joints. No bone proliferation. Clinical Radiological findings Typical marginal erosions and joint space narrowing of MCP 3-5. 
Also note the uniform joint space narrowing of the MCP joints.
The PIP-joints only show minimal joint space narrowing. End stage Rheumatoid arthritis. This is a case with end stage rheumatoid arthritis with severe erosive changes and ligamentous ruptures causing dislocation of the MCP joints. Scapholunate dissociation (white arrow) is a common finding due to diffuse carpal inflammation. Both the dissociation and inflammation can cause joint space narrowing in the radiocarpal joint. Notice also the erosion in the distal ulna with surrounding soft tissue swelling (blue arrow). Rheumatoid arthritis in the feet In this case of rheumatoid arthritis there are marginal erosions adjacent to almost all MTP joints (arrowheads).
The 5th MTP joint is most frequently involved in  rheumatoid arthritis.
When erosions are as severe as in this case, it can look like pencil-in-cup deformity (white arrow) as is frequently seen in psoriatic arthritis. 
However, the primarily affected MTP joints distribution and less affected interphalangeal joints is the clue that this is a case of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatic nodule at the elbow Rheumatoid nodules Rheumatoid nodules are firm lumps that appear subcutaneously in up to 20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
These nodules usually occur adjacent to overexposed joints that are subject to trauma or pressure, such as the fingers joints and elbows. In this variant of rheumatoid arthritis, there are often no joint abnormalities. Images
Soft tissue mass (i.e., rheumatoid nodules) in the subcutis at the dorsolateral side of the olecranon. Atlanto-axial subluxation due to rheumatoid arthritis of the cervical spine
Atlanto-axial subluxation:
The cervical spine is often affected in rheumatoid arthritis and can present as atlantoaxial instability, subaxial subluxation or basilar invagination with cranial settling.
Cranial settling occurs when the dens extends into the foramen magnum. Atlanto-axial subluxation is an important and potentially life threatening complication of rheumatoid arthritis. It is defined when the space between the dens of C2 and the arch of the atlas exceeds more than 3 mm. It is caused by inflammatory ligamentous laxity. Instability in this joint may result in numerous neurological symptoms due to compression of the spinal cord. Images In flexion of the cervical spine there is widening of the distance (14 mm) between the dens and the posterior surface of the anterior atlas ring (normal ≤3 mm). Enable Scroll

Basilar invagination:
Basilar invagination also called cranial settling or basilar impression occurs in 5-10% of patients with cervical rheumatoid arthritis. In basilar invagination the odontoid is prolapsing into the foramen magnum limiting the space for the spinal cord. Clinical presentations range from chronic headaches, limited neck motion to acute neurologic deterioration (spinal cord and brain stem compression, which can lead to paralysis or even death if the neck is moved in certain positions). Images Scroll through the CT-images. There is upward migration of the odontoid process into the occipital foramen.
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis:
Key findingsPolyarthritis in the pediatric population with variable manifestations and radiographic findings. ClinicalIt starts before the age of 16 years. Usually located in the larger joints. Joint changes are distinct from adult RA, however the distribution can be similar. 
Radiological findings Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a diagnosis of exclusion, when inflammatory changes do not match other inflammatory diseases. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is also called juvenile idiopathic arthritis. ImageTypical ankylosis of the carpal bones. Periarticular osteopenia In this patient with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis there are multiple erosions in the carpus and in the base of the metacarpal bones.

Multiple erosions affecting the carpal bones and MCP joints. Collapse of the scaphoid and lunate bone. B. Adult with a history of juvenile arthritis. Abnormal bone length due to premature growth plate closure and epiphyseal overgrowth. Severe joint malalignment. Both cases show periarticular osteopenia. Large erosions of the humerus, glenoid and acromion in a patient with juvenile idiopatic arthritis. Erosions and joint space narrowing of the right hip joint in a patient with juvenile idiopatic arthritis.
Erosive osteoarthritis:
Key findingsArthropathy with the age of onset and distribution of osteoarthritis, with an inflammatory and erosive component. Clinical Radiological findings Erosive osteoarthritis in two patients A
Erosive changes of PIP 2-5 and DIP 3-5.
Typical gullwing deformity in DIP 3 (white arrow). 
Ankylosing of PIP 4 (yellow arrow), which occurs in a late phase of the disease. B
Joint space narrowing with central erosions. Gullwing deformity of PIP 2-4, DIP 2 and CMC-1 joint. 
Ankylosing of DIP 3. Medial deviation of PIP 2. Ball catcher view of the hands in a patient with erosive osteoarthritis. There is bilateral extensive damage to the IP joints.
Note the symmetrical distribution and sparing of the MCP joints. Typical gull-wing appearance of the DIP-joints, also known as seagull erosions or sawtooth appearance.
This is classically seen in erosive osteoarthritis, but has also been reported in psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis.
Septic arthritis:
Septic arthritis Key findingsRapid destruction of one joint with extensive erosions and effusion. ClinicalSeptic arthritis, also called infectious arthritis, is usually an acute mono-arthritis.  
It is secondary to bacteremia, local spread of infection or a complication of surgery or injection. 
Septic arthritis leads to rapid joint destruction and  requires prompt aspiration or drainage. Radiological findings Images
A. Soft tissue calcifications in the rotator cuff. Patient got a subacromial injection for relief of symptoms. B. After corticosteroid injection severe cartilage loss in the glenohumeral joint and bone destruction of the humeral head occured. This was the result of a septic arthritis, which is a rare complication of injection. Septic arthritis of the PIP 3-joint.
There is enormous soft tissue swelling of the 3rd finger. 
There are extensive erosions of the joint with some small bone fragments. Infectious arthritis as a compllication of a fingertip abscess. The findings are: This radiograph of the pelvis is of a patient with tuberculous arthritis of the left hip joint.

Disable Scroll Much to everyone's surprise there were multiple abscesses.
When abscess formation is this extensive and the clinical findings are minimal, always think of tuberculous arthritis. The diagnosis of tuberculous arthritis was made by joint aspiration.
Spondyloarthritis - SpA:
Spondyloarthritis (SpA) comprises a group of inflammatory diseases of the joints and spine, with various clinical manifestations. There have some key features in common, including: Spondyloarthritis can further be divided into an axial and a peripheral type.
Ankylosing spondylitis is the most common axial type and the prototypical type of spondyloarthritis. 
The most common peripheral types are psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis and enteropathic arthritis (associated with inflammatory bowel diseases). Classification criteria for SpA from the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) are: The clinical features of spondyloarthritis are listed in the table.
Ankylosing Spondylitis:
Key findings
Axial arthropathy, with enthesitis (edema, shiny corners), syndesmophytes and sacro-iliitis. ClinicalSignificant back pain, morning stiffness and disability. 
The onset is in the 3rd and 4th decade and the prevalence is about 1%.
Ankylosing Spondylitis is the prototypical type of seronegative, axial SpA and primarily affects the spine and SI-joints although other joints like shoulders, hips, ribs, heels and small joints of the hands and feet can become involved. Radiological Early stage ankylosing spondylitis Enthesitis
Inflammation of the enthesis is one of the hallmarks of SpA. 
The earliest sign of ankylosing spondylitis is edema at the enthesis, which is only visible on MRI (white arrow). 
In a later stage sclerosis will present as shiny corners on X-rays or CT.
Finally syndesmophytes are formed along these enthesis (see next images). Images 
Three different patients with typical features of early stage ankylosing spondylitis: Ankylosing spondylitis Syndesmophytes
These images show syndesmophytes in the lumbar spine and ossification of the paraspinal ligaments.
When these syndesmophytes fuse, this produces the typical “bamboo spine” appearance. Also note the ossification of the intervertebral disc and ankylosis of the facet joints. Syndesmophytes have a typically vertical orientation.
Bridging and fusing is quite common.
As a result the spine looses its flexibility and can easily fracture even after a minor trauma. Bamboo spine
Bamboo spine in ankylosing spondylitis. Fusion of the lumbar spine by syndesmophytes and ossification of the paraspinal ligaments. 
Notice the ligamentous calcification (arrow). A rigid bamboo spine is prone to hyperextension fractures, even after mild trauma. 
Always have a high suspicion of these fractures in a rigid spine! Ankylosing spondylitis of the cervical spine A bamboo spine often begins at the lumbar level and can ascend up to the cervical spine.
Notice the squaring of the vertebral bodies (arrow). Dagger sign The radiopaque central line on frontal radiographs of the spine due to ossification of the interspinous ligaments, known as the “dagger sign”, is a radiographic feature of ankylosing spondylitis. 
Also note the complete fusion of the SI-joints. Sacroiliitis in ankylosing spondylitis
Sacro-iliitis:
An important hallmark of SpA is sacro-iliitis.  
It starts with inflammation, which is visible on MRI as edema, with or without erosions (visible on MRI and conventional imaging). 
Later on you will see fatty metaplasia on MRI or sclerosis  alongside the SI-joints on radiographs. 
In the end stage there is ankylosis of the SI-joints. X-ray Bilateral subchondral sclerosis and erosions of the sacroiliac (SI) joints caused by sacro-iliitis. MRI T1W post contrast MR of the same patient shows an irregular contour of the SI-joints caused by erosions. There is enhancement in the subchondral bone and bone marrow edema. There is no joint effusion. I.V. contrast does not necessarily have to be used for the diagnosis of sacro-iliitis. Enable Scroll

Differential Diagnosis of sacro-iliitis: The diagnosis of sacro-iliitis can be challenging based on these X rays alone. It can be helpful to include an X-LWK or other investigation to become more certain. Late stage sacro-iliitis with ankylosis of the SI-joints. Hatchet lesion. Ankylosing spondylitis of the humeral head The Hatchet sign is a circumscribed erosion of the lateral-dorsal aspect of the humeral head leading to a hatchet-shaped deformity.
A hatchet is a small axe. This deformity is typical for ankylosing spondylarthritis. Avascular necrosis of the humeral head Hatchet sign versus avascular necrosis The hatchet sign differs from the deformity seen in avascular necrosis, where there is progressive collapse of the articular surface of the humeral head. Milwaukee shoulder syndrome Milwaukee shoulderA rare shoulder arthropathy that can simulate the hatchet shoulder is the Milwaukee shoulder syndrome.
It is characterized by rupture of the rotator cuff and large joint and bursal effusions with deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals leading to rapid destruction of the glenohumeral joint. Image
Severe destruction of the humeral head with cephalic migration and erosions of the acromion indicating total cuff rupture. 
In the Milwaukee shoulder syndrome, symptoms are often much milder than imaging suggests. 
In this case, there was no attempt to diagnose calcium hydroxyapatite crystals in the synovium. 
Based on clinical and radiographic findings, Milwaukee shoulder syndrome was diagnosed. Ankylosis of the hip joints Ankylosis of the hip joints with joint space narrowing in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis. 
There is also ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints.
Psoriatic arthritis:
Key findings
Erosions and bone proliferation predominantly in a distal distribution, presenting most often as a typical pathognomonical pattern, but sometimes as a confusing subtype (see differential diagnosis). ClinicalPsoriatic arthritis is a peripheral type of spondyloarthritis and presents as a peripheral arthritis with or without sacroiliitis and spondylitis.
It frequently is preceded by psoriasis of the skin, but can occur without skin disease in up to 20% of patients.
Enthesopathy is common.
The hands are most commonly involved followed by the feet. Other locations are the spine, sacroiliac joints and less frequently knee, elbow, ankle and shoulder. Radiological findings Differential Diagnosis
Rheumatoid arthritis, erosive osteoarthritis, reactive arthritis There are five subtypes of psoriatic arthritis. Due to these different patterns, the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis can sometimes be challenging. Sausage digits and pencil in cup deformity in Psoriatic arthritis Sausage digits Typical appearance of dactylitis “sausage digits” with soft tissue swelling and pencil-in-cup deformity of DIP 1-2 and 5 of the left hand in a patient with psoriatc arthritis. Notice that the MCP joints are not involved (unlike in RA). Psoriatic arthritis Progressive psoriatic arthritis The distribution and the bone formation makes the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis unlikely. The marginal erosions and the absence of DIP involvement in other joints makes the diagnosis of erosive osteoarthritis unlikely, although pencil-in-cup can look like the gullwing deformity in erosive osteoarthritis. Psoriatic arthritis Pencil in cup deformity A. Pencil in cup deformity of 1st and 5th toe. 
B. Acro-osteolysis with resorption of the terminal tuft of digits 2-4 and 5. 
There are erosions in MTP 2 and 3. Psoriatic arthritis Periostitis in psoriatic arthritis This is a patient with psoriatic arthritis.
Notice the subtle periostitis of the distal phalanx of dig 1 on the right (arrowhead).
There are small erosions of the tuft of dig 2 and 3 on the left (white arrows).
Reactive arthritis:
Clinical Reactive arthritis is a sterile arthritis following soon after an infection
elsewhere in the body, usually of genitourinary or enteric origin. 
It is caused
by a cross-reaction of the antigen reaction to bacteria as well as synovial
tissue. 
Classically patients present with conjunctivitis and urethritis,
leading to the triad: can't see, can't pee and can't bend the knee. Radiological findings This patient suffered from an episode of campylobacter gastroenteritis. 
After a
few weeks clinical symptoms of arthritis emerged. ImageOn the right there are
erosions at the base of the 3rd proximal phalanx and at the head of the 5th
proximal phalanx (white arrowheads). 
On the left there is an erosion at the base of the 3rd proximal
phalanx and lytic changes of the head of the 1st proximal phalanx (yellow arrowheads). Based on the aspecific imaging findings alone, it is difficult to diagnose reactive arthritis. 
The preceding infection makes it more likely.
Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis:
Key findingsBulky spondylophytes, over more than 4 contiguous levels, located at the right side of the lower thoracic vertebrae. Clinical Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH) is also known as Forestier’s disease. Most often asymptomatic.
It is characterized by bony proliferation at tendinous and ligamentous insertion of the spine and pelvis mostly affecting elderly individuals. Radiological findings Teaching point
In daily practice, it is the classic differential diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, especially in early stages of both diseases. 
Teach yourself the differences between the two (see below). DISH DISH should not be confused with the findings of a bamboo spine, which is the hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis. Image Other causes of ligamentous ossification in the spine are severe osteoarthritis, and less likely: vitamin A toxicity and fluorosis. Image of another patient with DISH. 
There is enthesopathy of the iliac crest, ischial tuberosities and greater
trochanters. The lower part of the SI joint is normal (unlike ankylosing spondylitis). 
Ossification of the ligaments in the upper part of the SI joint is present. Image Typical ossification and calcification of the anterior and paraspinal ligament
and connective tissue over more than 4 contiguous levels. 
Large
ossifications of the anterior longitudinal ligament.
There is some non-typical
narrowing of facet joints. 
No sign of
degenerative disc disease. Ankylosis due to DISH and ankylosing spondylitis can result in a rigid spinal column. Then, the spine is prone to fracture after even mild trivial trauma. These fractures are most often hyperextension fractures. This patient had a minor trauma, which however resulted in an unstable hyperextension fracture with neurological complications. Teaching point: you should always have a high suspicion of hyperextension fractures in patients with rigid spine due to DISH and ankylosing spondylitis.
Gout:
Key findings
Tophi with juxtaarticular erosions at the capsule insertion of a joint, typically MTP1, in patients with risk factors like diabetes and kidney disease Clinical
Gout
is an inflammatory arthropathy caused by the deposition of sodium urate
crystals in joints and periarticular soft tissues and tendons. The first MTP
joint is most often affected (podagra). Classically the diagnosis is made
clinically, supported by joint aspiration. Radiological findings Late stage of Gout Characteristic radiologic changes in the
chronic stage of gout.
Typically well-defined “punched-out” eccentric erosions with sclerotic margins in a marginal and juxta-articular distribution.
These erosions have overhanging edges called rat bite erosions.
There is preservation of joint spaces. Periarticular hyperdense soft tissue swelling due to tophi as a result of crystal depositions (pathognomonic). 
These are located in the ligamentous structures around the joints. Typical involvement of the 1st MTP joint with punched-out erosion.
The soft tissue swelling represents a tophus. The dislocation is not a common finding in gout, but in this case the result of the erosions and ligamentous injury. Soft tissue density Typical dense soft tissue swelling surrounding the 1st MTP joints bilateral.
Juxta-articular erosions at the medial side of the distal MT, which have sclerotic margins.
They are most notably on the right side (arrow). Continue with the Dual Energy CT... Dual Energy CT in a patient with gout and urate crystal depositions Dual
Energy CT of the same patient with gout showing the urate crystal depositions. In
this 3D reconstruction the crystal depositions are color coded green and can be
seen surrounding the MTP joints and at the insertion of the right achilles
tendon (arrow). 
The green pixels in the nail beds of digitus 1 and 5 on the left are artifacts caused by keratin in thickened nails. Dual
Energy CT is a noninvasive method of urate crystal detection that can
make joint aspiration unnecessary.
Dual Energy CT simultaneously scans the subject at two different energy levels.
Because urate crystals show different attenuation at these energy levels, the
crystals can easily be identified with high accuracy. Another case with typical gout tophi and juxtaarticular erosions on plain films. Dual Energy CT shows gout attenuation in MTP1, MTP2 and interphalangeal joints of the 3rd digit. DECT is useful for the diagnosis when findings are not so typical. 
It is also very useful to show the extent of disease. In this case, a bone tumor was suspected.
There are definitely some findings that could support the diagnosis of an osteosarcoma of chondrosarcoma. However, this was proven to be gout. 
Continue with the DECT images... With these DECT images, nobody was in doubt anymore. Punched out erosions In this case there is a classical
punched out erosion of the MCP3 joint with an overhanging edge (arrow). The
borders of the erosions in gout can be sclerotic because of the indolence of
the process, creating a punched-out or “mouse bitten” appearance. Calcified tophi The images show extensive tophi around the knee joint in a patient with gout (arrowheads). 
In the knee, these locations (insertion popliteus tendon, insertion quadriceps tendon, insertion MCL) are very typical. 
There is mild
joint effusion.
The joint space narrowing is likely due to secondary
osteoarthritis. When in doubt, think gout This is a difficult case.
Small bilateral erosions of the PIP
joints on both sides are seen. 
The arrowheads show that the erosions are more juxtaarticular in this patient that proved to have gout. Based on the distribution, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis would have been an option. 
However then the erosions would have been more marginally located. 
Also, the MCPs are spared, making the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis less likely. Soft tissue swelling This case is also challenging. 
Multipele joint are affected, but there is no typical distribution. The only thing that these joints have in common is the surrounding hyperdense soft tissue swelling. 
This was due to gout tophi.
CPPD:
Key findingsFine chondrocalcinosis located at the TFCC or menisceal tissue in the knee. Clinical Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition (CPPD) is an inflammatory joint disease caused by deposition of calcium
pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals into the synovial fluid, synovial lining and
articular cartilage. Some terms regarding CPPD can be a bit confusing: Radiological findings Two patients with typical CPPD. A. There is cartilage loss in many joints and chondrocalcinosis in: B. This patient had an acute joint inflammation. Chondrocalcinosis in the radiocarpal joint and the TFCC (black arrows) is seen, almost pathognomonical for CPPD. There is scapholunate dissociation, which can be seen in CPPD, but also in rheumatoid arthritis or posttraumatic. This sudden attack is called pseudogout, because it can simulate the inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack. Chondrocalcinosis in CPPD There
are faint calcifications of the cartilage and meniscus both on the right side
(white arrow) as well as on the left side (black arrows). 
These can be caused
by CPPD, but may be seen in other conditions as well, such as gout or
osteoarthritis. Also note the joint space narrowing and mild osteophyte
formation. 
CPPD has many features similar to osteoarthritis. There is a well-circumscribed coarse calcification adjacent to the 4th DIP joint. This does not look like CPPD and scleroderma would have been more likely. However, aspiration revealed typical CPPD crystal depositions. As in other arthropathies, atypical presentations of CPPD are possible, but fortunately less common.
Scleroderma:
Key findingsSoft tissue calcifications and acro-osteolysis Clinical Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease and
is characterized by microvascular obliteration and sclerosis of the skin and
internal organs.
The
clinical hallmark of the disease is the appearance of taut tethering of the
skin. 
Clinically evident arthritis occurs in up to 65% of patients, and it may
be one of the earliest manifestations of scleroderma. There
is a limited and a multisystem variant. CREST syndrome is a common type of limited scleroderma (skin calcinosis,
Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly
and telangiectasia). The systemic variant can affect virtually every organ system or can be
localized. Radiological findings Soft tissue calcifications Extensive soft tissue calcifications in the distal phalanges in a patient with scleroderma.
Notice the calcifications next to the distal ulna (arrow).
There are no signs of cartilage damage. The pathophysiology of the calcium deposits is not well
understood. 
It occurs in tissues that are under chronic stress, such as local
trauma or damage associated with an underlying inflammatory process.
It is usually
more abundant in the dominant hand.
When these findings are present, the diagnosis is usually straight forward. Subtle, but coarse soft tissue calcifications at the most distal part of the finger in a patient with scleroderma. No acro-osteolysis or other signs are seen. Acro-osteolysis in Scleroderma Severe acro-osteolysis of the finger tips of dig
1-3 in a patient with scleroderma (arrows). Notice the lysis of the soft tissues distally. Acro-osteolysis is a
radiographic finding which refers to bone destruction of the distal phalanges and occurs in 6–65% of patients with scleroderma. 
Vascular alterations and
reduced capillary density impair tissue oxygenation and the resulting hypoxia
may contribute to osteoclast activation. There is a wide variety of diseases that can cause
acro-osteolysis including psoriatic arthritis, infection, raynaud disease and thermal trauma. A. Subcutaneous and periarticular calcifications in the foot of a patient with scleroderma. 
There is also a hallux valgus deformity, which is not caused by scleroderma. B. Subcutaneous calcifications near the elbow in a patient with scleroderma.
These subcutaneous calcifications often form at pressure points.
Systemic lupus erythematosus:
Key findings
Abnormal joint alignment without erosions. Avascular necrosis. Clinical SLE is a generalized autoimmune connective tissue disease. 
Essentially any
organ system can be affected with systemic (weakness, malaise, fever),
mucocutaneous (typical butterfly rash on the face), renal and neurological
symptoms. Radiological findings SLE: Z-thumbs and swan neck fingers Z-thumbs and swan neck fingers in a patient with SLE. 
The deformities are
thought to be a consequence of low-grade inflammation of the synovial membrane
and capsule resulting in ligamentous laxity and muscular contracture. Swan neck deformity Here another example with extensive alignment deformities without erosions or signs of cartilage damage in a patient with SLE. Another patient with a swan
neck deformity. 
Usually this is reversible in the early stage of the disease.
Avascular necrosis:
Avascular
necrosis is a frequent complication in SLE in up to 15% of patients. 
The femoral
head and tibial plateau are the most involved sites, but other sites may be
affected. 
SLE patients with bone pain should be suspect of having
avascular necrosis. 
Avascular necrosis in SLE can occur even in the
absence of steroid use. Images Increased density in the distal femur in a guirlande-like pattern, representing avascular necrosis in a
patient with SLE. A. Subluxation of the 1st MCP joint without erosions in a patient with SLE. This is not typical for SLE and can be seen in other forms of arthritis like for instance osteoarthritis. B. SLE of the shoulder. Collapse of the humeral head with some loose bony fragments due to avascular necrosis. Both steroid therapy and SLE are associated with an increased risk of avascular necrosis.
Sarcoid:
Key findings
Lace-like granuloma lesions in the bone ClinicalSarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology characterized by
the formation of inflammatory non-caseating granulomas.
Musculoskeletal manifestations of
sarcoidosis occur in about 20% of patients with sarcoidosis and include joint
involvement, bone lesions, and muscular disease.
Primary skeletal involvement
without other organ involvement is extremely rare. Usually arthritis is seen
early in the course of sarcoid disease, chronic sarcoid arthritis is rare.
The most frequent musculoskeletal
manifestation of sarcoidosis is an acute arthritis that occurs as part of
Löfgren’s syndrome characterized by the combination of erythema nodosum,
bilateral hilar adenopathy, polyarthritis, and constitutional symptoms. Radiological findings Lace-like granulomas Multiple bone lesions in a patient with sarcoid.
The osteolytic lesions are quite typical and described as having a lace-like or trabecular pattern.
Once you have seen this, you will recognize it in other cases. The image shows an osteolytic lesion in the distal radius (blue arrow) with trabecular and cortical
bone destruction in a patient with sarcoid. There is osseous destruction on both sides of the interphalangeal joint of the first digit with extraosseous extension
of granulomatous tissue (black arrow).
Amyloidosis:
Clinical Amyloidosis is a systemic disease in which normally soluble proteins
(amyloid) are deposited as an insoluble proteinaceous material in the
extracellular spaces.
Amyloid is often deposited into the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract and
nervous systems.
The secondary form of amyloidosis is associated with diseases such as multiple myeloma, hemodialysis, RA and chronic infection. 
Musculoskeletal manifestations are most often depositions in periarticular tendons and capsule.
Amyloid arthropathy is extremely rare and only 5-13% of patients have bone or joint involvement. Radiological findings Amyloidosis is very difficult to diagnose on conventional imaging alone, MR is more useful for the diagnosis. Enable Scroll

series of a patient with amyloid arthropathy of the shoulder joint. The
findings are: This
soft tissue swelling should not be mistaken for rice bodies as seen in rheumatoid
arthritis.
Neuropathic arthropathy:
ClinicalNeuropathic arthropathyalso known as Charcot arthropathy is a progressive destructive joint disorder in patients with peripheral neuropathy with
loss of pain sensation and proprioception in the foot, ankle or hands.
Patients may experience fractures and dislocations of bones and joints with
minimal or no known trauma.
The most common cause is diabetes mellitus, which typically affects the tarsal
and tarso-metatarsal joints. Arterial wall calcification is commonly seen in
these patients. Other causes are tabes dorsalis
(tertiary syphilis), syringomyelia, leprosy and CPPD. Radiological findings These radiographs are of two different patients with diabetes and neuropathic arthropathy. A. Destruction of the tarsometatarsal joints with periarticular lucencies. B. Typical
radiological changes in the foot of a diabetic patient. There is lateral
subluxation of the TMT joints (Lisfranc dislocation). The changes in bone and joints itself may mimic severe osteoarthritis, severe inflammation or septic arthritis.
The key in this case is the clinical history with the presence of diabetic neuropathy. Rocker bottom deformity
On this weight-bearing lateral view the dislocation in the TMT joints is even better visible. For a more detailed explanation of diabetes-related foot problems go to MRI examination of the diabetic foot. Diabetic Hand Syndrome
The diabetic hand syndrome is the inability to use the hand due to contractures and stiffness. 
It can affect the
proximal and distal IP and MCP-joints and
is often painless. 
Prolonged hyperglycemia is thought to result in the accumulation of advanced
glycation end products (AGEs).
These AGEs can break down collagen and
deposit abnormal amounts of collagen in connective tissue around the joints,
resulting in stiffening and hardening of the joints and the skin. ImagesDestruction of the CMC-1 and all DIP-joints.
Erosions and bone destruction adjacent to the IP1, DIP 2-5 and PIP 4-5. 
There is subluxation of PIP 4-5 and DIP 2-5. 
Notice the extensive vascular calcifications in a patient with
Diabetes Mellitus type 2. The hand of this patient with neuropathy shows a status after removal of the trapezium (arrow). 
There is destruction of all DIP joints and erosions adjacent to the PIP and MCP joints.
There are erosions and bone destruction adjacent to the IP1, the DIP and PIP and MCP joints.
There is subluxation and dislocation of DIP 2, 4 and 5 and PIP 2-4.
Hemophilic arthropathy:
Key findings
Extensive findings that look like osteoarthritis, but in an unusual distribution or pattern. Clinical Hemophilia is an inherited coagulation bleeding disorder which is mainly
X-linked recessive and therefore occurs almost exclusively in males.
About 50% of the hemophilia patients develop haemophilic arthropathy.
This results from recurrent hemarthrosis, which leads to synovial hyperplasia, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and
hemosiderosis. 
It is frequently mono- or oligoarticular.
Early prophylaxis with coagulation factors considerably reduces the musculoskeletal complications. Radiological findings Teaching point: when findings look like osteoarthritis, but in an odd presentation or distribution, think hemophilic arthropathy. Hemophilic arthropathy of the right knee (Arnold-Hilgartner classification: Stage III) This patient has a history of hemophilia and repetitive hemarthros. Images
Distention
of the suprapatellar recess of the right knee due to hemarthrosis (black arrow).
There is narrowing of the medial joint space

radiography). Images
The image of the right knee shows joint space narrowing, subchondral cysts formation and
erosions of the medial and lateral tibial plateau.
Normal left knee joint for comparison. This patient has a long term history of repetitive hemarthrosis as a result of hemophilia. Images
A slightly widened intercondylar notch on the left hand side, which can also be
found in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculous arthropathy. 
Bulbous
femoral condyles with flattened condylar surfaces. 
The congruent bony
deformation on the left hand side can also be seen in tuberculous arthropathy. This is stage V Arnold-Hilgartner classification hemophilic arthropathy. with severe joint space narrowing, subchondral cyst formation and erosive destruction. Hemophilic arthropathy of the shoulder This image is of a patient with hemophilia and recurrent hemarthrosis of the shoulder joint. There are features of secondary osteoarthritis with subchondral sclerosis and
osteophyte formation at both sides of the glenohumeral joint. 
In general
hemophilic arthropathy has similarities with osteoarthritis. 
However, the
presence of erosions, extensive subchondral bone cyst formation and the history of recurrent hemarthrosis are distinguishing features in favor of hemophilic arthropathy. Hemophilic arthropathy of the ankle Image of the ankle of a patient with hemophilia. The findings are: Hemophilic arthropathy End

CRMO - chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis:
Key findings
Multifocal areas of sterile bone inflammation ClinicalChronic Recurrent Multifocal
Osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an uncommon autoinflammatory disorder of the bone of children
and young adults that is characterized by nonbacterial osteomyelitis.
Patients present with
episodic multifocal bone pain secondary to sterile osseous inflammation. The disease has a relapsing and remitting course. The cause of CRMO is
unclear. The diagnosis is made by exclusion, and the main causes to be excluded
are neoplasms and infections.
It is sometimes diagnosed along with inflammatory
bowel disease or psoriasis and there seems to be a genetic component.
CRMO is
comparable to SAPHO in adults. Radiological findings Cortical thickening, sclerosis and bone enlargement
of the diaphysis and metaphysis of the right clavicle and the metaphysis of the left
clavicle. SPECT-CT and Bone scintigraphy of the
same patient. Abnormal tracer uptake in corresponding areas, reflecting
increased bone turnover. X-ray of a patient
with CRMO with pain on the left side. There is subcortical osteolysis lateral in the proximal femur (arrow) The MRI (axial and coronal T1 TSE FS with contrast) shows a region of bone and soft tissue enhancement. 
This was due to non-infectious
osteomyelitis with extra
osseous extension. There is also a small CRMO location visible in the dorsal
aspect of the trochanter major on the right. Multiple CRMO locations This patient has locations in the humeral head and
proximal diaphysis and in the coracoid on the right and the distal tibia on both sides.
SAPHO syndrome:
ClinicalSAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis)
is an uncommon inflammatory disorder of bone, joints and skin.
The pathogenesis of SAPHO syndrome is not
well understood.
It is sometimes described as an autoinflammatory disorder. 
The
pediatric counterpart of the disease is known as CRMO. Radiological findings Teaching point: the degree of inflammation determines the type of bone abnormalities. Osteolysis will occur when there is extensive inflammation. Increase of bone activity and sclerosis will occur when there is less inflammation. Patient with SAPHO syndrome

of the clavicles on both sides. CT of the same patient. 
There is
extensive hyperostosis of the medial side of the clavicles and sternum.

Gallbladder wall thickening:
Adriaan van Breda Vriesman, Robin Smithuis, Dries van Engelen and Julien Puylaert
Radiology Department of the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp; the Groene Hart Hospital, Gouda and the Medical Centre Haaglanden, the Hague, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2006-02-01 Thickening of the gallbladder wall is a relatively frequent finding at diagnostic imaging studies. Historically, a thick-walled gallbladder has been regarded as proof of primary gallbladder disease, and it is a well-known hallmark feature of acute cholecystitis. The finding itself, however, is non-specific and can be found in a wide range of gallbladder diseases and extracholecystic pathological conditions. In this review we discuss and illustrate the various causes of a generalized thickened gallbladder wall. If you encounter printing problems with the margins of the document, try to adjust the margins or the scale of the document in the print settings.
Introduction:
Distended hydropic and hyperemic gallbladder in acute cholecystitis due to stone obstruction in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct. Sonography, CT and MRI all allow direct visualization of the normal and thickened gallbladder wall. Traditionally, sonography is used as the initial imaging technique for evaluating patients with suspected gallbladder disease, because of its high sensitivity in the detection of gallbladder stones, its real-time character, speed and portability [1]. However, CT has become popular for evaluating the acute abdomen and often is the first modality to detect gallbladder wall thickening [2], or it may be used as an adjunct to an inconclusive sonography or for staging of disease. The potential value of MRI in the evaluation of gallbladder pathology has been shown [3], but it still plays little role. LEFT: US of a normal gallbladder after an overnight fast shows the wall as a pencil-thin echogenic line (arrow).RIGHT: US in the postprandial state shows pseudothickening of the gallbladder
Normal gallbladder:
The normal gallbladder wall appears as a pencil-thin echogenic line at sonography. The thickness of the gallbladder wall depends on the degree of gallbladder distention and pseudothickening can occur in the postprandial state. Contrast-enhanced CT shows the normal gallbladder wall as a thin rim of enhancing soft-tissue The normal gallbladder wall is usually perceptible at CT as a thin rim of soft-tissue density that enhances after contrast injection. LEFT: US in a 59-year-old woman with acute cholecystitis shows the layered appearance of a thickened gallbladder wall, with a hypoechoic region between echogenic linesRIGHT: At contrast-enhanced CT the thick-walled gallbladder contains a hypodense outer layer (arrow) due to subserosal oedema
Thickened gallbladder wall:
Thickening of the gallbladder wall is a relatively frequent finding at diagnostic imaging studies. A thickened gallbladder wall measures more than 3 mm, typically has a layered appearance at sonography [1], and at CT frequently contains a hypodense layer of subserosal oedema that mimics pericholecystic fluid [2]
Differential diagnosis of gallbladder wall thickening:
The differential diagnosis of gallbladder wall thickening is listed on the left. Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening may produce a diagnostic problem, as it occurs in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and in patients with and without an indication for a cholecystectomy. Diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall may occur in patients who do not have a primary gallbladder disease, but in whom the gallbladder is secondarily involved in an extrinsic pathological condition. In these patients a cholecystectomy is unwarranted, and gallbladder abnormalities will usually return to normal after correction of its extrinsic cause.
Primary gallbladder disease:
43-year-old woman with acute calculous cholecystitis. Contrast-enhanced CT shows a distended gallbladder (arrowheads) with a slightly thickened wall and subtle regional fat-stranding (asterisk). There is an impacted obstructing stone in the neck of the gallbladder (arrow).
Acute cholecystitis:
Acute cholecystitis is the fourth most common cause of hospital admissions for patients presenting with an acute abdomen [4], and it is the prime diagnostic concern when a thick-walled gallbladder is found at imaging. 
This feature, however, is not pathognomonic for acute cholecystitis. Additional imaging signs that support the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis are: Acute calculous cholecystitis On the left images of a 62-year-old man with acute calculous cholecystitis. Transverse sonogram at the spot of maximum tenderness shows a non-compressible hydropically distended thick-walled gallbladder (arrowheads), with an intraluminal stone and sludge or debris. Contrast-enhanced CT depicts extensive fat inflammation (arrowheads) surrounding the
gallbladder (arrow). 74-year-old man with acute acalculous cholecystitis. LEFT: US at the spot of maximum tenderness shows mural thickening of the gallbladder (arrow) that is completely filled with sludge (asterisk) without any stones. RIGHT: Power-Doppler sonography shows hypervascularity of the gallbladder wall (arrowhead), as a supporting sign of inflammation.
Acalculous cholecystitis:
Acute acalculous cholecystitis mainly occurs in critically ill patients, presumably due to increased bile viscosity from fasting and medication that causes cholestasis. The imaging features are those of acute cholecystitis, except for the absence of stones whereas gallbladder sludge is usually present (Fig). Because in critically ill patients gallbladder abnormalities are frequently found secondary to systemic disease (see below), acalculous cholecystitis can be difficult to diagnose [5]. In these patients a percutaneous cholecystostomy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Chronic cholecystitis. Longitudinal sonogram of the gallbladder shows slight wall thickening (arrow) and an intraluminal non-obstructing stone
Chronic cholecystitis:
Chronic cholecystitis is a term used clinically to refer to symptomatic gallbladder stones that cause transient obstruction, leading to a low-grade inflammation with fibrosis [1]. Correlation of the imaging finding of a stone-containing slightly thick-walled gallbladder with the clinical history is critical. On the left images of a 49-year-old woman with chronic cholecystitis. This patient had fasted overnight, so the wall-thickening does not represent physiologic contraction. Correlation of these findings with her clinical history of recurrent colic-like right upper quadrant pain, due to transient gallbladder obstruction, is essential for the diagnosis. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. LEFT: US shows marked wall thickening with intramural hypoechoic nodules (arrowheads), and an intraluminal stone (arrow).RIGHT: Contrast-enhanced CT shows a deformed and thickened gallbladder wall containing hypoattenuating nodules
Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis:
Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is an unusual variant of chronic cholecystitis, characterized by a lipid-laden inflammatory process comparable to xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. Imaging studies show marked gallbladder wall thickening, often containing intramural nodules that are hypoechoic at sonography and hypoattenuating at CT, representing abscesses or foci of xanthogranulomatous inflammation. These features overlap with those of gallbladder carcinoma, making preoperative distinction between these entities often impossible [6]. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Hypoattenuating nodules ( arrowheads) represent abscesses. The lumen contains several stones (arrow). On the left a 71-year-old man with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Contrast-enhanced CT shows a deformed and thickened gallbladder wall containing hypoattenuating nodules . These represent abscesses or foci of inflammation. Porcelain gallbladder.
Porcelain gallbladder:
A porcelain gallbladder is a rare disorder in which chronic cholecystitis produces mural calcification. In these patients a prophylactic cholecystectomy has been advocated because of its association with gallbladder carcinoma [4]. However, this association appears to be weak. LEFT: Gallbladder carcinoma. US shows marked generalized wall thickening (arrowheads), replacing the gallbladder lumen. Multiple gallbladder stones (arrow) indicate the probable location of the filled lumen.RIGHT: Contrast-enhanced CT depicts a thick-walled gallbladder (arrowhead), with local infiltration of the mass in the adjacent liver (arrow).
Gallbladder carcinoma:
Gallbladder carcinoma is the fifth most common malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract, and is found incidentally in 1% to 3% of cholecystectomy specimens [4]. It is often detected at a late stage of the disease, due to lack of early or specific symptoms. Gallbladder carcinoma has various imaging appearances, ranging from a polypoid intra-luminal lesion to an infiltrating mass replacing the gallbladder, and it may also present as diffuse mural thickening. Associated findings such as invasion of adjacent structures, secondary bile duct dilatation, and liver or nodal metastases may help in differentiating a carcinoma from acute or xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis [2, 4]. In absence of these associated findings, it may not be possible to differentiate a carcinoma from xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Adenomyomatosis in a 39-year-old woman. US shows mural thickening with calcifications with the characteristic 'comet-tail' reverberation artifact (arrow) due to small cholesterol crystals within Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses.
Adenomyomatosis:
Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder is characterized by epithelial proliferation, muscular hypertrophia and intramural diverticula (Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses), which may segmentally or diffusely involve of the gallbladder. It is a benign condition that requires no specific treatment, occurring as an incidental finding in up to 9% of cholecystectomy specimens [6]. The sonographic finding of cholesterol crystals, shown as 'comet-tail'
reverberation artifacts (Fig), within a thickened wall of the gallbladder strongly suggests this diagnosis. Air may produce a similar artifact, however, patients with emphysematous cholecystitis are usually ill in contrast to those with adenomyomatosis. MR imaging may be able to differentiate adenomyomatosis from gallbladder carcinoma by depicting Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses [7].
Secondary gallbladder involvement:
56-year-old man with liver cirrhosisLEFT: US depicts wall thickening (arrow), surrounded by ascites. Note the irregular cirrhotic liver parenchyma. RIGHT: At contrast-enhanced CT the wall of the gallbladder (arrow) appears nearly normal, because subserosal oedema can not be well differentiated from surrounding ascites at CT.
Liver cirrhosis:
Systemic diseases such as hepatic dysfunction, heart failure, or renal failure may lead to diffuse gallbladder thickening [1, 2]. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism leading to oedema of the gallbladder wall in these diverse conditions is uncertain, but it is likely due to elevated portal venous pressure, elevated systemic venous pressure, decreased intravascular osmotic pressure, or a combination of these factors. Hypoproteinemia has also been reported as a cause of extrinsic gallbladder disease, but this has been disputed [8]. Liver cirrhosis, hepatitis and congestive right heart failure are relatively frequent causes.
The case on the left is a patient with liver cirrhosis. The secondary gallbladder wall thickening is presumably due to elevated portal venous pressure and decreased intravascular osmotic pressure. Drug-induced hepatitis with diffuse gallbladder wall thickening
Hepatitis:
On the left a 75-year-old man with drug-induced hepatitis. Longitudinal sonogram of a non-distended gallbladder shows diffuse wall thickening (arrow), and incidental cholelithiasis which may be confusing. Drug-induced hepatitis. In the same patient with the drug-induced hepatitis MR images were obtained to evaluate the bile ducts because of abnormal liver function tests. On the far left Axial SPIR T2-weighted image (A) shows a small amount of ascites (arrowhead) which indicates that the thickened gallbladder wall (arrow) probably has an extrinsic systemic cause. Next to it an oblique HASTE image for MR cholangiography that excludes choledocholithiasis. Mural thickening of the gallbladder (arrowhead) is also shown. Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening in congestive right heart failure
Congestive right heart failure:
On the left a 74-year-old man with congestive right heart failure. Ultrasound depicts diffuse wall thickening of a stone-free painless gallbladder and large-caliber hepatic veins (arrowheads) and inferior vena cava, as supporting evidence of right heart failure. Pancreatitis in a 56-year-old man Contrast-enhanced CT shows peripancreatic inflammatory changes (arrowheads), and thickening of the wall of the gallbladder (arrow) which is secondarily involved in the pancreatic inflammation.
Pancreatitis:
Extracholecystic inflammation may secondarily involve the gallbladder causing wall thickening, due to direct spread of the primary inflammation, or less frequently due to an immunologic reaction [8]. Theoretically, it may be caused by any inflammation that extends to the region of the gallbladder, but only few are regularly encountered including hepatitis, pancreatitis (Figure), and pyelonephritis. Gallbladder wall thickening has also been reported in patients with infectious mononucleosis [9], and in patients with AIDS due to opportunistic infections or secondary neoplastic infiltration [2].

Craniosynostosis:
Joosje Bomer-Skogstad, Marjolein Dremmen, Irene Mathijssen and Robin Smithuis
Department of Radiology of Akershus University Hospital in Lørenskog, Norway, Departments of Radiology and Plastic Surgery of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and Department of Radiology of Alrijne Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
In this review we will discuss imaging in craniosynostosis. 
Craniosynostosis refers to the premature closure of sutures of the skull and results in an abnormal head shape. 
It is a rare disorder with a prevalence of around 1 in 1500. 
Most cases occur already prenatally and will be diagnosed in the first few months of life.
It may also be diagnosed intrauterine, but antenatal imaging is beyond the scope of this article.
Introduction:

Normal skull:
In the first few years of life the brain grows fast and the skull grows along with it.
This requires open sutures for enchondral growth.
At 1 year of age around 65% of skull growth is accomplished, with the growth rate thereafter slowing down, and reaching around 90% at 5 years of age. Most craniosynostoses are the result of an intrinsic defect in the suture.
Craniosynostosis may be part of a syndrome and in those cases the craniosynostosis is often multi-sutural and there may be other anomalies (cardiac, kidney and skeletal).
Clinical evaluation:
In the past decades there has been an increase in the number of children seeking medical attention because of an abnormal head shape, which is now reported as high as 1 in 5. Most cases are a positional plagiocephaly rather than a real craniosynostosis. This is often related to the advice of sleeping on the back to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. A well-trained clinician will often be able to recognize the typical presentation of a positional plagiocephaly and distinguish from its main differential diagnosis of a unilateral lambdoid stenosis (see below). 
The parents may then be reassured because the condition is self-limiting and with adequate advice usually reversible. In case of a clinical high suspicion of a craniosynostosis timely reference to a specialized center may be advisable before diagnostic imaging is started (figure).
Overview craniosynostoses:

Unisutural and Bicoronal:
In craniosynostosis the skull deformity is present from birth and will be progressive.
Timely diagnosis is important, as earlier treatment leads to a better outcome. In unisutural and bicoronal craniosynostosis a specific head shape may be expected, depending on the involved suture.
This is depicted in the illustration. In multisutural involvement the changes are more complex and cannot easily be predicted.
Plagiocephaly:
In plagiocephaly, also known as flat head syndrome, there is an asymmetrical flattening of one side of the skull.
A mild and widespread form of plagiocephaly is caused by remaining in a supine position for prolonged periods, as discussed above.
This is called deformational plagiocephaly. There is no synostosis and all the sutures are open. The synostotic form of plagiocephaly can be on the anterior side due to unicoronal closure or on the posterior side due to closure of a lambdoid suture on one side.
Imaging:
When a craniosynostosis is suspected, the first line imaging will be ultrasound or x-rays, depending on local expertise and preferences. Because of lack of radiation, ultrasound is  the preferred method. 
In case of high clinical suspicion low dose 3D CT is preferred. The figure shows the US of a normal suture, an unilateral coronal stenosis and a
sagittal stenosis with ridge. Skull radiographs
demonstrating open sutures. Be
aware that radiographs have a limited value for assessment of the sagittal
suture and a partial closure of the sagittal suture may be overlooked.
3D CT:
The images show open
sutures in a child with a physiologically closed metopic suture (arrow). Images courtesy of Dr K.A. Eley and Dr C. Delso
MRI:
It is also possible to evaluate the sutures with
black bone MRI, but as MRI often requires anaesthesia this will mainly be done in
conjunction with an indication for evaluation of intracranial abnormalities and
complications. Images

closed sagittal suture (top) and closed metopic suture (down) in two different
patients.
Positional plagiocephaly:
Positional or deformational plagiocephaly refers to the flattening of the head due to the baby’s preferred position.
It is not a synostosis, but the most common form of temporary skull deformity. Typically, the entire side is pushed forward, hence the ear will be seen more anterior than on the contralateral side (arrow). This is in contradiction to a posterior plagiocephaly resulting from a unilateral lambdoid suture stenosis, where
the mastoid and the ear are pulled down and drawn back. The drawing illustrates the differences. In positional
plagiocephaly the form of the head resembles a parallelogram. In unilateral
lambdoid stenosis the form of the head resembles a trapezium, because one side of the head is restricted in its growth. Here the same illustration with now all the differences between deformational and lambdoid plagiocephaly. NOTE: unilateral coronal stenosis will also result in
the ear being positioned more forward  – however, flattening will be
seen frontal (anterior plagiocephaly) instead of occipital and typically the
eye is drawn up on the affected side. Images Positional
plagiocephaly. The left ear is pushed forward. 
Note: Adequate clinical
evaluation and/or ultrasound should have obviated the need for CT.
Monosutural craniosynostosis:

Scaphocephaly:
Scaphocephaly means ‘boat shaped’ skull and results
from a premature closure of the sagittal suture (arrow). 
The skull is narrow and long. It is the most common monosutural craniosynostosis. 
Sometimes it is called
dolichocephaly, as ‘dolicho’ means long. Images
Scaphocephaly: The head has a short laterolateral and a long anteroposterior diameter.
Trigonocephaly:
Trigonocephaly refers to the triangular head form resulting from premature
closure of the metopic suture (arrows). Physiological closure can already start as early
as three months of age, so premature closure typically presents early. 
The
frontal head volume is small with a pointy forehead and hypotelorism. Only
pronounced cases require surgery and if there is clinically no indication for surgery, a CT is not needed. Images
Trigonocephaly: Pointy forehead and
hypotelorism. Seen from above the lateral orbital rim will be
visible.
Brachycephaly:
Brachycephaly results from the premature closure
of both coronal sutures. 
The frontal skull base is small with
shallow eye sockets with the supraorbital rim drawn back and the head is shortened (‘brachy’) in the anteroposterior direction. Images
Bilateral coronal synostosis with brachycephaly.
Synostotic Anterior plagiocephaly:
One of the coronal sutures has closed prematurely. 
The
forehead is flattened on the affected side with the eye socket drawn up, also
called a harlequin’s eye, and the nose may be deviated. Images
Left sided coronal synostosis. The left forehead is
drawn back with the eye socket lifted up.
Synostotic posterior plagiocephaly:
In this case the lambdoid suture has closed
prematurely. 
It is the main differential diagnosis for positional plagiocephaly
(see above). There is a risk for Chiari 1 malformation and MRI of the brain and craniocervical junction
is advised. Images
Right sided lambdoid synostose.
Contralateral occipitoparietal bossing is evident.
Multisutural craniosynostosis:
Multisutural craniosynostosis are complex
deformations. 
They are usually linked to syndromes and there are several
genetic defects identified. The best known
craniosynostoses syndromes are Pfeiffer/Crouzon, Apert, Saethre-Chotzen and
Muenke. 
In the most severe cases all sutures will eventually close. 
Such a
‘pansynostosis’ is a severe condition. Images
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. At two months of age there is a bilateral coronal
synostosis with a severely deformed head shape. The fontanel is grossly
enlarged. Same patient as above. At three years
old there is microcephaly from a near pan-synostosis. 
Note enlarged bilateral
parietal foramina. Three-month-old with Pfeiffer
syndrome. There is a bicoronal synostosis with enlarged anterior and mastoid
fontanels. 
Temporal bulging give rise to a trilobate appearance, also called
‘clover leaf deformity’. Note the ventriculomegaly with periventricular edema.
Intracranial complications:
Raised intracranial pressure MRI has a main role in detecting associated intracranial
malformations and complications from multisutural craniosynostosis. Images
Raised intracranial
pressure. 
LEFT: Impressions on a skull radiograph have a low sensitivity,
especially in young children, but when seen, are highly suspicious for raised
intracranial pressure. 
RIGHT: Hydrocephalus
with inverted diastolic flow indicating high intracranial pressure. Signs that may indicate raised intracranial
pressure are listed in the table on the left. One of these findings is non-specific,
but a combination of findings should raise suspicion. 
Increased intracranial
pressure may result in venous collaterals which may be important in
preoperative planning. 
Chiari malformation may result in spinal syrinx. The images are of a patient with increased intracranial pressure. There is tonsillar herniation with severe
crowding at the craniocervical junction.
This has resulted in a syrinx over the
entire length of the spinal cord.
Postoperative complications:
Surgery should be conducted timely in order to
reach an optimal outcome. Timing is dependent on the deformity, but usually
preferably under the age of 6 months. Post-operative complications include
blood loss, infection, brain swelling and CSF leak. Images
Direct complications: 
LEFT Large effusion/hematoma
from migrating spring. 
RIGHT
subgaleal hematoma with severe blood loss. Image

herniation in the upper nasal passage after midface surgery in a patient with Apert syndrome.
Pitfalls:
Metopic ridge
Metopic ridge:
A metopic ridge alone is not equivalent to
trigonocephaly. 
Children present at a later age, the frontal skull has a normal
volume and there is no hypotelorism. It is a common deformity that can be
clinically diagnosed and does not need imaging. 
As
with mild trigonocephaly, there is no need for surgery. Images
Slight metopic ridge in a nine-month-old (arrow). Note that
the scan was taken for a different purpose. 
Metopic ridge can be clinically
diagnosed and should not be imaged.
The anterior fontanelle has already closed
but apart from the metopic suture, the other sutures are still open.
Absent anterior fontanelle:
An absent anterior fontanelle does not have to
be a reason for concern. 
As long as the skull has a normal shape and
circumference, and the sutures are patent – it does not have any clinical
implications. Image

fontanelle (bregmatic bone) in a six-month-old.

Chest X-Ray - Basic Interpretation:
Robin Smithuis and Otto van Delden
Radiology Department of the Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp and the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2013-02-18 [update 2022-04-04] The chest x-ray is the most frequently requested radiologic examination. In fact every radiologst should be an expert in chest film reading. The interpretation of a chest film requires the understanding of basic principles. In this article we will focus on: Pathology of the heart, mediastinum, lungs and pleura, chest wall and abdomen. Normal and Variants
Normal and Variants:

PA view:
On the PA chest-film it is important to examine all the areas where the lung borders the diaphragm, the heart and other mediastinal structures. At these borders lung-soft tissue interfaces are seen resulting in a: These lines and silhouettes are useful localizers of disease, because they can be displaced or obscured with loss of the normal silhouette. This is called the silhouette sign, which we will discuss later. The paraspinal line may be displaced by a paravertebral abscess, hemorrhage due to a fracture or extravertebral extension of a neoplasm. Widening of the paratracheal line (> 2-3mm) may be due to lymphadenopathy, pleural thickening, hemorrhage or fluid overload and heart failure. Displacement of the para-aortic line can be due to elongation of the aorta, aneurysm, dissection and rupture. The anterior and posterior junction lines are formed where the upper lobes join anteriorly and posteriorly. These are usely not well seen and we will not discuss them. An important mediastinal-lung interface to look for is the azygoesophageal line or recess (arrow).
Azygo-esophageal recess:
The azygo-esophageal recess is the region inferior to the level of the azygos vein arch in which the right lung forms an interface with the mediastinum between the heart anteriorly and vertebral column posteriorly. It is bordered on the left side by the esophagus. Deviation of the azygoesophageal line is caused by: Notice the deviation of the azygoesophageal line on the PA-film. It is caused by a hiatal hernia.
The arrow point to the barium contrast within the hiatal hernia.
Vena azygos lobe:
A common normal variant is the azygos lobe. The azygos lobe is created when a laterally displaced azygos vein makes a deep fissure in the upper part of the lung. On a chest film it is seen as a fine line that crosses the apex of the right lung. Here another patient with an azygos lobe. The azygos vein is seen as a thick structure within the azygos fissure. In some patients an extra joint is seen in the anterior part of the first rib at the point where the bone meets the calcified cartilageneous part (arrow). This may simulate a lung mass.
Pectus excavatum:
In patients with a pectus excavatum the right heart border can be ill-defined, but this is normal. It produces a silhouette sign and thus simulating a consolidation or atelectasis of the right middle lobe. The lateral view is helpful in such cases. Pectus excavatum is a congenital deformity of the ribs and the sternum producing a concave appearance of the anterior chest wall.
Lateral view:
On a normal lateral view the contours of the heart are visible and the IVC is seen entering the right atrium. The retrosternal space contains air and should be radiolucent down to the level where the right ventricle borders the sternum (small black arrow). 
Any radiopacity in this upper retrosternal area is suspective of a process in the anterior mediastinum or upper lobes of the lungs. As you go from superior to inferior over the vertebral bodies they should get darker, because usually there will be less soft tissue and more radiolucent lung tissue (white arrow). If this area becomes more dense, look carefully for pathology in the lower lobes. Diaphragm The contours of the left and right diaphragm should be visible. The right diaphragm should be visible all the way to the anterior chest wall (red arrow). Actually we see the interface between the air in the lungs and the soft tissue structures in the abdomen. The left diaphragm can only be seen to a point where it borders the heart (blue arrow). At that point the interface is lost, since the heart has the same density as the structures below the diaphragm. Pulmonary vessels The left main pulmonary artery (in purple) passes over the left main bronchus and is higher than the right pulmonary artery (in blue) which passes in front of the right main bronchus. Once you know how the normal hilar structures look like on a lateral view, it is easier to detect abnormalities. In this case on the PA-view there is hilar enlargement. On the PA-view it is not clear whether this is due to dilated vessels or enlarged lymph nodes. On the lateral view there are round structures in areas where you don't expect any vessels. So we can conclude that we are dealing with enlarged lymph nodes. This patient has sarcoidosis. Notice also the widening of the paratracheal line (or stripe) as a result of enlarged lymph nodes. On the lateral view spondylosis may mimick a lung mass. Any density in the area of the vertebral bodies should lead you to the PA-film to look for spondylosis, which is usually located on the right side (arrows). On the left side the formation of osteophytes is hampered by the pulsations of the aorta. On the PA-view the superior mediastinum is widened. The lateral view is helpful in this case because it demonstrates a density in the upper retrosternal space. Now the differential diagnosis is limited to a mass in the anterior mediastinum (4 T's). This was a Hodgkins lymphoma. A common incidental finding in adults is a Bochdalek hernia, which is due to a congenital defect in the posterior diaphragm (arrows). In most cases it only contains retroperitoneal fat and is asymptomatic, but occasionally it may contain abdominal organs. Large hernias are sometimes seen in neonates and can be complicated by pulmonary hypoplasia. A hernia of Morgagni is also a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but is less common. It is located anteriorly.
Systematic Approach:
Whenever you review a chest x-ray, always use a systematic approach. We use an inside-out approach from central to peripheral. First the heart figure is evaluated, followed by mediastinum and hili. Subsequently the lungs, lungborders and finally the chest wall and abdomen are examined. You have to know the normal anatomy and variants. Find subtle abnormalities by using the sihouette sign and mediastinal lines. Once you see an abnormality use a pattern approach to come up with the most likely diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
Old films:
It is extremely important to always compare with old films, as we will demonstrate in this case. Actually someone said that the most important radiograph is the old film, since it gives you so much information. For instance a lung mass, which hasn't changed in many years is not a lung cancer. First study the chest films.
Based on these films, you could make the diagnosis of congestive heart failure, but the findings are subtle. Continue with the old film... Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll back and forth to the old film.
Once you compare the chest film to the old one, things become more obvious and you will be much more confident in your diagnosis of congestive heart failure: 1. No silhouette sign in a consolidation located in the left lower lobe (blue arrow). 2. Silhouette sign in a consolidation in the lingula lobe (yellow arrow).
Silhouette sign:
The loss of the normal silhouette of a structure is called the silhouette sign.This is an important sign, because it enables us to find subtle pathology and to locate it within the chest. Here an illustration to explain the silhouette sign: Silhouette sign (2) The PA-film shows a silhouette sign of the left heart border. Even without looking at the lateral film, we know, that the pathology must be located anteriorly in the left lung. This was a consolidation due to a pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Silhouette sign (3) Here a consolidation which is located in the left lower lobe (yellow arrow).
Notice that there is a normal silhouette of the left heart border (blue arrow). The absence of a silhouette sign tells us that the pathology is located in the left lower lobe and not in the lingula. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Silhouette sign (4) On this lateral film there is too much density over the lower part of the spine.
First study the lateral film and decide on which side the pathology is located. Then click on the image to enlarge and scroll through the images. By only looking at the interfaces of the left and right diaphragm on the lateral film, it is possible to tell on which side the pathology is located. In this case we cannot follow the contour of the right diaphragm all the way to posterior, which indicates that there is something of water-density in the right lower lobe. Continue with the PA-film of the same patient... On the PA-film there is a normal silhouette of the right heart border, so the pathology is not in the anterior part of the chest, which we already had decided by studying the lateral view. Question:
Why do we still see the silhouette of the right diaphragm on the PA-film? Answer:
What we see is actually the highest point of the right diaphragm, which is anterior to the pneumonia in the right lower lobe. The pneumonia does not border the highest point of the right diaphragm and there will be no silhouette sign.
Hidden areas:
There are some areas that need special attention, because pathology in these areas can easily be overlooked. These areas are also known as the hidden areas: Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Notice that there is quite some lung volume below the dome of the diaphragm, which will need your attention (blue area). Hidden areas (2) Here an example of a large lesion in the right lower lobe, which is difficult to detect on the PA-film, unless when you give special attention to the hidden areas. Click on the image for an enlarged view. Hidden areas (3) Here a pneumonia which was hidden in the right lower lobe mainly below the level of the dome of the diaphragm (yellow arrow). Notice the increase in density on the lateral film in the lower vertebral region. You may have to enlarge the image to get a better view. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Hidden areas (4) First study the CXR.
Then scroll through the images. Notice the subtle increased density in the area behind the heart that needs special attention (blue area). This was a left lower lobe pneumonia. First study the CXR. We know that in some cases there is an extra joint in the anterior part of the first rib which may simulate a mass. However this is also a hidden area where it can be difficult to detect a mass. In this case a small lung cancer is seen behind the left first rib. Notice that is is also seen on the lateral view in the retrosternal area. Continue with the PET-CT. The PET-CT demonstrates the tumor (arrow) which has already spread to the bone and liver. The diagnosis was made by a biopsy of an osteeolytic metastasis in the iliac bone. First study the CXRs. There is a subtle consolidation in the left lower lobe in the hidden area behind the heart. Again there is increased density over the lower vertrebral region.
Heart and Pericardium:
On a chest film only the outer contours of the heart are seen. In many cases we can only tell whether the heart figure is normal or enlarged and it will be difficult to say anything about the different heart compartments. However it can be helpful to know where the different compartments are situated. Left Atrium Right Atrium Left Ventricle Right Ventricle Left Atrium Left Ventricle Right Ventricle Left Atrium enlargementThis is a patient with longstanding mitral valve disease and mitral valve replacement. Extreme dilatation of the left atrium has resulted in bulging of the contours (blue and black arrows). Right ventricle enlargementFirst study the PA and lateral chest film and then continue reading. On these chest films the heart is extremely dilated. Notice that it is especially the right ventricle that is dilated. This is well seen on the lateral film (yellow arrow). There is a small aortic knob (blue arrow), while the pulmonary trunk and the right lower pulmonary artery are dilated. All these findings are probably the result of a left-to-right shunt with subsequent development of pulmonary hypertension. The location of the cardiac valves is best determined on the lateral radiograph. A line is drawn on the lateral radiograph from the carina to the cardiac apex. The pulmonic and aortic valves generally sit above this line and the tricuspid and mitral valves sit below this line (4). On this lateral view you can get a good impression of the enlargement of the left atrium.
Cardiac incisura:
Click image to enlarge. On the right side of the chest the lung will lie against the anterior chest wall. On the left however the inferior part of the lung may not reach the anterior chest wall, since the heart or pericardial fat or effusion is situated there. This causes a density on the anteroinferior side on the lateral view which can have many forms. It is a normal finding, which can be seen on many chest x-rays and should not be mistaken for pathology in the lingula or middle lobe. The explanation for the cardiac incisura is seen on this CT-image. At the level of the inferior part of the heart we can appreciate that the lower lobe of the right lung is seen more anteriorly compared to the left lower lobe. Pacemaker There are different types of cardiac pacemakers. Here we see a pacemaker with one lead in the right atrium and another in the right ventricle. A third lead is seen, which is guided through the coronary sinus towards the left ventricle. This is done in patients with asynchrone ventricular contractions. Pacing both ventricles at the same time will lead to synchrone contractions and a better cardiac output. More on cardiac pacemakers...
Pericardial effusion:
Whenever we encounter a large heart figure, we should always be aware of the possibility of pericardial effusion simulating a large heart. On the chest x-ray it looks as if this patient has a dilated heart while on the CT it is clear, that it is the pericardial effusion that is responsible for the enlarged heart figure. Especially in patients who had recent cardiac surgery an enlargement of the heart figure can indicate pericardial bleeding. This patient had a change in the heart configuration and pericardial bleeding was suspected. Ultrasound demonstrated only a minimal pericardial effusion. Continue with the CT. There is a large pericardial effusion, which is located posteriorly to the left ventricle (blue arrow). The left ventricle id filled with contrast and is compressed (red arrow). At surgery a large hematoma in the posterior part of the pericardium was found. Notice that on the anterior side there is only a minimal collection of pericardial fluid, which explains why the ultrasound examination underestimated the amount of pericardial fluid. Here another patient who had valve-replacement. Notice the large heart size. There is redistribution of the pulmonary vessels which indicates heart failure. Continue with the CT. The CT-image shows a large pericardial effusion. Always compare these post-operative chest films with the pre-operative ones.
Calcifications:
Detection of calcifications within the heart is quite common. The most common are coronary artery calcifications and valve calcifications. Here we see pericardial calcifications which can be associated with constrictive pericarditis. In this case there are calcifications that look like pericardial calcifications, but these are myocardial calcifications in an infarcted area of the left ventricle. Notice that they follow the contour of the left ventricle.
Pericardial fatpad:
Pericardial fat depositions are common. Sometimes a large fat pad can be seen (figure). Necrosis of the fat pad has pathologic features similar to fat necrosis in epiploic appendagitis. It is an uncommon benign condition, that manifests as acute pleuritic chest pain in previously healthy persons (10).
Pericardial cyst:
Pericardial cysts are connected to the pericardium and usually contain clear fluid. The majority of pericardial cysts arise in the anterior cardiophrenic angle, more frequently on the rightside, but they can be seen as high as the pericardial recesses at the level of the proximal aorta and pulmonary arteries (11). Most patients are asymptomatic. On the chest x-ray it seems as if there is a elevated left hemidiaphragm. On CT however there is a cyst connected to the pericardium.
Hili:
The normal hilar shadow is for 99% composed of vessels - pulmonary arteries and to a lesser extent veins (1). The vessel margins are smooth and the vessels have branches. The left hilum should never be lower than the right hilum. The left pulmonary artery runs over the left main bronchus, while the right pulmonary artery runs in front of the right main bronchus, which is usually lower in position than the left main bronchus. Hence the left hilum is higher than the right. Only in a minority of cases the right hilus is at the same level as the left, but never higher. In this illustration the lower lobe arteries are coloured blue because they contain oxygen-poor blood. They have a more vertical orientation, while the pulmonary veins run more horizontally towards the left atrium, which is located below the level of the main pulmonary arteries. Both pulmonary arteries and veins can be identified on a lateral view and should not be mistaken for lymphadenopathy. Sometimes the pulmonary veins can be very prominent. The left main pulmonary artery passes over the left main bronchus and is higher than the right pulmonary artery which passes in front of the right main bronchus. These images are thick slab sagittal reconstructions of a chest-ct to get a better view of the hilar structures. The lower lobe pulmonary arteries extend inferiorly from the hilum. They are described as little fingers, because each has the size of a little finger (1). On the right side the little finger will be visible in 94% of normal CXRs and on the left side in 62% of normals (1). Study the CXR of a 70-year old male who fell from the stairs and has severe pain on the right flank.. Notice on the PA-film the absence of the little finger on the right and on the lateral view the increased density over the lower vertebral column. What is your diagnosis? There is a right lower lobe atelectasis. Notice the abnormal right border of the heart. The right interlobar artery is not visible, because it is not surrounded by aerated lung but by the collapsed lower lobe, which is adjacent to the right atrium. On a follow-up chest film the atelectasis has resolved. We assume that the atelectasis was a result of post-traumatic poor ventilation with mucus plugging. Notice the reappearance of the right little finger (red arrow) and the normal right heart border (blue arrow).
Hilar enlargement:
The table summarizes the causes of hilar enlargement. Normal hili are: Enlargement of the hili is usually due to lymphadenopathy or enlarged vessels. In this case there is an enlarged hilar shadow on both sides. This could be the result of enlarged vessels or enlarged lymph nodes. A very helpful finding in this case is the mass on the right of the trachea. This is known as the 1-2-3 sign in sarcoidosis, i.e. enlargement of left hilum, right hilum and paratracheal. Here some more examples of sarcoidosis. Click to enlarge.
Mediastinum:
Mediastinal masses are discussed in more detail in Mediastinal masses. Here is just a brief overview. The mediastinum can be divided into an anterior, middle and posterior compartment, each with it's own pathology.
Mediastinal lines:
Mediastinal lines or stripes are interfaces between the soft tissue of mediastinal structures and the lung. Displacement of these lines is helpful in finding mediastinal pathology, as we have discussed above.
Azygoesophageal recess:
The most important mediastinal line to look for is the azygoesophageal line, which borders the azygoesophageal recess. This line is visible on most frontal CXRs. The causes of displacement of this line are summarized in the table. A hiatal hernia is the most common cause of displacement of the azygoesophageal line. Notice the air within the hernia on the lateral view. Another common cause of displacement of the azygoesophageal line is subcarinal lymphadenopathy. Notice the displacement of the upper part of the azygoesophageal line on the chest x-ray in the area below the carina. This is the result of massive lymphadenopathy in the subcarinal region (station 7). There are also nodes on the right of the trachea displacing the right paratracheal line. On the PET we can appreciate the massive lymphadenopathy far better than on the CXR. There are also lymphomas in the neck. this is an important finding, since these nodes are accessible for biopsy. Continue with images of CT and ultrasound. Here we see a CT-image. The azygoesophageal recess is displaced by lymph nodes that compress the left atrium. The final diagnosis of small cel lungcancer was made through a biopsy of a lymphnode in the neck. First study the chest x-ray. Then continue reading. Notice the following: Combined with the above this must be a dilated esophagus with residual fluid. The final diagnosis was achalasia.
3. The density on the left in the region of the lingula is the result from prior aspiration pneumonia. Here we have a prior CXR of this patient. The AP-film shows a right paratracheal mass. The azygoesophageal recess is not identified, because it is displaced and parallels the border of the right atrium. The large round density in the left lung is the result of aspiration. Notice the massive dilatation of the esophagus on the CT.
Aortopulmonary window:
The aortopulmonary window is the interface below the aorta and above the pulmonary trunk and is concave or straight laterally. Here the AP-window is convex laterally due to a mass that fills the retrosternal space on the lateral view. On the CT-images a mass in the anterior mediastinum is seen. Final diagnosis: Hodgkins lymphoma. Here another case. On the PA-film a mass is seen that fills the aortopulmonary window. The PET better demonstrates the extent of the lymphnode metastases in this patient. Final diagnosis: small cell lungcarcinoma.
Lungs:
Lung abnormalities mostly present as areas of increased density, which can be divided into the following patterns: Less frequently areas of decreased density are seen as in emphysema or lungcysts. These lungpatterns will discussed in more detail in an article that will be published soon: Chest X-Ray - Lung disease. Consolidation Tap on image to enlarge Atelectasis
Nodule - Masses:
Tap on image to enlarge. Solitary pulmonary node - SPN is discussed here.
Interstitial pattern:
Tap on image to enlarge. Interstitial lung diseases are discussed here.
Pleura:

Pleural fluid:
It takes about 200-300 ml of fluid before it comes visible on an CXR (figure). About 5 liters of pleural fluid are present when there is total opacification of the hemithorax. Total opacification of the right hemithorax in a patient with pleuritis carcinomatosa on both sides. On the right there is only some air visible in the major bronchi creating an air bronchogram within the compressed lung. Pleural fluid may become encysted. Here we see fluid entrapped within the fissure. This can sometimes give the impression of a mass and is called 'vanishing tumor'.
Pneumothorax:
The table lists the most common causes of a pneumothorax. The other cystic lungdisease which causes pneumothorax is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) which is seen in smokers. Study the CXR. There are two important findings. The retracted visceral pleura is seen (blue arrow) which indicates that there is a pneumothorax. There is a horizontal line visible (yellow arrow). Normally there are no straight lines in the human body unless when there is an air-fluid level. This means that there is a hydro-pneumothorax. When a pneumothorax is small, this air-fluid level can be the only key to the diagnosis of a pneumothorax. Study the CXR. There are 3 important findings. Notice that the mediastinum is slightly displaced to the left. Does this mean that there is a tension pneumothorax? Do you have an idea about the cause of the pneumothorax? There is a hydropneumothorax. Notice the air-fluid level (blue arrow). The upper lobe is still attached to the chest wall by adhesions. Maybe this patient was treated for a prior pneumothorax. There is a lung cyst in the upper lobe (red arrow). So we can assume that the pneumothorax has something to do with a cystic lung disease. Since this patient is a woman, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a possible diagnosis. LAM is a rare lung disease that results in a proliferation of smooth muscle throughout the lungs resulting in the obstruction of small airways leading to pulmonary cyst formation and pneumothorax. LAM also occurs in patients who have tuberous sclerosis. Study the CXR. What is your diagnosis? This is not a pneumothorax but a skin fold. The radiography was performed supine with a CR cassette inserted underneath the patient, which resulted in a skinfold. Notice that there are lung markings beyond the apparent pneumothorax. Here two CXRs of another patient with obvious skinfolds. Recognition of a pneumothorax depends on the volume of air in the pleural space and the position of the body. On a supine radiograph a pneumothorax can be subtle and approximately 30% of pneumothoraces are undetected. A sign to look for is the 'deep sulcus sign'. It represents lucency of the lateral costophrenic angle extending toward the hypochondrium (Figure). The image is of a patient in the ICU who is on mechanical ventilation. There was an acute exacerbation of the dyspnoe. There is a deep sulcus sign on the left. Notice that the left hemidiaphragm is depressed. This is an important finding since it indicates a tension pneumothorax. The image on the right is after insertion of an intercostal drain. Notice that the diaphragm has regained its normal appearance.
Pleural opacities:
The table lists the most common causes of pleural opacities. Pleural plaquesThe CXR shows multiple opacities. They have irregular shapes and do not look like a lung masses or consolidations. Some of these opacities are clearly bordering the chest wall (red arrows). All these findings indicate that we are dealing asbestos related pleural plaques. Asbestos related pleural plaques are usually: Unilateral pleural calcifications are usually due to: Pleural hematoma These images are of a patient, who had a pleural opacity after a chest trauma. It was believed to be a hematoma and resolved spontaneously.
Chest wall:
RibfracturesThe most common identified chest wall abnormalities are old ribfractures. The CXR shows many rib deformities due to old fracturees. When a rib fracture heals, the callus formation may create a mass-like appearance (blue arrow). Sometimes a CT is necessary to differentiate a healing fracture from a lung mass. Notice the large lung volume and the enlarged pulmonary vessels. Probably we are dealing with pulmonary arterial hypertension in a patient with COPD. The second most common chest wall abnormalities that we see on a CXR are metastases in vertebral bodies and ribs. Notice the expansile mass in the posterior rib on the right.
Abdomen:
The most obvious finding on this CXR is free air under the diaphragm. This finding indicates a bowel perforation, unless when the patient had recent abdominal surgery and there is still some air left in the abdomen, which can stay there for several days. There is another subtle finding in the left upper lobe. A subtle density projecting over the first rib - hidden area - proved to be a lungcarcinoma. Here another patient with free abdominal air. Notice the very thin regular line which is the diaphragm (arrow). At first impression one might think that this is just some plate-like atelectasis due to poor inspiration. by Gerald de Lacey et al.

Horner syndrome:
Reina Sol-Kloet¹ and Sjoert Pegge²
¹University Medical Center Groningen and ²Radboud University Medical Center:
Publicationdate 2023-12-20 Horner
syndrome is a rare clinical condition presenting with partial ptosis,
miosis and facial anhidrosis described in 1869 by Johann Friedrich Horner. The
clinical symptoms allow the anatomic location of the underlying pathology
somewhere in the oculosympathetic pathway. 
Imaging plays an important role
in the final diagnosis.
Anatomy:
Horner syndrome is the result of an
interruption of the oculosympathetic nerve system which starts in the
posterolateral part of the hypothalamus and goes all the way through the brainstem and the spinal cord (level C8-Th2), cervicothoracic
sympathetic ganglia and along the internal carotid artery (and some
fibers along the external carotid artery, maxillary artery) and cavernous sinus
to the eye. Horner
syndrome can be anatomically classified into three types depending on where the
oculosympathetic pathway is interrupted: Clinically it can be difficult to
differentiate a central Horner from a pre- or postganglionic Horner.
Pharmacological testing of the eyes
with Apraclonidine or Cocaine can help make the diagnosis.
This means that in patients with a
unilateral Horner all these levels need to be examined unless other symptoms
point to a specific anatomical area.
Only in patients with a bilateral
Horner we can assume, that the pathology is located in the central neuron. Horner syndrome classically presents with: Interruption of oculosympathetic pathways leads to inactivation of the superior tarsal muscle resulting in ptosis and inactivation of the dilator muscle  producing a miosis. 
The ptosis of Horner syndrome may be subtle, often 2 mm or less and has to be distinguished from the severe ptosis in oculomotor (CN III) palsy which supplies the levator palpebrae superior and is accompanied by a dilated pupil due to a loss of innervation to the sphincter pupillae. Pre- and postganglionic causes of Horner syndrome are as common.
Central Horner syndrome is  uncommon.
Clinically frequently the central Horner syndrome goes unnoticed, because the other symptoms of brain pathology dominate the clinical picture.
Central - 1st order neuron:
The most common cause of a central Horner is infarction of the posterior-inferior cerebellar artery or
of the distal vertebral artery territory and is part of the
lateral medullary syndrome. Other causes of a central Horner are demyelination, infection or inflammation (rhombencephalitis), hemorrhage and spinal cord lesions (table). Brainstem signs suggest a brainstem
localization and indicates MRI of the brain.
Myelopathic features suggests
involvement of the cervicothoracic cord and indicates MRI of the cervical spine
and/or brachial plexus.
Hypothalamus:
These images are of a 78-year old man
who is known to have a squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth and complains of double vision.
At physical examination he is desorientated and has
dysarthria and a Horner.
Based on these findings we assume that the Horner is
caused by a central problem. Images
3D-T1 MPRAGE shows  a large ring enhancing lesion at the level
of the hypothalamus on the right and a second lesion in the right
hemisphere. Conclusion
Metastases of a squamous cell carcinoma.
Usually these carcinomas do not metastasize that easily. Continue with the next images... At other levels there were more metastases (circle).
The illustration shows the level of the pathology.
Brainstem:
These images are of a 58 year-old women with vague
neurological complains for years for which she was treated by a rehabilitation phycisian. ImagesAxial 3D-FLAIR with fat suppression shows
multiple T2 hyperintens lesions infratentorial  in the medulla oblongata on the left and

Coronal 3D-FLAIR with fat suppression shows confluent white matter lesions periventricular and infratentorial. Continue with the next images... ImagesMRI of the cervical and thoracic spine show multiple intramedullary
lesions.
Sagittal 3D-FLAIR shows multiple confluent Dawsons fingers and the axial 3D-FLAIR shows multiple T2 lesions in de brainstem. Conclusion
Radiological consistent with Multiple Sclerosis.
Spinal cord:
These images are of a 45-year old man who had a traumatic cord injury at the level of T4-5 some years ago.
He now presents with progressive pain in the legs with decreased reflexes in both arms and legs and a bilateral Horner. ImagesSagittal T2 TSE weighted images in 2021 of the cervicothoracic spine show loss of height of verterbra T4 with cord dissection and a cystic myelomalacia at this level and surrounding syringohydromyelia.
In 2022 sagittal T2W images
of the cervicothoracal spine show progressive syringohydromyelia. Continue with the next images... The Horner syndrome can be explained
by the progressive syringohydomyelia at the cervical level with disruption of
the first order neurons of the oculosympathetic pathway. Case45 year-old man with sudden onset

Contrast enhanced MRA of the neck (on the right) shows narrowing of the right vertebral artery .
The T1WFS-image of the neck shows a  hyperintense crescent signal intensity in the wall of the right vertebral artery typical of an intramural hematoma. Conclusion
Dissection of the right vertebral artery resulting in a medullary infarction. CaseThese images are of a patient who was treated with antibiotics for a persistent cough that lasted for three weeks.
She now presented at the ER with a sudden nausea, vomiting, vertigo and diplopia (double vision).
At examination she had a bilateral Horner. Images
This was a limited scan protocol (T2W and DWI) only to find out if there was any sign of ischemia.
There was no diffusion restriction (not shown) and acute ischemia was ruled out.
There is a large lesion with only limited mass-effect in the left cerebellar peduncle and there are bilateral air-fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses. Continue with the follow up scan two days later... First look at the four images.
What are the findings and what is your differential diagnosis?
You can click on the images for an enlarged view. Images DiscussionWith this kind of fast progression of the disease a tumor can be excluded.
The differential focussed on demyelinization and rhombencephalitis.
Rhombencephalitis is an inflammatory disease affecting the brainstem and cerebellum with a wide variety of etiologies, including infection, autoimmune diseases and paraneoplastic syndromes. Continue... Conclusion
Finally the most likely diagnosis was an inflammatory rhombencephalitis.
there was a slow recovery.
Preganglionic- 2nd order neuron:
Preganglionic or second order neuron is
located in the intermediolateral gray substance of the spinal cord  (ciliospinal center of Budge-Waller) between
C8 and T2. 
Postganglionic fibers exit in the ventral spinal roots C8,
T1, and T2 and pass through the inferior cervical (or stellate ganglion, fusion with
the first thoracic ganglion to form the cervicothoracic ganglion), middle
cervical ganglion thereafter synapse in superior cervical ganglion. The inferior cervical ganglion (ICG) is
located posterior to the vertebral artery between the transverse process of the C7
vertebra and the first rib.
The middle cervical ganglion (MCG) is
at the level of the cricoid cartilage C6, medial of the carotid tubercle and anterior
- superior to the inferior thyroid artery.
The superior cervical ganglion (SCG)
is located at the level of C2-C3 posterior to the carotid sheath and anterior
to the longus capitis muscle. Arm pain or hand weakness are typical
of brachial plexus lesions and indicates CT of the chest or a dedicated MR
study of the brachial plexus. Preganglionic Horner syndrome is a
common cause of Horner syndrome and most often caused by tumor or trauma.
Patients with preganglionic Horner's syndrome
often present with the classic triad: ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis and sometimes
in combination with brachial plexopathy. The most common abnormalities that
cause preganglionic Horner's syndrome are listed in the table.
Cervical ganglia:
Case
These images are of a patient with a metastatic prostate cancer, who now presents with a paralysis of the hypoglossus on the right and a left-sided Horner. First look at the images.
Where is the pathology.
Then continue reading. Images
The left hypoglossus canal is normal.
On the right there is an enhancing mass. Continue... The image on the right illustrates the enhancing mass within the hypoglossal canal. The hypoglossal canal is located between the occipital condyle and jugular tubercle and runs obliquely forwards from posteromedial to anterolateral allowing the hypoglossal nerve to exit the posterior cranial fossa. In this patient with metastatic prostate cancer we assume that it is a metastasis.
This finding however does not explain the Horner on the left. Continue... Subsequently a CT of the neck and chest was performed, which showed a prevertebral mass at the level of C7-Th1.
This is the exact location of the inferior cervical ganglion. A mass in this location explains the Horner on the left. Case
This young man was involved in a motocross accident. 
He was admitted to the ICU with multiple injuries. 
After three days he regained consciousness and a paresis of his right side was noted, which could not be explained by any cerebral injury.
He also had a Horner on the right side. Images
The CT at admission showed fractures of the transverse process of C7 and of the first rib (arrowheads).
On the CECT there was contrast extravasation indicating active bleeding (circle). Continue with the MRI... First an ultrasound of the neck was performed to look for nerve avulsion, but this examination was limited by traumatic changes in this area.
Subsequently an MRI was performed. ImagesThe
axial image shows enhancement of nerve roots indicative of a brachial plexus
injury. 
Also note the injury to the right paravertebral soft tissues. Continue.... Image
In addition the T2W-image shows some subtle high signal in the myelum on the right (arrow).
This was regarded as post traumatic myelopathy and could also be an explanation for the right-sided Horner. CaseImages of a patient with a rapidly enlarging neck mass, who complaints of swallowing problems and hoarseness.
The physical examination also detected a partial Horner with ptosis and miosis. Images
CT of the head and neck shows an
invasive thyroid mass with paralaryngeal and prevertebral extension and involvement
of thyroid cartilage (yellow arrowhead). 
There is a tumor thrombus in the jugular vein (black arrow). Continue with the next images... Images
Notice the invasion of the thyroid cartilage (yellow arrowhead).
On the edge of the scan there was a brain metastasis. DiscussonThe Horner is caused by influencing the preganglionic system. 
There are numerous fibers connecting the middle cervical ganglion (MCG) and inferior cervical ganglion (ICG), which are located anterior and posterior to the vertebral artery. Final diagnosis
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. 
This cancer is one of the most aggressive tumors and has a bad prognosis. Caseimages of a 55 year old women woman with pain in the shoulder and neck. Images
The X-ray of the cervical
and thoracic spine shows a mass projecting apically
about the right lung. 
Given the cervicothoracic sign most likely originating
from the posterior mediastinum. Differential diagnosis
The most likely diagnosis of a mass in the posterior mediastinum is: Click here for more information on mediastinal masses.
Continue with the next images... At neurologic examination a Horner syndrome on the rigth side was detected.
First a CT was performed because a possible malignancy was suspected. Images
The CT shows an encapsulated lesion in the posterior mediastium.
There is no lymphadenopathy. 
The MRI shows a well-defined lesion with T2 hyperintense signal indicating cyst or necrosis. Continue... Images
The sagittal T1W image shows rim enhancement. Conclusion
The lesion has a mass effect on the inferior cervical ganglion on the right side and that is the cause of the Horner syndrome.
The most likely diagnosis is an old schwannoma.
Postganglionic - 3rd order neuron:
The postganglionic neuron starts after the synapse of the superior
cervical ganglion at the level C2-3 where the sympathetic plexus passes posterior to the
carotid space and anterior to the longus
colli muscle. 
The neuron travels along the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus
along the n VI and n V₁ via the superior orbital fissure to the superior
tarsalis muscle, also called Muller's muscle. Sympathetic fibers traveling with the
external carotid artery follow the internal maxillary artery to the face and innervate the
sweat glands.
Postganglionic causes of Horner are as common compared as preganglionic. For pathology causing
postganglionic Horner syndrome we have to study the internal and
external carotid artery, skullbase , cavernous sinus, orbital apex and the eye. Enable Scroll

What are the findings? Images Images
Seven months later the tumor surrounding the ICA and ECA has enlarged. Conclusion
This turned out to be an adenoid cystic carcinoma with

What are the findings and most likely diagnosis? ImagesThere is a lesion in the carotid space at the bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid artery.  
On T2W the lesion is hyperintens and on T1W isointens with peper and salt appearance.
There was enhancement after contrast (image not shown). Continue with the Twist-MRA images... Examine the images.
What are the findings and most likely diagnosis? ImagesOn the TWIST MRA there is early artery enhancement in the large lesion on the right.
Notice that on the left side there is also a early arterial enhancing lesion on the carotid bifurcation. Conclusion
Bilateral paraganglioma.
Bilateral lesions are common in inherited syndromes like SDH gene mutations. Here a companion case with a paraganglioma on the left. Continue with the Twist-MRA images... Image
3D-TWIST MRA shows intense early arterial enhancement The illustration shows the level of obstruction of the postganglionic neuron. CaseImages of a 45 year old man with an asymptomatic neck mass and a Horner
syndrome at physical examination. Images Conclusion
This was a schwannoma.
A paraganglioma would have shown early enhancement on the CT image. CaseThese images are of a patient who presented with sudden problems of speaking in a fluid way.
The physiacal examination revealed an unequal size of the eyes' pupils and the impression of a hemianopsia on the right.
The patient was presented to the stroke unit.
The non-enhanced CT was normal, which excluded a hemorrhage. Images
The perfusion images show a slightly decreased cerebral blood volume (CBV) and flow (CBF) in the territory of the middle cerebral artery on the left (circle) and an increased mean transit time (MTT). This patient had a M3-occlusion, which was visible when we did scroll through the images (not shown)
However a M3-occlusion can only explain a small part of the findings on the perfusion images. In those cases you always have to study the internal carotid artery. Images
The image on the right shows the typical CTA-appearance of a carotid dissection with the flame shape a couple of centimeters above the bifurcation (arrowheads). Two weeks later and MRI was performed. Images
An intramural hematoma of the dissection is nicely shown (arrow). At that time a Horner on the left was also noted and this can be explained by the pressure by the intramural hematoma of the ICA  on the post-ganglionic system (third order neuron) travelling in the adventitia of the internal and external carotid arteries to the cavernous sinus. In these patients the Horner can resolve when the hematoma minimizes, as was the case in this patient after treatment with antiplatelet agents. Case 5This
is a similar case. Images
Notice
on the non enhanced CT on the left that the internal carotid is larger in
diameter as a result of the hematoma. On
the enhanced CT on the right the narrowed true lumen is demonstrated
(arrowhead).
Cavernous sinus:
The list of cavernous sinus pathology is extremely long and contains neoplastic, inflammatory and vascular lesions (table). Case
These images are of a 79-year-old woman who could not be examined properly because she was in fetal position and was shivering severely.
She also had a Horner syndrome on the right, but this was diagnosed later, which is not uncommon as we mentioned before.
Because of her clinical condition a CT-scan was preferred over a MRI. First study the CT.
What are the findings and what is your differential diagnosis? Images
Mass lesion on the right at the level of the cavernous sinus.
The lesion contains fat Discussion
Based on the presence of fat within the lesion the differential diagnosis was dermoid cyst and hemangioma. Continue with the MRI... Click for large view Images
The MR-images show fat located within the tumor and this is not the normal fat that we sometimes see surrounding the cavernous sinus. This patient was operated and the final diagnosis was a hemangioma.

Roadmap to evaluate ovarian cysts:
Wouter Veldhuis, Robin Smithuis, Oguz Akin and Hedvig Hricak
Department of Radiology of the University Medical Center of Utrecht, of the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands and the Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA:
Publicationdate 2011-05-15 Ovarian cancer is the second most common of all gynecologic malignancies. It is the leading cause of death in this category of diseases, frequently presenting as a complex cystic mass. The finding of an adnexal cyst causes considerable anxiety in women due to the fear of malignancy. However, the vast majority of adnexal cysts - even in postmenopausal women - are benign. In this article we will focus on specific features of ovarian cysts that are helpful in making a differential diagnosis. We will present a roadmap for the diagnostic work-up and management of ovarian cystic masses, based on ultrasound and MRI findings. In Ovarian Cystic Masses II the imaging features of normal ovaries and the most common ovarian cystic masses will be presented, as well as several less common cystic lesions.
Diagnostic work-up:
If a cystic pelvic mass is present, the first step is to find out if it is ovarian or non-ovarian in origin.
* Step 2 The next step is to determine if the lesion can be categorized as one of the common, benign ovarian masses (simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or mature cystic teratoma), or is indeterminate.
* Step 3 To aid in selecting the proper work-up, the final step is to determine whether a patient falls into a low-risk category (i.e. premenopausal women without additional risk factors) or a high-risk category (i.e. post-menopausal or premenopausal with additional risk factors). Based on these steps we can determine further management: ignore, follow-up with US, further evaluation with MRI or excision.
Role of imaging:
Role of Ultrasound For characterization of ovarian masses, ultrasound is often the first-line method of choice, especially for distinguishing cystic from complex cystic-solid and solid lesions. Role of CT CT is useful for the N- and M-staging of proven malignant lesions. Role of MRI For complex lesions, primary evaluation with ultrasound is often followed by further evaluation with MRI. Even with MRI it is often not possible to make an accurate diagnosis of neoplastic subtype. By using MRI as an adjunct to sonography a delay in the treatment of potentially malignant ovarian lesions is prevented. This is not only beneficial to the small number of women who do have ovarian cancer, but also a proven cost-effective approach to the management of sonographically indeterminate adnexal lesions.
Ovarian or non-ovarian:
If a cystic adnexal mass is present and you suspect an ovarian origin, the first thing to do is try to identify the ovaries. If the gonadal vessels lead to the lesion with no separately identifiable normal ovaries, then most likely you are dealing with an ovarian lesion. If both ovaries are separately identifiable from the lesion, you are dealing with a non-ovarian cystic lesion, or a lesion that mimics a cystic mass. The next step would be to check if there is uni- or bilateral disease and to look for any solid components that may indicate malignancy. Also look for secondary findings like ascites, enlarged lymph nodes and peritoneal deposits. The table shows a differential diagnosis for possible cystic ovarian masses. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images A helpful tool to identify the ovaries is to follow the ovarian veins caudally. Scroll through the CT-images and follow the right ovarian vein from where it joins the inferior vena cava, and the left ovarian vein where it joins the left renal vein, until you identify the ovaries.
Ultrasound pattern recognition:
Pattern recognition on ultrasound often allows a fairly confident diagnosis of common cystic ovarian masses. This means that in many cases the diagnostic work-up is based on determining the probability that we are dealing with a lesion which falls into the category of a simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or a mature cystic teratoma (commonly referred to as a dermoid cyst). Most other cystic lesions are indeterminate and therefore possibly malignant. These therefore require further evaluation, either with MRI or surgical excision.
Simple cyst:
US findings that allow a confident diagnosis of a simple ovarian cyst are: The US-image shows two simple cysts in the right ovary with ovarian stroma in between. The surrounding vessels are normal and there are no vascularized septations. These were simple follicular cysts in a premenopausal woman. Differential diagnosis Most simple cysts are functional cysts, usually follicular cysts. 
They are commonly seen in premenopausal women, but functional cysts also still do occur in postmenopausal women. Some simple cysts may turn out to be paraovarian or paratubal cysts. A hydrosalpinx may also mimic an ovarian cyst. Cystadenomas can also present as simple cysts, but they usually present as a large cyst in a postmenopausal woman. In a large cancer screening study from 1987 to 2002 including 15,106 women of 50 years or older, 2763 women (18%) were diagnosed with a unilocular ovarian cyst. None of these isolated unilocular cysts turned out to be ovarian cancer (4). In women of reproductive age, cysts up to 3 cm are a normal physiologic finding. 
These simple physiologic cysts do not need to be described in the imaging report and do not require follow-up (1). Cysts up to 7 cm in both pre- and postmenopausal woman are almost certainly benign. Cysts larger than 7 cm may be difficult to assess completely with US and therefore further imaging with MR or surgical evaluation should be considered. Normal ovaries Functional cysts Hemorrhagic cyst
Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst - HOC:
When a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. US findings that allow a confident diagnosis of a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst are: In premenopausal women short term follow-up is recommended in hemorrhagic cysts > 5 cm. The same follow-up is recommended in early postmenopausal women who have a cyst with all the characteristics of a HOC
Larger hemorrhagic cysts in the early menopause and any hemorrhagic cyst in the late menopause should be considered possibly neoplastic and MRI or surgical evaluation should be considered. Hemorrhagic cyst with a clot mimicking a neoplasm. Notice absence of flow and good through-transmission (arrow) Differential diagnosis When hemorrhagic cysts present with diffuse low-level echoes, their appearance can be similar to that of endometriomas. In the acute phase a hemorrhagic cyst may be completely filled with low-level echoes, simulating a solid mass (5). Clot in a hemorrhagic cyst may occasionally mimic a solid nodule in a neoplasm. Clot, however, often has concave borders due to retraction, while a true mural nodule has outwardly convex borders. In both cases there will be no internal flow at Doppler US and there will be good through-transmission. Hemorrhagic cysts typically resolve within 8 weeks. The ultrasound image shows multiple simple and one complex right ovarian cyst, with diffuse low-level echos and absence of flow on Doppler US. Note that there is good through-transmission, also through the complex cyst (blue arrow). On the T1 with fatsat the lesion remains bright, ruling out a fatty lesion. After Gd administration there is no enhancement, confirming that this is a cystic hemorrhagic lesion, most likely a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, although your differential may include an endometrioma. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst
Endometrioma:
US findings that allow a confident diagnosis of an endometrioma are: In women of any age, probable endometriomas require initial 6-12 week follow-up to rule out a hemorrhagic cyst. Until surgically removed, endometriomas require follow-up with ultrasound, for example on a yearly basis. This image from a vaginal ultrasound shows a large hypoechoic, cystic lesion with diffuse low-level echoes and two small echogenic foci. These have been postulated to be cholesterol deposits, but may also constitute small blood clots or debris. It is important to differentiate these echogenic foci from true wall nodules. Finding these echogenic foci makes the diagnosis of an endometrioma very likely. Endometrioma
Mature cystic teratoma:
US findings that are characteristic of a mature cystic teratoma are: Shown are transvaginal ultrasound images of two patients that demonstrate the 'tip-of-the-iceberg' sign: acoustic shadowing from the hyperechoic part of the dermoid cyst (arrow). When misinterpreted as bowel gas, the lesion may be overlooked. Mature cystic teratoma
Any other cyst - possible neoplasm:
All other cystic lesions are regarded as possibly neoplastic and therefore possibly malignant. Surgical resection is needed by an oncologic gynaecologist, who may request prior imaging-based staging. Findings indicating possible neoplasm: While benign lesions can be very large, the likelihood that a lesion is neoplastic increases with size. Also the likelihood that a neoplastic lesion is malignant, increases with the size of the lesion.
* Vascularized septations The presence of septations indicates a possible neoplasm. When septations have a thickness of more than 3mm and are well-vascularized - while non-specific - both increase the likelihood that a neoplasm is malignant.
* Vascularized solid components Vascularized nodularities, papillary projections, or frank solid masses all increase the likelihood of a neoplastic nature.
* Vascularized thick, irregular wall Lesions with thin walls are more often benign and lesions with thick, irregular walls are more often malignant. However, there is some overlap, making wall thickness a less useful criterion. For example a corpus luteum cyst may also have a thickened, vascularized wall.
* Secondary findings associated with malignant lesions: Large quantities of ascites, lymphadenopathy and peritoneal deposits are strongly associated with an increased likelihood of malignancy. Benign cystic ovarian neoplasms Malignant cystic ovarian neoplasms
Low-risk or High-risk:
Once we have determined a cystic ovarian lesion is either a probable simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or mature cystic teratoma, or is indeterminate, the next step is to place the patient in a low-risk or high-risk group (table). The final decision to ignore, follow or excise a cystic ovarian lesion is based on: That said, the great majority of cystic ovarian lesions is benign. While the risk of malignancy does increase with age, even in post-menopausal women the risk of malignancy in a simple ovarian cyst
Although complex ovarian cysts in post-menopausal women are also most often benign, they do require further work-up, because of the chance of malignancy.
'the Roadmap':
The natural history of incidentally detected pelvic masses with benign US morpgology is not known and therefore the optimal management is also unknown. The roadmap is based on the 2010 Consensus Guidelines published in (1) and (2) and on the findings in (3) and (4). The mentioned size cut-offs and follow-up frequencies are accepted practices but not ironclad rules. Local guidelines may differ based on the clinical scenario and institutional practice preferences. Many of the imaging criteria described in this article are the same for ultrasound, CT and MRI, although of course not every feature is equally detectable on all modalities. Risk factors Age is the most important risk factor for all women. Lesions in pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women are managed differently. Several other factors (see table) may place a woman in a higher risk category. Concordantly, the roadmap shows two pathways, one for lower-risk and one for higher-risk patients.
MRI protocol - which sequences, and why:
MRI protocol There are many possible 'Pelvic/Ovarian mass' protocols. The basic building blocks are simple and are the same for all protocols: A very short protocol may consist of only 1, 2 and 3 (e.g., when the request is to 'rule out an ovarian mass'). Many radiologists prefer a slightly more comprehensive protocol including 4, and often 5. When the clinical setting is characterization or staging of a known ovarian lesion, 4 (or CT) and 5 should always be included. The role of diffusion-weighted MRI is yet to be determined, but DWI is a useful aid in the detection of lymph nodes, tumors and peritoneal deposits. 
For the purpose of detection, the DW images are sometimes fused with (superimposed on) anatomical T2W images. 
DWI cannot discriminate benign from metastatic lymph nodes. Further differences in protocols all arise as variations on this simple theme. For example:
* T2W images in more than 2 planes, or obliquely angled orthogonal to the anatomic structure of interest, are often useful for cervical or uterine-body pathology.:
MR imaging is a valuable adjunct to US, as it allows identification of blood products within hemorrhagic masses that may mimic solid tumor at US. Fat-suppressed T1-weighted MR images may reveal small amounts of fat, which allows the diagnosis of a mature teratoma ('dermoid'). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging depicts features of malignancy such as enhancing mural nodules and/or enhancing solid areas with or without necrosis (3). These MR images show a lesion with high signal on T1. This indicates either blood, other high protein content or fat. On the image with fat-saturation there is suppression of the signal. This means that we are dealing with a fat-containig lesion, i.e. a mature cystic teratoma. The US image shows an echogenic lesion. The corresponding lesion has a high signal on the T1-weighted MR image.
This indicates either blood, high protein or fat. On the image with fat-saturation there is no suppression of the signal. This means that we are dealing with a blood-containig lesion, i.e. most likely a hemorrhagic cyst. by Deborah Levine et al September 2010 Radiology, 256, 943-954.

Ankle Fracture Mechanism and Radiography:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology Department of the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2010-12-15 The ankle is the most frequently injured joint. Management decisions are based on the interpretation of the AP and lateral X-rays. In this article we will focus on: Proper positioning of the ankle for radiography Trauma mechanism in ankle injuries
Trauma mechanism in ankle injuries:

Normal flexibility of the ankle:
The ankle joint has to be flexible in order to deal with the enormous forces applied exerted on the talus within the ankle fork. . The medial side of the joint is quite rigid because the medial malleolus - unlike the lateral malleolus - is attached to the tibia and the medial collateral ligaments are very strong. On the lateral side there is a flexible support by the fibula, syndesmosis and lateral collateral ligaments. This lateral complex allows the talus to move laterally and dorsally in exorotation during forward motion and subsequently pushes it back into its normal position. The fibula has no weight-bearing function, but merely serves as a flexible lateral support. The syndesmosis is the fibrous connection between the fibula and tibia formed by the anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments - located at the level of the tibial plafond (French for ceiling) - and the interosseus ligament, which is the thickened lower portion of the interosseus membrane. The anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments are often referred to as anterior and posterior syndesmosis.
Vulnerable positions of the foot:
There are two positions of the foot in which the flexible ankle joint becomes a rigid and vulnerable system: extreme supination and pronation. In these positions forces applied to the talus within the ankle mortise can result in fractures of the malleoli and rupture of the ligaments. In 80% of ankle fractures the foot is in supination. The injury starts on the lateral side, since that is where the maximum tension is. In 20% of fractures the foot is in pronation with maximum tension on the medial side. The injury starts on the medial side with either a rupture of the medial collateral ligaments or an avulsion of the medial malleolus.
Pull-off or Push-off fractures:
The shape of a fracture indicates which forces were involved.
An oblique or vertically oriented fracture indicates 'push-off'. A transverse or horizontal fracture is the result of a 'pull-off' or avulsion. On the left image the lateral malleolus is pushed off by exorotation of the talus. On the right image the medial malleolus is pulled off by the medial collateral ligament due to pronation of the foot. Ring of stability in the coronal plane
Stability:
The ankle can be thought of as a ring in which bones as well as ligaments play an equally important role in the maintenance of joint stability. If the ring is broken in one place the ring remains stable. When it is broken in two places, the ring is unstable and may dislocate. Now anyone can figure out, that an ankle is unstable when both the medial and the lateral malleoli are fractured. It becomes more problematic when there is a combination of a fracture and a ligamentous rupture, because the ligamentous rupture is not detectable on the X-ray. In some fractures there may even be a proximal fibular fracture - which is not visible on the ankle radiographs - in combination with ligamentous ruptures at the level of the ankle. It is important to realize that in these cases the radiographs of the ankle may be normal, while there still is an unstable ankle injury. Ring of stability in the axial plane There is also an ring of stability in the axial plane. When the anterior and posterior syndesmosis rupture or avulse, then the ankle joint is also unstable. There are many combinations of avulsion fractures and ligamentous ruptures that can produce an unstable ring in the axial plane. A Anteriorly the anterior syndesmosis is usually one of the first structures to rupture. When the posterior syndesmosis also ruptures, then the ankle is unstable. B Less commonly the anterior syndesmosis avulses from the tibial attachment - Tillaux fracture. C On the posterior side frequently the posterior malleolus avulses. Sometimes these fractures are difficult to detect, as we will discuss in a moment. D After the injury the bones frequently align again, which makes it difficult to detect. Stability (2) It is important to realize, that for the stability of the ankle it doesn't matter whether there is a rupture of a ligament or an avulsion at the insertion. Almost every ligamentous rupture has a fracture equivalent. Stability (3) On the left image a Weber A or SA-fracture. This ankle is stable because there is only an avulsion fracture of the lateral malleolus below the level of the syndesmosis. The ring is broken in only one place. On the right image there is an unstable fracture. The ring of the ankle is broken in two places. There is a lateral fracture and on the medial side there is a rupture of the collateral ligament allowing the talus to dislocate laterally. Stability (4) The medial clear space should not exceed 4 mm and is usually equal to the distance between the tibial plafond and the talus. Widening of the medial joint space up to 6 mm or more requires disruption of the medial collateral ligament. Stability (5) The lateral clear space is measured from the medial border of the fibula to the lateral border of the posterior tibia 1cm above the tibial plafond. It is less well defined because its width varies with positioning. Evident widening of the lateral clear space indicates syndesmotic rupture. Some state that a width of 5.5 mm is abnormal. It is very important to realize that a normal lateral or medial clear space does not exclude ligamentous rupture. It simply means that there is no dislocation, but there can still be instability. The case on the left shows a Weber B fracture. On these images the ankle fork is normal. Both the medial and lateral clear spaces are prominent, but within normal limits. We can conclude that there is no dislocation, but we do not know if there is rupture of the medial collateral ligaments or of the syndesmosis. Continue with the images post surgery. Following osteosynthesis there is obvious widening of the medial and lateral clear spaces (image on the far left). This indicates that there is a syndesmotic rupture and medial collateral ligament rupture. The ring is still broken in two places. The ankle joint is unstable and dislocated. Resurgery was necessary with placement of a syndesmotic screw to stabilize the ankle joint. Stability (6) On the left another case. There is a Weber B fracture. Both the medial and lateral clear spaces are widened, indicating instability. The talus is displaced laterally. Patient was scheduled for osteosynthesis of the fibular fracture and placement of a syndesmotic screw if necessary. After osteosynthesis of the fibula, the ankle was tested in the operating room and found to be stable. There was no indication for a syndesmotic screw. It was concluded that the syndesmosis was only partially ruptured, as is usually the case in Weber B fractures. The ring was broken in two places and after repairing one of them, the ring was stable.
Ottawa Ankle Rules:
These rules are used to determine the need for radiographs in patients with an ankle injury. Ankle X-ray series are only required in case of: Pain in the malleolar zone and any one of the following:
Radiography:

Mortise view:
A basic radiographic examination of the injured ankle consists of an AP-view, a Mortise-view and a lateral view. The Mortise-view is an AP-view taken with a 15-25? endorotation of the foot. The technologist turns the foot inwards until the lateral malleolus is at the same height as the medial malleolus. This view visualizes both the lateral and medial joint spaces. On a true AP-view the talus overlaps a portion of the lateral malleolus, obscuring the lateral aspect of the ankle joint. The distal fibula should project on the posterior part of the distal tibia
Lateral view:
Many think that for a good lateral view the distal fibula should be in the center of the distal tibia. However, since the fibula is positioned more dorsally, the fibula should project over the posterior part of the distal tibia (arrow). Malpositioning of the lateral view
Malpositioning of the Lateral view:
Malpositioning of the lateral view is the most common mistake in radiography of the injured ankle. Because the patient is in pain, the technologist is afraid to let the patient turn the ankle fully lateral. This is one of the reasons why we miss so many fractures of the posterior malleolus. The CT demonstrates a large tertius fracture. On the lateral view and also on the AP- and Mortise views, which will be shown in the paragraph on tertius fractures, this fracture was not visible. The explanation is that on the lateral radiograph the fibula projects in the middle of the tibia. The x-ray beam is not parallel to the fracture line. Since the fracture line of a tertius fracture always has this orientation, we must insist on a true lateral view. Good positioning of the lateral view - Tertius fracture On a well positioned lateral view the tertius fracture is obvious (red arrow). This was the only fracture that was seen on the x-rays of the ankle and this patient turned out to have an unstable Weber-C fracture and went for surgery. The x-ray beam has to be centered on the malleoli. Notice the exorotation of the foot for a proper lateral view.

Appendicitis - US findings:
by Julien Puylaert
Haaglanden Medical Centre in the Hague and Academical Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 05-07-2020 In this article we will discuss the role of US in appendicitis and the additional role of CT scan. The variable US features in the different stages of appendicitis will be dealt with, as well as the problem of spontaneously resolving appendicitis and the appendiceal abscess. Pitfalls and differential diagnosis are discussed here. For technique and normal anatomy: see “US of the GI tract” For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com
Introduction:
Appendicitis is still the most common abdominal emergency in the  Western world. There is a lifetime risk of 8 % to develop appendicitis, and yearly in the U.S.A  300.000 people  undergo appendectomy. The clinical diagnosis can be very difficult, and before the advent of US and CT, the negative appendectomy rate was around 30 %, while, on the other hand, initial delay of necessary surgery was also not uncommon. This US image shows an inflamed appendix in the axial (left) and longitudinal (right) view. This chapter on US  for appendicitis is meant for all those actively involved in acute abdominal US.
Pathophysiology of appendicitis:
The appendix is a blind-ending tube with a narrow lumen.
It contains feces and is easily obstructed. When obstruction occurs, within hours the intraluminal pressure increases, due to continuous secretion of mucinous fluid by the appendix mucosa. 
When this pressure exceeds the pressure in the vessels of the appendix wall, ischemic necrosis may occur, leaving the mucosa defenseless against the bacteria present in the appendix lumen Depending on the inflammatory reaction of the human defense mechanism, the pathophysiological cascade of obstruction - high pressure -  ischemic necrosis -  bacterial attack with perforation, results in a clinical presentation. This has a wide variation ranging from mild, spontaneously resolving appendicitis to life threatening perforating appendicitis, and everything in-between. In this very lean patient with early acute appendicitis, US reveals dilatation of the distal appendix. In plane A, Doppler US shows strong hypervascularization of the wall,  however in plane B no vessels are visible in the appendix wall due to high intraluminal pressure. Note the dilated, non-compressible, round appendix in B, bulging into the abdominal wall during compression (arrowheads), with only vascularization in the fatty meso-appendix. The natural course of untreated appendicitis is reflected in this table. 
Exact mortality rates in the era before surgery and antibiotics are unknown, but were probably around 10 - 20 %.   
Nowadays, mortality due to appendicitis has decreased to around 0,1 % , mainly due to early surgery, antibiotics and better diagnosis: US, CT, MRI and also the important lab value CRP. Note that in about one in five cases, appendiceal obstruction is relieved in an early phase. 
This results in spontaneously resolving appendicitis, which entity will be discussed later.
Clinical signs of appendicitis:
Courtesy: Hamilton Bailey The classic clinical signs of appendicitis are (sub)acute abdominal pain, starting in the epigastric or periumbilical area (= visceral pain-phase).
After 4 to 6 hours shifting towards the right lower quadrant (RLQ), where local peritonitis develops.However symptoms can be very atypical and treacherous, and the only constant sign is acute or subacute abdominal pain. The clinical diagnosis of appendicitis is difficult, and is often wrongly made and  initially overlooked, lea­ding to unnecessary surge­ry respec­tively to ill-advised delay. 
Before US and CT, the negative appendectomy rate reported in the literature was 28 % (Pieper R. Acta Chir Scand 1982;148: 51-62) while in-hospital delay occurred in about 20 %. US and CT as well as the use of CRP, have brought down both numbers to around 5 %.
The role of lab findings:
In the diagnosis of appendicitis the most valuable lab findings are WBC  (White Bloodcell Count) and CRP  (C- Reactive Protein). 
In early acute appendicitis, the WBC rapidly increases within a few hours and often returns to normal after 12 - 24 hours. 
The CRP remains normal during the first 6-12 hours, and then  increases, with values that -dependent  of the inflammatory reaction- vary from 30 to 500 (mg/l). In a patient with > 24 hours of symptoms and a normal CRP, the chance for appendicitis is very low.
The only exception is spontaneous resolving appendicitis. Careful matching patient’s history, lab and US findings is key. Other laboratory values are mainly valuable in the differential diagnosis of appendicitis.
US of normal vs inflamed appendix:
The US features of the normal appendix are discussed in “US of the GI tract: normal anatomy”. Differentiating an inflamed appendix from a normal one is quite easy in most cases. Normal appendix – can be visualized in 20-30 % of cases. Inflamed appendix - can be visualized in 80-90 % of cases. There is overlap between the diame­ter of the normal and inflamed appendix: The appendix diameter of normal and inflamed appendices on CT shows even a greater overlap. The explanation for this phenomenon is described in “US of the GI tract: normal anatomy”. Two asymptomatic individuals with large, feces-filled but non-inflamed appendices demonstrated by US  and CT scan. Note complete absence of inflamed fat in both.
US of appendicitis:
Appendicitis with intraluminal fecolith (arrows) is found at the level of obstruction (a and v = iliac artery and vein). The typical appearance of an inflamed appendix: In the first 6-12 hours the lumen of the appendix is strongly dilated with a thin wall and there is no inflamed fat yet. This patient presented with severe, acute periumbilical pain since 4 hours and had no localized pain over the dilated appendix. (visceral pain-phase). Note the bulging of the tense appendix in the abdominal wall (arrowheads) during compression. These appendices are easily overlooked during US examination, due to the absence of circumscribed local pain ánd due to the absence of inflamed fat. 
Moreover, these patients are often sent home without US or CT, because their visceral pain symptoms are interpreted and treated as “stomach or gallbladder problems”. Enable Scroll

Inflamed fat:
The fatty tissue that is first involved in appendicitis, is the mesentery of the appendix or meso-appendix. The normal fatty meso-appendix can be identified if outlined by some intraperitoneal fluid as in this patient, and is moderately hyperechoic, soft and well-compressible. Roughly 4-6 hours after the onset of symptoms, the inflammation begins to affect the meso-appendix, which becomes larger, more hyperechoic and non-compressible (arrowheads). The ensuing fibrin production on the serosal surface causes local peritonitis, resulting in the well-known shift of pain from the periumbilical or epigastric area to the right lower quadrant. Interestingly, in the early stages of inflamed fat, US is more sensitive than CT scan. In this patient with RLQ pain since 18 hours, CT showed only minimal fatty stranding around an 8.5 mm appendix (arrow). US with graded compression already shows unmistakable, non-compressible, hyperechoic, inflamed fat (arrowheads) around the appendix. Later on in the disease process, this fatty tissue around the appendix tends to increase in volume. This repre­sents the fatty omentum, which has migrated towards the appendix in an attempt to wall-off the imminent perforation. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Slowly applied intermittent compression is the best way to identify the non-compressible inflamed fat. Compression of the ventrally located  bowel loop also reduces the negative influence of gas. Eventually, also neighboring bowel and its mesentery become involved in the walling-off process. 
In this patient, US shows large quantities of inflamed fat (*) and the thickened ileum representing successful walling-off of the (imminent)  perforation of the appendix (arrow). 
Note a calcified fecolith (arrow on CT scan) in the appendix at a higher level. The longer this process of  “walling-off” is going on, the more difficult appendectomy  is going to be. 
This dilemma is discussed  in the chapter “appendiceal mass”.
Layer structure:
An irregu­lar, asymmetrical echolucent con­tour and loss of wall layer struc­ture indicate perforation or immi­nent perforation of the appendix. In this stage there is always abundant inflamed fat (arrowheads). The more the layer structure is affected, the higher the chance for perforation. The first sign being echolucent changes in the hyperechoic submucosa. Predicting of perforation based on the US image is not very reliable but has little therapeutic consequences at that moment.
Free fluid:
A little echolucent intra-peritoneal fluid (*) has little meaning and can be found in both acute, non-perforated appendicitis (left) and perforated appendicitis (arrow) (middle), but also in patients with a normal appendix (right). Larger quantities of fluid, especially if circumscribed and/or turbid, often accompanied by local or generalized paralytic ileus are suspect  for perforation. Usually these patients are ill, painful and have a high CRP. In this 56-year old lady with a CRP of 180, US revealed turbid intraperitoneal fluid (*) and possibly an inflamed appendix with fecoliths (arrows). CT confirmed two fecoliths in the RLQ with odd air-configurations, suspect for perforated appendicitis. US guided puncture confirmed purulent fluid. Immediate surgery revealed perforated appendicitis with four quadrant contamination of the abdominal cavity with pus.
Hypervascularization:
As shown earlier,the vascularization of the appendix wall is initially decreased due to high intraluminal pressure. 
However, this high pressure will drop again rapidly since the diseased appendix mucosa is not able to  maintain its normal fluid production anymore. 
As a result, in combination with the massive inflammatory response , strong reactive hypervascularization will occur rapidly: first in the surrounding fatty tissue and, soon after, also within the appendix wall.
Since this is the point in time, where patients usually seek medical help, this is the most familiar US image of the inflamed appendix.
Secondary signs of appendicitis:
In patients in whom the appendix cannot be visualized by US and also no alternative condition can be found, secondary signs of appendicitis may be helpful. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll In this ill and painful patient the only US findings were a generalized paralytic ileus and a little turbid free fluid (*). Note that the only movement of the bowel is from in- and expiration. Subsequent CT and surgery confirmed purulent peritonitis from perforated appendicitis. This was an ill, 67-year old woman, CRP 310. 
US showed a combination of thickened ileal loops, paralytic ileus, inflamed fat and ill-defined fluidcollections (*), but no inflamed appendix or other cause of bowel perforation. CT confirmed paralytic ileus and an inflamed appendix (arrow). 
Surgery revealed severely contaminated purulent peritonitis from perforated appendicitis.
The “appendiceal mass”:
courtesy Dr. Netter Not infrequently, patients seek medical help (or are admitted) with considerable delay (> 4-5 days). 
These patients often present with a palpable mass and relatively mild peritonitis. 
US and CT often show a large mass of non-compressible fat around the appendix, often also with wall thickening of neighboring bowel loops. If there is a circumscribed pus collection, the diagnosis is appendiceal  abscess. If not, the diagnosis is appendi­ceal phlegmon. *Choice dependent of many factors, amongst which experience and character of the surgeon.
Appendiceal phlegmon:
Patients with an appendi­ceal phlegmon are usually managed conser­vatively because the surgeon knows from experience that appendectomy in such cases is technically difficult or even impossible. The problem with the diagnosis of an appendiceal phlegmon is that there is large “grey zone” where the surgeon may not be sure whether to operate immediately or whether to opt for conservative manage­ment.
This is understandable since there is a gradual evolution from acute appendicitis to an appendiceal phlegmon. 
In the decision between surgery and wait-and-see, in general the clinical symptoms prevail over the US and CT findings. 
A walled-off pus-collection within the appendiceal phlegmon, is usually a contra indication for immediate surgery. If conservative treatment of an appendiceal phlegmon is successful, follow up US shows a decrease in size of the periappendiceal mass (arrowheads) within the course of weeks to  months. This patient was already symptom free from week three. US allows rough objectification of the palpable mass (arrowheads) around the inflamed appendix, and can be used in follow-up. This also makes underlying malignancy unlikely. One of the advantages of US over CT, is that using graded compression, US can estimate the dimensions of the “palpable” inflammatory mass (arrowheads) around the inflamed appendix. If necessary, compressibility can also be tested on CT scan,  with the help of a wooden device, strapped to the abdomen of the patient (see insert). This obese patient with advanced appendicitis and symptoms for eight days, CT with compression demonstrated a large, non-compressible inflammatory mass around the appendix. Nevertheless, the patient was immediately operated, based on clinical grounds. During operation the McBurney incision was extended at both ends, and an ileocecal resection eventually was  performed.
Appendiceal abscess:
If next to the inflamed appendix, a more or less circumscribed fluid collec­tion is found, this is suggestive for an appendiceal abscess. The collection often contains air, not infrequently (~50 %) a fecolith and is surrounded by inflamed non-compres­sible fatty tissue. The latter not only represents the omentum (“policeman of the belly”) but also the fatty epiploic appendages and fatty mesentery. Together with neighboring bowel loops, this represents the -often successful- walling-off of the appendiceal abscess in  attempt to prevent spill of pus to the peritoneal cavi­ty. Patient with a small appendiceal abscess, ventrally walled-off by the ileum. The appendix (arrows) is small because it has evacuated its purulent contents in to the abscess. Note the calcified fecolith (arrowhead) on the bottom of the abscess. Drainage was performed from laterally. Man of 70 years, with a large abscess in the RLQ. On CT the appendix could not be identified. US confirms an inflamed appendix (arrow). If an appendiceal abscess is demonstrated and there is absent or only mild peritonitis, percutaneous drainage is the treatment of choice. Dependent of symptoms and US/CT findings, acute laparotomy and wait-and-see are also options. In the majority of patients with an appendiceal abscess, percutaneous drainage is the treatment of choice. CT is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, to delineate the extent of the abscess and to determine a safe access route. Drainage using a combination of US and fluoroscopy has several advantages over CT guided drainage: it is rapid, allows continuous control, any angulation and the use of compression during the procedure. This patient had a large appendiceal abscess, walled-off by ileum and cecum. A small window (arrow) allowed US-guided puncture. Insertion of the drain over a guidewire was done under fluoroscopic control. In this obese patient, drainage with the US probe using compression, allows the needle to approach the abscess closely. Note that compression here reduced the distance skin-to-abscess from10 to 3.5 cm. Spontaneous evacuation of appendiceal abscess. a and v = right iliac artery and vein In stable patients who have no fever and only mild pain, it may be wise to await spontaneous drainage of the abscess to neighboring bowel.

US showed an inflamed appendix (arrow) with an adjacent abscess, walled-off by inflamed fat and the terminal ileum.

The appendix (arrows) was small and still had intimate contact with the ileum (il.) Another 4 years later, at age 82,  she is still doing fine. The process of spontaneous evacuation of a puscollection to neighboring bowel can be followed by doing repeated US. At the time of US, this patient with a large appendiceal abscess (arrowheads)  was feeling  much better and refused drainage. The next day he was almost symptom free after an episode with remarkably smelly stool. In hindsight two air bubbles (arrow) indicated impending evacuation of the pus to the cecal lumen. Spontaneous evacuation of a pus collection to neighboring bowel is nature’s most efficient way to get rid of an abscess or empyema. Other pathways (e.g. to the abdominal wall, to the vagina or to the bladder) are slower and may result in fistula formation. Douglas abscesses, usually evacuate itself to the rectum. 
If not, transrectal or transgluteal drainage is indicated. In this patient with a Douglas abscess the surgeon planned transrectal drainage on the OR, but was not able to locate the abscess. 
CT-guided transgluteal drainage under local anesthesia was successful. Some patients with an “appendiceal abscess” are better off with immediate surgery.
These two patients were both ill with a high CRP and signs of generalized peritonitis. 
US and CT confirmed paralytic ileus and large, not-well walled-off air-fluid collections, and in the right patient some free air (arrows). 
These combined clinical and CT findings indicate a failing defense mechanism, warranting surgery. Children often present with free perforated appendicitis, because the disease progresses more rapidly and abscess formation is less effective than in adults. Children with an appendiceal abscess usually undergo surgery. In this 11 year old girl with a ten days old large retrocecal abscess, both drainage and appendectomy was easily  performed laparoscopically. Finally, in patients with a small (< 2 cm)  abscess (*) close to the appendix (arrows) who have only 3-4 days of symptoms, immediate appendectomy with removal of the small abscess is a good option. Note the fecolith (arrowhead) In difficult cases where the anatomical situation in a patient with an acute abdomen is rather complex, communication with the surgeon is crucial. Rather than “label” a diagnosis in the US/CT report, it is better to discuss the US/CT findings together with the surgeon before the monitor.
Spontaneously resolving appendicitis:
About one in ten patients with acute appendicitis mentions one or more episodes of  the same symptoms over the past months or years, which symptoms at that point in time spontaneously subsided within a period of 12-24 hours. Laboratory shows an elevated WBC and no or only mildly elevated CRP. The increasing use of US and CT in patients with RLQ pain has learned that this phenomenon of so-called “spontaneously resolving appendicitis” is not rare. This young lady had typical signs of appendicitis for 24 hours (WBC 12 ,CRP 2). 
US  showed an inflamed appendix. 
Within a period of hours her symptoms rapidly decreased and she was not operated. US was performed 5 years later for other reasons and demonstrated a normal appendix. In this patient, the appendix (arrow) on admission showed a dilated lumen and minimal surrounding fat. After the US examination the patient had rapidly subsiding symptoms and was not operated. Three days later he was symptom free and US showed a compressible appendix (arrow) with a slightly thickened wall and a collapsed lumen and surrounded by some inflamed fat. These images, the rather sudden resolution of symptoms and the usually low CRP, suggest that the cause of this phenomenon is relief of  luminal obstructi­on at an early stage. This patient had a classic history of appendicitis but was symptom free again at the time of US. US showed a small appendix (arrows) of 6 mm, surrounded by hyperemic, non-compressible, inflamed fat.  He recalled three similar attacks over the past 9 months, and was operated immediately. Surgical and histological findings confirmed acute inflammation, with transmural infiltration with granulocytes. This young woman had pain in the RLQ for 24 hours (WBC 12, CRP 34), when she noticed rapid resolution of symptoms. 
US showed a small 6.5 mm hyperemic appendix (arrow), surrounded by inflamed fat. 
She was not operated and was symptom free the next day. 
US after 5 days showed normalization of the appendix (arrow). 
Three years later, she had recurrent symptoms and US showed acute appendicitis. 
Surgery revealed perforated appendicitis. Here the different stages of spontaneously resolving appendicitis are schematically represented. By the time patients with spontaneous resolving appendicitis undergo US, most are then in the stage of reactive hyperemia and reperfusion edema. These are US images of a strongly hyperemic, edematous but small appendix in six different patients, all with rapidly decreasing symptoms at that point in time. Note that the appendix is relatively small and has an intact layer structure.
Policy in spontaneously resolving appendicitis:
Cobben et al (Radiology 2000, 215: 349-52) followed up 60 patients with spontaneous resolving appendicitis who were not operated. Within two years 23 patients had recurrent appendicitis, and in the following 15 years, another 7. This high recurrence rate (50 %) plus the fact that a future attack may come inconveniently, may play a role in clinical decision making. It is imaginable that after each episode of appendicitis, the appendix wall becomes more vulnerable, leading to a higher chance of perforation. In recent years, more and more patients with mild appendicitis symptoms receive antibiotics. This certainly supports a rapid recovery, but it is still uncertain if the recurrence rate will go down also (see below).
Treatment of appendicitis:

Surgery:
Ever since the recognition of the pathophysiological mechanism of appendicitis by Sir Reginald Fitz in 1886, there has been little doubt about the treatment: early appendectomy before perforation can occur.
The last decades,  the famous Lanz-McBurney incision is  increasingly replaced by laparoscopic appendectomy. After conservative treatment of an appendiceal mass, a so-called interval appendectomy can be done, but the usefulness of this operation remains controversial. Until ten years ago, the use of antibiotics was limited to patients with advanced, complicated appendicitis, associated with septicaemia. 
Recently,  several studies have shown that early appendicitis can also be primarily treated with antibiotics only.
Antibiotics for early appendicitis:
Several studies have shown that a selected group of patients with acute appendicitis and mild symptoms, first attack, low CRP, no fecolith and no perforation, can be rapidly cured with antibiotic treatment alone. However,  there is a high number of late recurrences up to 40 % for whom surgery at a later moment in time is necessary (Salminen et al. JAMA 2018;320:1259-65). Another drawback of non-operative treatment is that US and CT are an uncertain gold standard. The presence of a fecolith is considered a contra-indication for primary conservative treatment of appendicitis with antibiotics. 
In this respect, there is a remarkable analogy with gallbladder stones. Once a gallbladder stone (large arrow) has been proven to obstruct the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, there is wide consensus that cholecystectomy ASAP is indicated. 
Similarly, patients with proven symptomatic obstruction of the appendix due to a fecolith (small arrow), should undergo appendectomy ASAP. Gallbladder and appendix have in common: Further studies will have to decide whether the 65 % of patients with obstructive appendicitis without a fecolith, will eventually benefit from primary antibiotic treatment.

Anal cancer staging:
Monique Maas and Doenja Lambregts
Radiology department of the Netherlands Cancer Institute Amsterdam:
Anal cancer is a rare malignancy with a worldwide
incidence of approximately 1.5 per 100.000. 
Almost all anal cancers are
squamous cell carcinomas. 
Imaging plays a vital role in the staging and
treatment planning of anal cancer. 
The diagnostic work-up consists of
proctoscopy with biopsies, MRI of the pelvis, ultrasound (with fine needle
aspiration) for the inguinal nodes, and CT or FDG-PET for the detection
of further nodal and distant metastasis. 
Chemoradiation (CRT) is the
standard treatment for most anal cancers, after which 80-90% of patients
achieve a complete remission. 
In patients with residual tumor, additional
surgery is required. 
Some patients with small tumors at the perianal skin may
be managed with primary local excision instead of CRT. 
Nodal involvement is
common in anal SCC and is usually treated with a radiation boost on the regional
lymph nodes.
Introduction:

Checklist for staging:
This is a checklist for the
structured reporting of anal cancer at baseline staging.
All these items will be discussed in the following chapters. When reporting a restaging or follow-up MRI after chemoradiation,
the report should include:
Anatomy:
Anal cancer can be
subdivided into anal canal and anal margin (perianal skin) cancer. 
Anal margin
cancers arise from the ±5 cm of perianal skin caudal from the anal margin. 
They
are often more superficial and slow-growing tumors, that may be cured with
local excision or local radiation (if T1). 
Tumors of the anal canal are often
more advanced (T2+ stage) and are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CTR). The dentate line marks the transition between columnar rectal mucosa and squamous anal
mucosa. 
Tumors above the dentate line often spread to the mesorectal, internal
iliac and obturator lymph nodes, while tumors below this line typically spread to the
inguinal and external iliac nodes.
Staging anal cancer:

T-stage:
T-stage in anal cancer is
primarily based on tumor size with the exception of T4 stage, which is invasion of adjacent organs: In the Tis category Carcinoma in situ, Bowen
disease, high-grade Squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and anal
intraepithelial neoplasia II-III (AIN II-III) are included. Choosing the right plane Note that to determine the T-stage you should measure
the longest possible tumor diameter.
To do so, be sure to evaluate the tumor in
multiple planes and look for the longest tumor dimension. Images
In this example, measuring
the tumor in the axial plane would falsely suggest a T1 tumor. 
When measuring the
longest tumor axis in the coronal plane, the tumor stage is T2.
Tumor location:
Describing the tumor location and whether the perianal skin, different layers of the anal sphincter and pelvic floor are involved does not impact the T-stage but is relevant to help guide radiation and/or surgical treatment planning. When describing involvement of the internal and external anal sphincter, it is useful to describe both the cranioucaudal extent (e.g. upper half,  lower half or full length of the anal canal) as well as the level of circumferential involvement (e.g. from … till … o’clock). When you describe the location of the tumor, mention the following: Image
A tumor  involves the distal 2/3 of the anal canal.
It invades the internal sphincter, intersphincteric space and external sphincter from ± 12 till 3 o’clock.
There is no involvement of the pelvic floor, rectum or anal margin. Image
Another example showing a tumor that involves the proximal ½ of the anal canal.
It invades the internal sphincter, intershincteric space and  external sphincter from 7-10 o’clock.
The tumor invades the puborectalis and levator ani on the right (arrow) and extends just above the level of the anorectal junction (dotted line) into the distal rectum.
N-stage:
Nodal involvement occurs in about 25-45% of patients with anal cancer.
Unlike in rectal cancer where the N-stage is based on the number of suspicious nodes, N-staging in anal cancer is based on the location of N+ nodes: Unlike in rectal cancer there are no widely accepted criteria to characterize anal cancer lymph nodes on MRI.
Some authors advise to adopt the criteria used for rectal cancer also for anal cancer staging. Other reported criteria include: These criteria do not have a strong evidence base and will inherently lead to both over- and understaging.
The most accurate nodal staging modality is 18F-FDG-PET-CT, with a sensitivity of 56-99% and specificity of 90-100% (1,2).
Ultrasound with fine needle aspiration is usually done as an adjunct to MRI and PET-CT, but in some centers it is used as the primary modality for loco-regional nodal staging. These images are of a patient with anal cancer. Images
The MRI shows a clearly enlarged node (1.5 cm short axis diameter) adjacent to the internal iliac vessels, which was staged as N+ on MRI.
FDG-PET CT showed pathologic FDG uptake in the node, confirming it as N+. In this case there are two small lymph nodes in the mesorectum that were considered as indistinct on MRI. FDG-PET showed clearly increased FDG uptake in these small nodes, showing the added benefit of PET over MRI to stage anal cancer nodes. The patient was finally staged as T2 N1a. Distant metastases in a patient with anal cancer
M-stage:
Approximately 6% of patients with anal cancer present with distant metastases at diagnosis (3,4).
The prognosis is severely impaired by distant metastases with a 5-year median overall survival of only 10-20%. The most common sites of distant metastasis are distant lymph nodes like common iliac nodes, para-aortic nodes and nodes above the diaphragm, followed by liver and lung metastases.
The recommended staging modality for M-staging in anal cancer is FDG-PET as almost all anal cancers are squamous cell cancers, which show clearly increased metabolic FDG uptake on PET.
Alternatively, a portal venous phase CT of the chest and abdomen may be performed. Images
Two distant metastases that are clearly FDG-avid on PET:  a suspicious nodule in the right lung and a distant para-aortic lymph node.
Restaging and follow-up after treatment:
Tumor (arrow) before treatment with a suspicious mesorectal node. Stage: cT2N1a. As mentioned before, when reporting a restaging or follow-up MRI after chemoradiation, the report should include: The vast majority of anal cancers undergo definitive
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) which leads to a complete remission in ±80-90% of the
patients. 
Maximum response rates are achieved after ±6 months at which time final
response evaluation with restaging should be performed. The main goal of restaging is
to identify the ±10% of patients that still have vital residual tumor and
require additional surgical resection. 
During restaging the diffusion-weighted
images are particularly helpful to detect residual tumor. Chemoradiation induces fibrosis with low signal on T2W images. 
Absence of intermediate
to hyperintense residual signal on T2W images and absence of diffusion
restriction on DWI are signs that are highly predictive for a complete
response. Images
Tumor (arrow) before treatment
with a suspicious mesorectal node.
Stage: cT2N1a.
Continue with the images after treatment... Restaging After treatment the
tumor has decreased in size. There
is no residual intermediate signal mass on the sagittal and axial T2W images. There
is only a small area of hypointense fibrosis 
(arrows). The
small dark spot on the ADC map represents ‘dark
through’ from
fibrosis (arrow). 
This can be distinguished
from true diffusion-restriction, since there is no corresponding high signal on
the high b-value diffusion-weighted images. Anal tumor in the middle and lower third of the anal canal before treatment.
Pitfall: timing of response:
To assess the final
response to treatment and decide whether or not to operate, imaging is best
performed ±6 months after completion of chemoradiation. If imaging is performed earlier, response
may still be ongoing and presence of residual tumor is highly likely. Some centers perform MRI at 6-10 weeks after chemoradiation.
These images should be regarded as an interim evaluation and baseline for
further follow-up. 
Apart from MRI, clinicians will generally monitor response
by digital rectal examination (DRE) and clinical inspection.  
When DRE is not feasible or if clinical
examination results in inconclusive findings, MRI can be used as an adjunct to
further assess the response. Images

Continue with the follow up... Residual tumor 6 weeks post chemoradiation. Evaluation after 6 weeks
The
first response evaluation was performed 6 weeks after the last
radiation fraction. ImagesThere is response, but residual tumor is still visible as intermediate
signal tissue on T2W MRI (black arrow) with corresponding diffusion restriction
(white arrow). Continue with the follow up at 6 months... No residual tumor 6 months post chemoradiation. Evaluation after 6 months
A second response
evaluation was performed at 6 months post-radiation. Images
There is a complete response.
Local recurrence:
Local recurrence is defined as biopsy confirmed reappearance of tumor or locoregional lymph nodes after an initial complete response, at least 6 months after the last radiation fraction. Approximately 30% of patients treated with CRT will eventually have local failure (i.e. residual tumor after CRT or local recurrence during follow up).
About half of the recurrences occur in the first 2 years after completion of CRT.
Basaloid subtypes, higher stage tumors and HIV positive patients have a higher risk for local recurrence.
Basaloid carcinoma is a distinctive morphologic subtype of squamous cell carcinoma frequently associated with the human papilloma virus. Anal cancer before chemoradiation Local
recurrence is seen as a new intermediate signal mass on T2W with restricted diffusion on DWI or nodes showing growth during
follow up. FDG-PET-CT can be used to confirm or rule out a local recurrence and simultaneously
look for distant metastasis. 
Early detection of a local recurrence improves the
chance of successfull salvage surgery, which usually means abdominoperineal resection. Images
This is an anal cancer before chemoradiation.

There is a complete response with only a small thin area of fibrosis at the former tumor location at 1-3 ‘o clock in the internal sphincter (arrow).
There was no signs of diffusion restriction (scroll).
The rest of the internal sphincter shows some fuzzy intermediate to high signal, which represents radiation-induced edema (which shows no diffusion restriction). Continue with the images after 2 years... Local recurrence 2 years after completion of CRT Images
There is a local recurrence 2 years after completion of CRT.
Note that the recurrence is larger than the primary tumor.
Extended abdomino-perineal resection after re-irradiation was required to salvage this recurrence.
Imaging protocol:
The recommended MRI protocol mainly consists of high resolution T2W
imaging in multiple planes with a slice thickness of ≤ 3 mm. Diffusion-weighted imaging is mainly crucial in the restaging and
follow-up setting because it increases the sensitivity of MRI to help detect
areas of vital residual tumor within the fibrotically changed tumor bed. MRI
has a limited performance for N-staging and patients require additional
FDG-PET/CT and/or ultrasound (with FNA) to more accurately assess the lymph
nodes.
Sequence angulation:
High resolution coronal T2W sequences are planned parallel to the anal canal to allow optimal visualization of the
different layers of the anal canal. Transverse sequences are planned perpendicular to the anal canal Note that anal cancer may present with ‘skip lesions’
occurring at a distance from the primary tumour, i.e. higher up in the rectum
or mesorectal compartment. 
Be sure to check for the presence of any
skip lesions on the large FOV images of the pelvis. Image
There is a primary tumor located in the anal canal, presenting with a large skip
lesion in the mesorectum (arrow).
Anal cancer versus rectal cancer.:
The table summarizes the main differences in staging and treatment between anal and rectal cancer. Note that the definition of anal versus rectal cancer is based on the histology of the tumor and not its location.
Anal cancers are typically squamous cell carcinomas, while rectal cancers arise from large bowel mucosa and are typically adenocarcinomas. Anal cancers may extend above the anorectal junction into the distal rectum or even be largely situated in the rectum.
Vice versa rectal cancers may extend into or be located for the majority within the anal canal. 
When performing anal or rectal cancer staging, the radiologist thus needs to be informed about the underlying tumor histology to apply the correct TNM-staging. The definitions for T4 disease are different for anal and rectal cancer.
Unlike in rectal cancer, invasion of the external sphincter (*) and pelvic floor muscles (*) is not T4 disease when staging anal cancer. This example shows a tumor with a maximal diameter of 4.7 cm.
On the axial view the tumor involves the internal sphincter from 4-8 o’clock.
It extends into the intersphincteric plane and invades the levator ani on the right dorsal side (arrow).
In case of anal cancer this is staged as T2 (diameter 2-5 cm), while in case of a rectal cancer, the invasion of the external sphincter and levator ani would constitute a T4 stage.

Cervical injury:
Adam Flanders
Department of Radiology and Regional Spinal Cord Injury Center of the Delaware Valley, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia:
Publicationdate 2008-11-24 This review is based on a presentation given by Adam Flanders and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Approximately 3 % of patients who present to the emergency department as the result of a motor vehicle accident or fall have a major injury to the cervical spine. 10-20% patients with head injury also have a cervical spine injury. Up to 17% of patients have a missed or delayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury, with a risk of permanent neurologic deficit after missed injury of 29%. Most cervical spine fractures occur predominantly at two levels. One third of injuries occur at the level of C2, and one half of injuries occur at the level of C6 or C7. In this overview we will discuss the most common cervical spine injuries. You can click on some of the images to get a larger image.
Introduction:
Hyperflexion injuriesClick on the image to get a larger view.
Flexion injuries:
The most common fracture mechanism in cervical injuries is hyperflexion. Since the anterior and middle columns remain intact, this fracture is stable.
* Simple wedge fracture is the result of a pure flexion injury. The posterior ligaments remain intact. Anterior wedging of 3mm or more
suggests fracture. Increased concavity along with increased density due to bony impaction. Usualy involves the upper endplate.
* Unstable wedge fracture is an unstable flexion injury due to damage to both the anterior column (anterior wedge fracture) as the posterior column (interspinous ligament).
* Unilateral interfacet dislocation  is due to both flexion and rotation.
* Bilateral interfacet dislocation  is the result of extreme flection. BID is unstable and is associated with a high incidence of cord damage.
* Flexion teardrop farcture  is the result of extreme flection with axial loading. It is unstable and is associated with a high incidence of cord damage.
* Anterior atlantoaxial dislocation Hyperextension injuries
Extension injuries:
Traumatic spondylolisthesis of C2.
* Extension teardrop fracture
* Hyperextension in preexisting spondylosis 'Open mouth fracture'.
Axial compression injuries:

Stability:
Unstable fractures: Non-hemorrhagic and hemorrhagic spinal cord injury
Spinal cord injury:
There are two types of injury to the spinal cord: Effect of spinal cord hemorrhage on motor recovery of the legs at 12 months There is a strong correlation between the length of the spinal cord edema and the clinical outcome. The most important factor however is whether there is hemorrhage, since hemorrhagic spinal cord injury has an extremely poor outcome. The chart on the left is showing the motor recovery rate for patients with edema alone (in blue) versus edema plus cord hemorrhage (in red). The motor recovery rate is for the legs only. Central spinal cord injury in a patient with a hyperextension injury and preexisting spondylosis and stenosis. Spinal cord syndromes (2): Brown-Sequard Syndrome after stab wound with screwdriver On the left images of spinal cord injury after a stab wound with a screwdriver. This resulted in a Brown-Sequard syndrome due to hemisection of the spinal cord.
Hyperflexion injuries:
Hyperflexion sprain without fracture
Hyperflexion Sprain:
Hyperflexion sprain injuries are injuries to the soft tissues of the spine without fracture. On x-rays this can only be suspected when there is angulation or translation MR will demonstrate subtle injuries to the soft tissues. On the left images of a patient who has been in a car accident and complained of neck pain. The x-rays were normal and there were no neurological symptoms. First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The findings are: In this patient we can conclude that there was mild hyperflexion strain and we do not know if a special treatment is required, since these were isolated MR-findings without evidence of fracture or abnormal positioning. There is controversy regarding the meaning of soft tissue abnormalities detected only on MRI. Signal changes do not necessarily equate with structural failure. These findings still require better validation. In trauma centres up to 25% of all patients with neck injury have signal abnormalities on MR and the significance is indeterminate. Hyperflexion sprain Hyperflexion sprain (2) On the left images of a 44 year old female, who sustained a fall on the ice. She subsequently had a second fall the following morning, where after she had complete loss of motor and sensation. On physical examination there was lower extremity paraparesis with some upper extremity weakness on the right. Central cord injury was proposed initially. The radiographs were normal. First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The findings are: These CT-findings are very subtle and do not seem to match the neurological problem. In such a case MRI is the next step. First we show you a coronal and axial CT with also a soft tissue window-setting. There is high density material at the back of the disc space, which is very suggestive for a traumatic disc herniation. A epidural hematoma should be in the differential, but this finding was limited to just the area of the disc space, unlike a hematoma. Continue with the MR. Hyperflexion sprain with spinal cord injury Hyperflexion sprain (3) The MRI explains the neurological status of this patient. First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The MR-findings are: Continue with the axial image. Vertebral artery thrombosis: no flow void in the right vertebral artery The axial image shows the spinal cord injury and in addition to it there is absence of flow void in the right vertebral artery. This indicates thrombosis as a result of dissection. In conclusion we can say that this patient had no fracture, but a severe hyperflexion sprain with acute disc herniation, non-hemorrhagic spinal cord injury and vertebral thrombosis. Right vertebral artery thrombosis The MRA confirms the occlusion of the right vertebral artery.
Unilateral interfacet dislocation:
Unilateral interfacet dislocation is due to a hyperflexion injury with rotation. The superior facet on one side slides over the inferior facet and becomes locked. This results in an anterior subluxation of the upper vertebral body of about 25% of the AP diameter of the body. Simple unilateral facet dislocation is a stable injury. 30% of patients have an associated neurologic defect. MRI plays an important role in the diagnosis in order to see if there is disc extrusion leading to cord compression. On the left images of a 20 year old male who had a rollover motor vehicle accident. First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The radiographic findings are: The CT confirms the unilateral dislocation. The contralateral facetjoint is only distracted. Inverted hamburger sign in unilateral interfacetal dislocation Unilateral interfacetal dislocation (2) On the axial view the left facet joint is normal and the configuration has similarities with the hamburger. On the right side the classic 'inverted hamburger sign' is seen. Continue with the MR-images Unilateral interfacetal dislocation First study the MR-images. Then continue reading. The MRI-findings are:
Bilateral Interfacetal Dislocation:
Bilateral interfacetal dislocation (BID) is the result of extreme hyperflection. There is anterior dislocation of the articular masses with disruption of the posterior ligament complex, posterior longitudinal ligament, the disc and usually also the anterior longitudinal ligament. When the dislocation is complete, the dislocated vertebra is anteriorly displaced one-half of the AP diameter of the vertebral body. Because of its extensive soft tissue damage and dislocated facet joints, BID is unstable and is associated with a high incidence of cord damage. Bilateral interfacetal dislocation First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The findings are: On the left CT-images of the same patient, which confirm the bilateral dislocation. Near one of the facets there is a small fleck of bone, but there is no major fracture, so this is basically just a hyperflexion soft tissue injury. Double inverted hamburger sign in bilateral facetal dislocation On the axial images the inverted hamburger sign is seen on both sides. Enable Scroll

--> Reduction under fluoroscopy:
In order to regain normal alignment, progressive weights are used to lengthen the spine until reduction is achieved. Scroll through the images on the left. Notice, that with 60 pounds the facets start to move, but it finally takes about 110 pounds before the neck is reduced. Because someone is holding on to the neck while more weight is added, an actual 'clunk' can be felt in the neck indicating that reduction is achieved. Continue with the MR-images after reduction. Bilateral interfacetal dislocation (5) On the left images of a 15-year old, who was injuried during wrestling. There is 50% anteroposition of C3 on C4 as a result of bilateral interfacetal dislocation. There is complete disruption of the posterior complex. This boy had severe neurologic deficit. Bilateral interfacetal dislocation (6) On the left another bilateral interfacetal dislocation with complete transsection of the cord. This is a very uncommon finding, since the spinal cord is very plastic. Flexion tear drop fracture
Flexion tear drop fracture:
This fracture is the result of a combination of flexion and compression,
which is usually the result of a motor vehicle accident. The teardrop fragment comes from the anteroinferior aspect of the vertebral body. The larger posterior part of the vertebral body is displaced backward into the spinal canal. On x-rays the facet joints and interspinous distances are usually widened and the disk space may be narrowed. 70% of patients have neurologic deficit. It is an unstable fracture associated with complete disruption of ligaments and anterior cord syndrome. Flexion tear drop fracture due to diving injury On the left images of a 21 year old male who sustained a diving injury, striking his head in a swimming pool. He had immediate onset of upper and lower extremity weakness. First study the images. Then continue reading. The findings are: Some would just call this a severe hyperflexion injury, but this entity is better known as a 'flexion tear drop' fracture. Look for additional findings on the CT-images and then continue reading. The findings are: In fact these vertebral bodies kind of 'exploded' with propulsion of a bone fragment anteriorly (teardrop) and the larger part posteriorly against the spinal cord. Continue with the MR-images. Flexion tear drop fracture (2) Look for additional findings on the MR-images and then continue reading. The findings are: Flexion tear drop fracture (3) On the left images of a similar case. There is a C5 flexion teardrop fracture. Notice that the lower cervical area is not visualised well and additional imaging is required. The CT-images demonstrate the extreme axial loading. The tear drop fragment is displaced anteriorly and the larger part of the vertebral body is displaced posteriorly compressing the spinal cord. Continue with the MR-images. T1W- and T2W-images with fatsat. The MR-images demonstrate the spinal injury. It is a hemorrhagic injury, which has a poor outcome. Also notice the posterior ligamentous injury as a result of the hyperflexion with rupture of the ligamentum flavum and CSF leakage. Central spinal cord injury Notice the central location of the spinal cord injury.
Hyperextension injuries:

Hangman' s fracture:
The Hangman' s fracture is the most common cervical spine fracture. Classically it is an extension-fracture as the hangman puts the knot under the chin to produce maximal extension-force. That is why we discuss the hangman' s fracture in the chapter on hyperextension injuries. In some situations however it can also be the result of extreme flexion. The hangman's fracture is common in diving accidents. Although considered an unstable fracture, it seldom is associated with spinal injury, since the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal is greatest at this level, and the fractured pedicles allow decompression. When associated with unilateral or bilateral facet dislocation at the level of C2, this type of hangman's fracture is unstable and has a high rate of neurologic complications. Classification of Hangman' s fractures Hangman' s fracture type I On the left images of a restrained passenger in a vehicle going about 55 miles per hour . She ran into a tree at about 9 p.m. the previous night with questionable loss of consciousness. She had cervical tenderness to palpation, but was alert and had no neurologic abnormalities on examination. First study the images on the left.
Then continue reading. The findings are: Continue with the CT-images. The CT-images confirm the fracture-lines of the hangman's fracture. They run through the pars interarticularis resulting in a traumatic spondylolysis. In this case there was no neurologic deficit, because the spinal canal is widened at the level of the fracture. Hangman' s fracture type I On the left images of another patient with a type I Hangman' s fracture. There is a hair-line fracture and there is no displacement.
Hyperextension with superimposed spondylosis:
On the left images of a 90-year-old male who tripped and fell on his back and the back of his head. He had immediate quadriparesis after the event with no loss of consciousness. First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The findings are: Continue with the CT-images. On CT we also see that there has been a hyperextension injury. The small black dots in the disc space are the result of a vacuum phenomena. The negative pressure resulted in a vacuum phenomena in the injured disc space. There is also some hyperdensity at the back of C5C6, which could be a herniated disc or just preexisting disc degeneration. In such a patient with spondylosis which has led to narrowing of the canal, a low velocity injury can lead to spinal cord injury. Continue with the MR-images. The MR shows a subtle increase in signal intensity of the spinal cord. Most of the time these patiets get a central cord injury. There is only injury to the central part of the cord and these patients have disproportioned weakness of their arms and normal strength in their legs. These injuries can be devastating, although it is uncommon that they are hemorrhagic. Hyperextension with superimposed spondylosis Hyperextension injury (3) On the left two other examples of this hyperextension injury. It is easy to find the injured disc, since it is the one with the high signal (arrows). Notice the prevertebral soft tissue swelling in the case on the right.
Extension teardrop fracture:
As with flexion teardrop fracture, extension teardrop fracture also manifests with a displaced anteroinferior bony fragment (6). This fracture occurs when the anterior longitudinal ligament pulls a bony fragment away from the inferior aspect of the vertebra because of the sudden hyperextension. The fragment is a true avulsion, in contrast to the flexion teardrop fracture in which the fragment is produced by compression. This type of fracture is commonly seen in diving accidents and tends to occur at lower cervical levels. It also may be associated with the central cord syndrome due to buckling of the ligamenta flava into spinal canal during the hyperextension phase of injury. This injury is stable in flexion but highly unstable in extension. On the left images of a 70 year old female who fell down ten steps striking her head resulting in a subgaleal hematoma with possible loss of consciousness. There was no neurologic deficit. Notice the anteroinferior bony fragment of C2. Continue with the CT images. The CT confirms the displaced anteroinferior bony fragment. This fragment is a true avulsion, in contrast to the flexion teardrop fracture in which the fragment is produced by compression of the anterior vertebral aspect due to hyperflexion. Continue with the MR images. The MR also confirms that this is not a flexion injury, since the soft tissue injury is located anteriorly. Extension-teardrop fracture (2) On the left another extension-teardrop fracture of C2.
Fractures due to axial loading:

Jefferson fracture:
This fracture is caused by a compressive downward force that is transmitted evenly through the occipital condyles to the superior articular surfaces of the lateral masses of C1. This process displaces the masses laterally and causes fractures of the anterior and posterior arches, along with possible disruption of the transverse ligament. Radiographically the fracture is characterized by bilateral lateral displacement of the articular masses of C1.
Other injuries:

Odontoid fracture:
Odontoid or dens-fractures are very common. They are seen in elderly, but also frequently in children due to the relatively large head-to-spine ratio. Classification This is a rare fracture. 
It is stable, since the fracture line is above the transverse ligament.
* Type II: Through the base of the dens. 
Most common fracture. 
Always unstable and poor healing.
* Type III: Fracture through the body of the axis and sometimes facets.
 Can be unstable, but has a better prognosis than type II due to better healing of the fracture which runs through the metaphyseal bone of the body of C2. Odontoid fracture type II On the left the most common type of odontoid fracture, which is type II through the base of the odontoid. These type II fractures have a tendency to nonunion, which occurs in 64%. Odontoid fracture type II On the left another type II odontoid fracture. Sometimes these fracture-lines can be difficult to see. Prominent mach line mimicking an odontoid fracture There are fracture mimics like lucent lines as a result of overprojection or a prominent mach line (figure). Odontoid fracture (2) On the left images of a 26-year-old unrestrained passenger in a MVC who was ejected from the automobile. He had multiple injuries including subdural hematoma, hemothorax, epidural cord bleed, and a T-spine fracture, left L3 transverse process fracture as well as a left clavicle fracture. There was no neurologic deficit at physiacl examination. First study the images, then continue reading. The findings are: Look at the CT-images and then continue reading. Odontoid fracture type III The CT confirm the x-ray findings and shows two additional findings: Continue with the MR-images The MR demonstrates: On the left transverse MR-images at the level of the cervical spine and the thoracic spine. Notice that at the thoracic level, there is also a epidural fluid collection, but it is located posteriorly. This resuted from the T-spine fracture. Continue with the axial images. Type III odontoid fracture Odontoid fracture (3) On the left coronal CT-images of another type III odontoid fracture. Unstable type II odontoid fracture Odontoid fracture (4) On the left images of a type II unstable odontoid fracture. Unstable type III odontoid fracture On the left an unstable type III odontoid fracture. Harris' measurement for AO-DissociationRule of twelves= distance from tip of dens to basion or from basion to posterior line should not exceed 12 mm in an adult.
Atlanto-occipital dislocation:
Atlanto-occipital dislocation is an uncommon injury characterized by complete disruption of all ligaments between occiput and atlas with subluxation or complete dislocation of the occipitoatlantal factes. Anterior translation of the skull on the vertebral column is the most common presentation. Death usually occurs immediately from stretching of the brainstem, which causes respiratory arrest. It is reported to occur in 31% of fatal MVAs. It is more common in children due to the larger head. Up to 50% of atlanto-occipital dislocations are overlooked initially, which can have catastrophic results, since cervical traction can be fatal. Power's ratio is sometimes used as a measurement for the relationship between skull base and spine, but Harris' measurement for AO-dissociation has a greater sensitivity (figure). On the left images of an unrestrained passenger, who was ejected from a vehicle and found confused and combative at the scene. He was intubated and taken to a hospital, where he was found to be quadriplegic. On the scout view the abnormal relationship between skull and cervical spine is seen. The axial CT-image demonstrates blood surrounding the brainstem. On the images on the left notice the abnormal relationships of the basion, opisthion and the tip of the dens and the posterior arch of the atlas. The subarachnoid space is hyperdense due to the hemorrhage (arrow). On the left the MR-images. Notice the prevertebral hemorrhage and the compression on the cord.

Acute Pancreatitis:

2012 Revised Atlanta Classification of Acute Pancreatitis:
Thomas Bollen, Marieke Hazewinkel and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the St. Antonius hospital, Nieuwegein, the Medical Centre Alkmaar and the Rijnland hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2015-05-01 The 2012 Revised Atlanta Classification of acute pancreatitis enables standardized reporting which is helpful for communication between clinicians and for research. A standardized template for reporting CT images is given to describe the local complications of acute pancreatitis.
Introduction:
Temporally, two phases of acute pancreatitis are identified in the Revised Atlanta Classification: Only clinical parameters are important for treatment planning and are determined by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome - SIRS, which can lead to organ failure.
2. Late - after the first week Morphologic criteria based on CT findings combined with clinical parameters determine the care of the patient. The severity is classified into three categories based on clinical and morphologic findings: 15-20% of cases. Morphologically, there are two types of acute pancreatitis:
Diagnosis of Acute Pancreatitis:
The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features: Acute onset of persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back.
2. Serum lipase or amylase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal.
3. Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) and less commonly MRI or US. The diagnosis is usually established when there is a combination of abdominal pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes and CECT is not required, unless there is uncertainty about the diagnosis. These images are of a patient who presented with acute severe epigastric pain very suggestive of acute pancreatitis. However the amylase level was within normal levels. A CECT was performed. The findings are: There were no complications and the diagnosis of mild pancreatitis was made.
Clinical outcome:
Early severity stratification of acute pancreatitis is important to identify patients with the highest morbidity. These patients may benefit from timely transfer to the intensive care unit or tertiary referral centre. Mild pancreatitis These patients have no organ failure. Most of them have no fluid collections and no necrosis. These patients usually recover by the end of the first week. Moderate severe and severe pancreatitis The clinical condition of the patient is determined by the host response to the pancreatitis. Cytokine cascades result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which increases the risk of organ failure. The presence of organ failure is determined by respiratory (pO2↓), renal (creatinine↑) and cardiovascular failure (blood pressure↓). The extent of morphologic changes like necrosis and fluid collections is not directly proportional to the severity of organ failure. Many of these patients however will have necrotizing pancreatitis and the mortality increases when the necrosis becomes infected.
Atlanta Classification of Fluid Collections:
The 2012 Revised Atlanta Classification discerns 4 types of peripancreatic fluid collections in acute pancreatitis depending on the content, degree of encapsulation and time. On CT, the discrimination between an APFC and ANC may be difficult, especially in the first weeks and the term "indeterminate peripancreatic collections" can be used. All these collections may remain sterile or become infected. Infection is rare during the first week. The table summarizes the CT criteria for pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections in acute pancreatitis. Acute Peripancreatic Fluid Collections contain fluid only and are not or only partially encapsulated. They are seen within 4 weeks in interstitial pancreatitis. Frequently they regress spontaneously.
2. ANC Acute Necrotic Collections contain a mixture of fluid and necrotic material. They are not or only partially encapsulated. They are seen within 4 weeks in necrotizing pancreatitis.
3. PseudocystAfter 4 weeks in interstitial pancreatitis. This fluid collection is encapsulated. Pseudocysts are uncommon in acute pancreatitis. Most persistent fluid collections also contain some necrotic material.
4. WONAfter 4 weeks most necrotic collections are fully encapsulated and are called Walled-off Necrosis (WON).
CT severity index:
The CT severity index (CTSI) combines the Balthazar grade (0-4 points) with the extent of pancreatic necrosis (0-6 points) on a 10-point severity scale. On the day of admission, scoring systems based on imaging do not outperform scoring systems based on clinical and biochemical parameters with regard to predicting clinical outcome. Therefore, performing CT on day of admission solely for prediction purposes is not recommended.
Imaging:

CT:
CT is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis and staging of acute pancreatitis and its complications.
Ultrasound and ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction play an important role in biliary pancreatitis. Since the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is usually made on clinical and laboratory findings, an early CT is only recommended when the diagnosis is uncertain, or in case of suspected early complications such as bowel perforation or ischemia. An early CT may be misleading regarding the morphologic severity of the pancreatitis, because it may underestimate the presence and amount of necrosis. The images show a normally enhancing pancreas on day 1. As the patient's condition worsened, a second CT was performed on day 3. Notice how the greater part of the pancreatic body and tail no longer enhances indicating necrotizing pancreatitis (arrows). The first CT underestimated the severity of the pancreatitis. This patient died on day 5 due to severe SIRS and multiple organ failure.
Interstitial pancreatitis:
Morphologically there are 2 types of acute pancreatitis - interstitial or oedematous pancreatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis.. Here an example of interstitial pancreatitis. There is normal enhancement of the entire pancreatic gland with only mild surrounding fatty infiltration. There are no fluid collections and there is no necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma. CTSI: 2 points. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Here another case of interstitial pancreatitis without necrosis. Scroll through the images. The pancreas is swollen and there is peripancreatic inflammation (2 points). No fluid collections. No pancreatic necrosis. CTSI: 2 points
Necrotizing Pancreatitis:
Necrosis of pancreatic parenchyma or peripancreatic tissues occurs in 10-15 % of patients. It is characterized by a protracted clinical course, a high incidence of local complications, and a high mortality rate. There are 3 subtypes of necrotizing pancreatitis: Necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma can be diagnozed on a contrast-enhanced CT ⩾ 72 hours. Necrosis of peripancreatic tissue can be vary difficult to diagnose, but is suspected when the collection is inhomogeneous, i.e. various densities on CT.. The CT shows an acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The body and tail of the pancreas do not enhance. There is normal enhancement of the pancreatic head (arrow). More than 50% of the pancreas is necrotic and there are at least two collections. CTSI: 4 + 6 = 10 points.
MRI:
MRI is superior to CT in differentiating between fluid and solid necrotic debris. Here a patient with several homogeneous peripancreatic collections on CT. These collections also show homogeneous high signal intensity on a fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI image, are fully encapsulated and contain clear fluid (i.e. pseudocysts). This patient had an acute necrotizing pancreatitis with onset 2 months earlier. The CT-image shows a homogeneous peripancreatic collection in the transverse mesocolon (arrow). A T2-weighted MRI sequence shows that the collection has a low signal intensity (arrow). Most likely this is necrotic fat tissue (i.e. sterile necrosis or walled-off necrosis). This patient had no fever or signs of sepsis. Endoscopic or percutaneous drainage would have little or no effect on its size, but increases the risk of infection.
Peripancreatic Collections:
Spontaneous regression of APFC.
Acute Peripancreatic Fluid Collection - APFC:
Intraabdominal fluid collections and collections of necrotic tissue are common in acute pancreatitis. These collections develop early in the course of acute pancreatitis. In the early stage, such a collection does not have a wall or capsule. Preferred locations of fluid collections are: These collections are the result of the release of activated pancreatic enzymes which also cause necrosis of the surrounding tissues. This explains why many of these collections harbor solid necrotic debris. About 50% of these collections show spontaneous regression (figure). The remaining 50% either remain stable or increase and undergo organization and demarcation with liquefaction. They may remain sterile or develop infection. The images show spontaneous regression of an acute peripancreatic fluid collection (APFC).
Acute Necrotic Collection - ANC:
Study the image. What are the findings? Then continue reading. The findings are: We can conclude that this is an acute necrotic collection - ANC. ANC (2) Study the images and then continue reading. What are the findings? The findings are: On day 5 this collection can be diagnosed as probable acute necrotic collection. On day 18 an incomplete wall is present, but we can assume that in a couple of days this will be a walled-of-necrosis with a complete wall. When peripancreatic collections persist or increase, it is usually due to the presence of fat necrosis. Because fat does not enhance on CT, the diagnosis of fat necrosis can be difficult. Necrosis can be diagnosed with MRI, which of course should only be performed if it has direct clinical implications. Pseudocyst
Pseudocyst:
This patient presented with a gastric outlet obstruction 2 months after an episode of acute pancreatitis. There is a homogeneous well-demarcated peripancreatic collection in the lesser sac, which abuts the stomach and the pancreas. The patient did not have fever. The collection underwent successful percutaneous drainage, which showed clear fluid with high amylase and subsequently resolved along with the patient's symptoms. Therefore, this collection proved to be a true pancreatic pseudocyst. A Pseudocyst is a collection of pancreatic juice or fluid enclosed by a complete wall of fibrous tissue It occurs in interstitial pancreatitis and the absence of necrotic tissue is imperative for its diagnosis. Communication with the pancreatic duct may be present. A pseudocyst requires 4 or more weeks to develop. The differential diagnosis includes walled-off necrosis and sometimes a pseudoaneurysm or even a cystic tumor. Most often, they occur in the lesser sac. Most collections that persist after 4 weeks are walled-of-necrosis. True pseudocysts are uncommon, since most acute peripancreatic fluid collections resolve within 4 weeks. Walled-off-necrosis
Walled-off Necrosis - WON:
Based on CT alone it is sometimes impossible to determine whether a collection contains fluid only or a mixture of fluid and necrotic tissue. Consequently it is sometimes better to describe these as 'indeterminate peripancreatic collections'. The images are of a patient with acute pancreatitis. On the upper image is a collection in the area of the pancreatic head in the right anterior pararenal space. At this stage, it is not possible to distinguish between an acute peripancreatic fluid collection and acute necrotic collection. On a follow-up scan the collection in the right anterior pararenal space increased in size. It has fluid density and a thin enhancing wall. This can be a pseudocyst or walled-off-necrosis and it may or may not be infected. The patient became septic and a percutaneous drainage was performed. After drainage the collection barely diminished in size. The patient underwent surgery and the collection was found to consist of necrotic debris, which was not appreciated on CT, hence this was a walled-off-necrosis and not a pseudocyst. The necrotic debris was too viscous for successful percutaneous drainage. Walled-off-necrosis (2) These CT-images are of a patient on day 40. This patient had central gland necrosis and now developed fever. The CT shows a similar collection of fluid density to that of the patient with the pseudocyst, except for its pancreatic location. The collection is homogeneous and well-demarcated with a thin wall abutting the stomach. During endoscopic debridement this collection contained fluid and necrotic tissue, which was removed from the area of the pancreas. Although the imaging characteristics in this case are similar to the patient with the pseudocyst, this proved to be infected walled-off-necrosis. Walled-off-necrosis (3) Here we see a homogeneous pancreatic and peripancreatic collection, well demarcated with an enhancing wall, on day 25 of an episode of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. This patient had fever and multiple organ failure. Therefore, this collection was suspected to be infected WON and not a pseudocyst. At surgery, the collection contained much necrotic debris, which was not depicted on CT. These cases illustrate that at times CT cannot reliably differentiate between collections that consist of fluid only and those that contain fluid and solid necrotic debris with or without infection.
Infected necrosis:
Infected necrosis is: This case is a typical example of infected pancreatic necrosis. The necrosis also involves the peripancreatic tissue. So this is an ANC - acute necrotic collection.
* On day 17 there are gas bubbles in the necrotic collection consistent with infected pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis. A wall surrounds the collection. The term pancreatic abcess is no longer used, since a collection of pus without necrotic tissue is extremely uncommon in acute pancreatitis. Infected necrosis (2) In this patient there is normal enhancement of the pancreas with surrounding septated heterogeneous acute necrotic collections with fluid- and fat densities. This is probably necrosis of the peripancreatic tissues. Two weeks later there are gas bubbles in the peripancreatic collection consistent with an infected acute necrotic collection. This patient underwent surgery. The surgeon removed a large amount of necrotic tissue and estimated he had removed over 90% of the pancreas. Continue with the next image. Remarkably, a CT performed 6 months after surgery showed a normal pancreas. This indicates that during surgery the differentiation between pancreatic necrosis and necrosis of the peripancreatic tissues is sometimes impossible. The limitations of imaging are summarized in the table. Central gland necrosis with large collections in the left retroperitoneum and lesser sac (ANC's)
Central gland necrosis:
Central gland necrosis is a specific form of necrotizing pancreatitis, representing full thickness necrosis between the pancreatic head and tail and is nearly always associated with disruption of the pancreatic duct. This leads to persistent collections as the viable pancreatic tail continues to secrete pancreatic juices. These collections mayreact poorly to endoscopic or percutaneous drainage. Definitive treatment may require distal pancreatectomy or long-term endoscopic drainage.
Reporting - PANCODE:
The Pancode system is a checklist for the description of acute pancreatitis and its complications.
Intervention:
The current management of acute pancreatitis is to be conservative for as long as possible. During the first two weeks patients with severe acute pancreatitis and multi-organ failure should be stabilized in the ICU. Interventions should be delayed for as long as possible. Many collections will remain sterile or resorb spontaneously. Allow for demarcation of collections, which takes about 4 weeks.
FNA and Drainage:
Once the clinical condition of the patient deteriorates and the patient is febrile, fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be used to differentiate between sterile and infected collections. Important remarks concerning FNA: Important remarks concerning Drainage: Peripancreatic collections can be approached through the transhepatic (red arrow), transgastric (green arrow) or transabdominal (blue arrows) route, but the preferred approach is to stay in the retroperitoneal compartment (yellow arrows). The retroperitoneal approach has some advantages: Videoscopic assisted retroperitoneal debridement (VARD)
Surgical intervention:
In 2013, the IAP/APA evidence-based guideline for the management for acute pancreatitis was published. The following recommendations were made: After removal of the necrotic tissue through videoscopic assisted retroperitoneal debridement, catheters are left in place
Take home messages:
In these cases MRI can be of additional value.

Meniscus special cases:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2010-04-13 In this article we will show some examples of special meniscal pathology in more detail. For the basics of meniscal pathology we advise you first to read the article 'Knee Meniscus - Part 1'. On most images you can click to get an enlarged view, but this does not work on the iPhone application.
Flipped meniscus:

Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images. Then continue reading.. As you already suspected by reading the title of this paragraph, this is a flipped meniscus. A flipped meniscus is a special form of bucket-handle tear. A flipped meniscus occurs when the ruptured fragment of the posterior horn is flipped anteriorly so the anterior horn of the meniscus appears to be enlarged. The anterior structure is the anterior horn. Also notice the focal bone marrow edema and the cartilage impression.
4. The anterior structure is the anterior horn.
5. Some irregularity of the posterior part.

Disable Scroll On the left another flipped meniscus. Now on the medial side. Part of the anterior horn is flipped posteriorly. Only a small part of the anterior horn is seen anteriorly. Most flipped menisci occur on the lateral side. The ACL prevents the meniscal fragment from completely migrating into the intercondylar notch. Illustration of the mechanism in a flipped meniscus. On a coronal image you will first see an enlarged bulky anterior horn. Posteriorly a very small posterior horn will be seen. See next case. Enable Scroll

3. Continue.
4. Here is the connection between the bucket handle and the posterior horn.
5. Here an anterior slice demonstrating a meniscal cyst.
6. Notice the horizontal high signal.
7. Here we can appreciate the complexity of the meniscal tear with a longitudinal and horizontal component (arrows). Bucket handle tears are displaced vertical longitudinal tears. The displaced inner fragment resembles the handle of a bucket. The remaining larger peripheral portion of the meniscus resembles the bucket. These tears account for about 10% of all meniscal tears.
Double PCL sign:
The double posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) sign is a low-signal-intensity band that is parallel and anteroinferior to the PCL on sagittal MR images. It is a highly specific indicator of a bucket-handle meniscal tear (3).
Meniscal root tear:
First study the image on the left and try to recognize the meniscal tear. These tears often go unnoticed. Then continue with the next images. Enable Scroll

LEFT: Absent or empty meniscus on sagittal image. RIGHT: Axial image shows complete radial tear leading to a defect in the meniscus. If you image a complete radial tear directly along the length of the tear you will see an absent or empty meniscus. These complete radial tears open up and give the impression that there is a part missing. However you will not find a displaced meniscal fragment. It is simply separation of the meniscal parts. On the left an illustration of a complete radial tear, which can result in an empty meniscus sign. Enable Scroll

On the left consecutive coronal PD-images of a posterior horn of a meniscus that at first glance might give the impression that it is normal. Continue with the sagittal images. When you take a good look at the sagittal images, you will notice the empty meniscus sign, where normally the meniscal root attaches (red arrows). This means that we are dealing with a meniscal root tear. The meniscus posteriorly should come up over the tibial spine to insert near the posterior cruciate ligament.

At first impression this looks like a tear within a discoid meniscus. At closer look you will notice that the horizontal structure has a lower signal intensity than the meniscus and looks funny. This is a normal variant caused by a vacuum phenomenon. A vacuum phenomenon is caused by negative pressure within the joint due to the position of the patient, which results in the accumulation of nitrogengas. Continue with the radiograph of the same patient. Vacuum phenomenon on the lateral side.

Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll First scroll through the images on the left. Try to figure out what is going on with this meniscus. Then continue reading. There is a longitudinal tear in the periphery of the meniscus (red arrow). The outside one-third of the meniscus is called the 'red' zone, because it has a rich blood supply. The location of a meniscal tear is of importance because tears in this vascular portion of the meniscus are more likely to heal spontaneously than tears in the avascular portion or white zone of the meniscus.
Meniscus within meniscus sign:
Sometimes extensive triangular or wedge-shaped high signal intensity can be encountered that does not reach te surface of the meniscus. This is sometimes referred to as meniscus within meniscus sign. Since this meniscal abnormality does not reach the meniscal surface, it does not fullfill the criteria for a meniscal tear. It was found that in half of these patients and symptoms warranting arthroscopic follow-up had meniscal tears (4). On the left another meniscus with diffuse high signal in the meniscal body. On other images (not shown) there was no evidence of a tear. Notice severe extrusion of the meniscus beyond the margin of the tibia plateau. Enable Scroll

Meniscal extrusion:
Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Tears involving the meniscal root (central attachment) are also significantly related to the severity of meniscal extrusion, seen in 3% with minor extrusion and 42% with major extrusion. With meniscus extrusion, the meniscus is unable to resist hoop stresses and cannot shield the adjacent articular cartilage from excessive axial load. Over time, this can lead to symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Tears of the posterior meniscal root can be easily missed because of inconsistent clinical symptoms and can be overlooked without thorough arthroscopic examination. Detection of meniscal extrusion is important not only because it is associated with underlying tear but also because meniscal extrusion itself is thought to be related to development of osteoarthritis.
Segond fracture and meniscal tear:
A Segond fracture is an avulsion of the lateral capsular ligament. The mechanism of injury is internal rotation and varus stress. On a radiograph it manifests as an elliptic bony fragment off the lateral proximal tibia (figure). A Segond fracture has a high association with a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (75-100%) and injuries of the medial and lateral menisci (66-70%). On the radiograph you could easily miss the Segond fracture (red arrow). Notice that there is also an avulsion of the medial collateral ligament. Continue with the MR-images. Enable Scroll

3. Besides the bucket handle tear (inner blue arrow), there is also a barely visible horizontal tear in the peripheral part of the meniscus (outer blue arrow). The horizontal tear was better appreciated on other images (not shown). Continue with the sagittal images.

In association with a Segond fracture (red arrow), there is also an avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament (blue arrow).
Meniscal cyst:
A meniscal cyst results from extrusion of synovial fluid through a peripherally extended horizontal meniscal tear. Medial meniscal cysts are most commonly located adjacent to the posterior horn and lateral meniscal cysts are most commonly located adjacent to the anterior horn or body. On the left a PD- and a T2-weighted image demonstrating a lateral meniscal cyst are adjacent to the anterior horn as a result of a complex tear. On the left three consecutive images of a small meniscal cyst (blue arrow) as a result of a horizontal tear (red arrow). On the left coronal PD-images without fatsat and with fatsat.

Publicationdate 2010-06-08 This is an update of the 2007 article, which used the Mountain-Dresler regional lymph node classification for lung cancer staging (MD-ATS maps)(1). In 2009 a new Lung cancer lymph node map was proposed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) in order to reconcile the differences between the Naruke and the MD-ATS maps and refine the definitions of the anatomic boundaries of each of the lymph node stations (2). In this article we provide illustrations and CT-images for a better understanding of this IASLC lymph node map.

Left Lower Paratracheal 4L nodes are lower paratracheal nodes that are located to the left of the left tracheal border, between a horizontal line drawn tangentially to the upper margin of the aortic arch and a line drawn tangentially to the upper margin of the left pulmonary artery. These include paratracheal nodes that are located medially to the ligamentum arteriosum. Station 5 (AP-window) nodes are located laterally to the ligamentum arteriosum. On the left an image just above the level of the pulmonary trunk demonstrating lower paratracheal nodes on the left and on the right. In addition there are also station 3 and 5 nodes. On the left an image at the level of the lower trachea just above the carina. To the left of the trachea 4L nodes. Notice that these 4L nodes are between the pulmonary trunk and the aorta, but are not located in the AP-window, because they lie medially to the ligamentum arteriosum. The node lateral to the pulmonary trunk is a station 5 node. 5. Subaortic nodes Subaortic or aorto-pulmonary window nodes are lateral to the ligamentum arteriosum or the aorta or left pulmonary artery and proximal to the first branch of the left pulmonary artery and
lie within the mediastinal pleural envelope. 6. Para-aortic nodes Para-aortic (ascending aorta or phrenic) nodes are located anteriorly and laterally to the ascending aorta and the aortic arch from the upper margin to the lower margin of the aortic arch. 7. Subcarinal nodes These nodes are located caudally to the carina of the trachea, but are not associated with the lower lobe bronchi or arteries within the lung.

On the corresponding CT image the node is not enlarged (blue arrow). The probability that this is a lymph node metastasis is extremely high since the specificity of PET in unenlarged nodes is higher than in enlarged nodes. 9. Pulmonary ligament nodes Pulmonary ligament nodes are lying within the pulmonary ligament, including those in the posterior wall and lower part of the inferior pulmonary vein. The pulmonary ligament is the inferior extension of the mediastinal pleural reflections that surround the hila. 10 Hilar nodes Hilar nodes are proximal lobar nodes, distal to the mediastinal pleural reflection and nodes adjacent to the intermediate bronchus on the right. Nodes in station 10 - 14 are all N1-nodes, since they are not located in the mediastinum.

Mediastinoscopy and EUS:

Conventional mediastinoscopy:
The following nodal stations can be biopsied by cervical mediastinoscopy: the left and right upper paratracheal nodes (station 2L and 2R), left and right lower paratracheal nodes (station 4L and 4R) and the subcarinal nodes (station 7). Station 1 nodes are located above the suprasternal notch and are not routinely accessed by cervical mediastinoscopy.
Extended mediastinoscopy:
Left upper lobe tumors may metastasize to the subaortic lymph nodes (station 5) and paraaortic nodes (station 6). These nodes can not be biopsied through routine cervical mediastinoscopy. Extended mediastinoscopy is an alternative for the anterior-second interspace mediastinotomy which is more commonly used for exploration of mediastinal nodal stations. This procedure is far less easy and therefore less routinely performed than conventional mediastinoscopy.
EUS-FNA:
Endoscopic Ultrasound with Fine Needle Aspiration can be performed of all the mediastinal nodes that that can be assessed from the oesophagus. In addition the left adrenal gland and the left liver lobe can be visualized. EUS particularly provides access to nodes in the lower mediastinum (station 7,8 and 9) by CF Mountain and CM Dresler Chest, Vol 111, 1718-1723

Radiology department of the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam and the Rijnland hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2011-01-01 In the article Bone Tumors - Differential diagnosis we discussed a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions. In this article we will discuss the differential diagnosis of ill-defined osteolytic bone tumors in alphabetic order. You can click on an item on the left.
Introduction:
On the left the most common ill-defined bone tumors and tumor-like lesions. An ill-defined zone of transition is seen in: On the left a table with the most common bone tumors and tumor-like lesions in different age-groups. In the middle column common ill-defined osteolytic lesions. Notice the following:
Chondrosarcoma:
Chondrosarcoma Key facts On the left a partially ill-defined osteolytic lesion with endosteal scalloping. There are cloud-like calcifications indicating a chondroid matrix. These imaging findings and the size of the lesion favor the diagnosis of a chondrosarcoma. On the left two other lesions that proved to be a chondrosarcoma. Notice that calcifications are not essential in chondrosarcoma. More on Chondrosarcoma On the left a lobulated partially ill-defined lytic lesion of the proximal humerus. The presence of calcifications suggest that this is a chondroid tumor. The lytic parts with cortical involvement and expansion should raise the suspicion of a high grade chondrosarcoma.
Eosinophilic granuloma:
Eosinophilic granuloma with ill-defined borders. Key facts On the left some examples of EG with ill-defined borders. There are single or multiple layered periosteal reactions. On the left a typical presentation of EG in the skull as an ill-defined osteolytic lesion. More on Eosinophilic granuloma
Ewing's sarcoma:
Ewing's sarcoma in diaphysis of the femur. Notice ill-defined zone of transition (blue arrow) and aggressive type of periosteal reaction (red arrows) Key facts On the left a patient with a Ewing's sarcoma in the femur. Notice the ill-defined osteolysis. There is an aggressive periosteal reaction. On the left an ill-defined lytic lesion in the femur of a young patient. There is a permeative destruction pattern with irregular cortical destruction. There is an aggressive periosteal reaction (arrow). This is also called sunburst appearance. On the left an ill-defined lytic lesion of the right iliac bone in a young patient which can easily be overlooked. Final diagnosis: Ewing's sarcoma. More on Ewing's sarcoma
Giant cell tumor:
GCT of the radius with ill-defined margins on the left and a GCT in the tibia with well-defined margins Key facts On the left a giant cell tumor of the distal radius with ill-defined margins, destruction of the subchondral bone plate and extension towards the soft tissues. On the right a giant cell tumor in the proximal tibia with somewhat better defined margin and non-interrupted cortical bone. More on Giant cell tumor
Lymphoma:
Key facts The plain radiograph on the left shows an ill-defined lytic lesion of the humerus diaphysis. Notice tunneling of the cortical bone (red arrows). On the MR notice the linear abnormalities within the cortical bone and the circumferential soft tissue mass. Differential diagnosis (depending on age): Ewing's sarcoma, osteomyelitis and bone lymphoma. Biopsy revealed Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Metastases:
Metastasis in distal femur Key facts On the left a 60 year old patient with a known malignancy. There is a lesion in the distal femur, that you could easily overlook and think that it was focal osteopenia. The lesion presents as a large ill-defined osteolytic mass extending into the epiphysis and almost abuttting the articular surface. In a patient 20-40 years of age GCT would be a possible diagnosis. It proved to be a metastasis.
Multiple Myeloma / Plasmacytoma:
Key facts
Osteomyelitis:
Key facts Periosteal reaction and permeative pattern may mimic malignant process: Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, lymphoma, leukemia.
* In the pediatric age group eosinophilic granuloma may also mimic osteomyelitis.
* Pediatric osteomyelitis: most commonly in central metaphysis, may cross to epiphysis.
* Adult osteomyelitis: most commonly in central metaphysis or diaphysis.
* May be highly permeative with cortical breakthrough, abcesses and fluid along fascia on MR imaging. On the left a subacute form of osteomyelitis. There is an eccentric ill-defined lesion seen on both sides of the physeal plate in the proximal tibia. This is highly suggestive for osteomyelitis. Other lesions do not cross the growth plate in general. On the right coronal T1-weighted MR image reveals a well-defined epi-metaphyseal lesion. There is a dark peripheral zone of reactive sclerosis, and extensive edema with low signal Intensity in the metaphysis. On the left an ill-defined osteolytic lesion in the proximal metaphysis of the tibia with extensive reactive sclerosis and solid periosteal reaction.
Osteosarcoma:
Osteosarcoma Key facts of Osteosarcoma On the left a mixed osteolytic and sclerotic lesion in the proximal humerus with irregular cortical destruction. There is an aggressive periosteal reaction and a soft tissue mass.
Roadmap to evaluate ovarian cysts.:
Wouter Veldhuis, Robin Smithuis, Oguz Akin and Hedvig Hricak
Department of Radiology of the University Medical Center of Utrecht, of the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands and the Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA:
Publicationdate 2011-05-15 Ovarian cancer is the second most common of all gynecologic malignancies. It is the leading cause of death in this category of diseases, frequently presenting as a complex cystic mass. The finding of an adnexal cyst causes considerable anxiety in women due to the fear of malignancy. However, the vast majority of adnexal cysts - even in postmenopausal women - are benign. In this article we will focus on specific features of ovarian cysts that are helpful in making a differential diagnosis. We will present a roadmap for the diagnostic work-up and management of ovarian cystic masses, based on ultrasound and MRI findings. In Ovarian Cystic Masses II the imaging features of normal ovaries and the most common ovarian cystic masses will be presented, as well as several less common cystic lesions.
Diagnostic work-up:
If a cystic pelvic mass is present, the first step is to find out if it is ovarian or non-ovarian in origin.
* Step 2 The next step is to determine if the lesion can be categorized as one of the common, benign ovarian masses (simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or mature cystic teratoma), or is indeterminate.
* Step 3 To aid in selecting the proper work-up, the final step is to determine whether a patient falls into a low-risk category (i.e. premenopausal women without additional risk factors) or a high-risk category (i.e. post-menopausal or premenopausal with additional risk factors). Based on these steps we can determine further management: ignore, follow-up with US, further evaluation with MRI or excision.
Role of imaging:
Role of Ultrasound For characterization of ovarian masses, ultrasound is often the first-line method of choice, especially for distinguishing cystic from complex cystic-solid and solid lesions. Role of CT CT is useful for the N- and M-staging of proven malignant lesions. Role of MRI For complex lesions, primary evaluation with ultrasound is often followed by further evaluation with MRI. Even with MRI it is often not possible to make an accurate diagnosis of neoplastic subtype. By using MRI as an adjunct to sonography a delay in the treatment of potentially malignant ovarian lesions is prevented. This is not only beneficial to the small number of women who do have ovarian cancer, but also a proven cost-effective approach to the management of sonographically indeterminate adnexal lesions.
Ovarian or non-ovarian:
If a cystic adnexal mass is present and you suspect an ovarian origin, the first thing to do is try to identify the ovaries. If the gonadal vessels lead to the lesion with no separately identifiable normal ovaries, then most likely you are dealing with an ovarian lesion. If both ovaries are separately identifiable from the lesion, you are dealing with a non-ovarian cystic lesion, or a lesion that mimics a cystic mass. The next step would be to check if there is uni- or bilateral disease and to look for any solid components that may indicate malignancy. Also look for secondary findings like ascites, enlarged lymph nodes and peritoneal deposits. The table shows a differential diagnosis for possible cystic ovarian masses. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images A helpful tool to identify the ovaries is to follow the ovarian veins caudally. Scroll through the CT-images and follow the right ovarian vein from where it joins the inferior vena cava, and the left ovarian vein where it joins the left renal vein, until you identify the ovaries.
Ultrasound pattern recognition:
Pattern recognition on ultrasound often allows a fairly confident diagnosis of common cystic ovarian masses. This means that in many cases the diagnostic work-up is based on determining the probability that we are dealing with a lesion which falls into the category of a simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or a mature cystic teratoma (commonly referred to as a dermoid cyst). Most other cystic lesions are indeterminate and therefore possibly malignant. These therefore require further evaluation, either with MRI or surgical excision.
Simple cyst:
US findings that allow a confident diagnosis of a simple ovarian cyst are: The US-image shows two simple cysts in the right ovary with ovarian stroma in between. The surrounding vessels are normal and there are no vascularized septations. These were simple follicular cysts in a premenopausal woman. Differential diagnosis Most simple cysts are functional cysts, usually follicular cysts. 
They are commonly seen in premenopausal women, but functional cysts also still do occur in postmenopausal women. Some simple cysts may turn out to be paraovarian or paratubal cysts. A hydrosalpinx may also mimic an ovarian cyst. Cystadenomas can also present as simple cysts, but they usually present as a large cyst in a postmenopausal woman. In a large cancer screening study from 1987 to 2002 including 15,106 women of 50 years or older, 2763 women (18%) were diagnosed with a unilocular ovarian cyst. None of these isolated unilocular cysts turned out to be ovarian cancer (4). In women of reproductive age, cysts up to 3 cm are a normal physiologic finding. 
These simple physiologic cysts do not need to be described in the imaging report and do not require follow-up (1). Cysts up to 7 cm in both pre- and postmenopausal woman are almost certainly benign. Cysts larger than 7 cm may be difficult to assess completely with US and therefore further imaging with MR or surgical evaluation should be considered. Normal ovaries Functional cysts Hemorrhagic cyst
Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst - HOC:
When a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. US findings that allow a confident diagnosis of a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst are: In premenopausal women short term follow-up is recommended in hemorrhagic cysts > 5 cm. The same follow-up is recommended in early postmenopausal women who have a cyst with all the characteristics of a HOC
Larger hemorrhagic cysts in the early menopause and any hemorrhagic cyst in the late menopause should be considered possibly neoplastic and MRI or surgical evaluation should be considered. Hemorrhagic cyst with a clot mimicking a neoplasm. Notice absence of flow and good through-transmission (arrow) Differential diagnosis When hemorrhagic cysts present with diffuse low-level echoes, their appearance can be similar to that of endometriomas. In the acute phase a hemorrhagic cyst may be completely filled with low-level echoes, simulating a solid mass (5). Clot in a hemorrhagic cyst may occasionally mimic a solid nodule in a neoplasm. Clot, however, often has concave borders due to retraction, while a true mural nodule has outwardly convex borders. In both cases there will be no internal flow at Doppler US and there will be good through-transmission. Hemorrhagic cysts typically resolve within 8 weeks. The ultrasound image shows multiple simple and one complex right ovarian cyst, with diffuse low-level echos and absence of flow on Doppler US. Note that there is good through-transmission, also through the complex cyst (blue arrow). On the T1 with fatsat the lesion remains bright, ruling out a fatty lesion. After Gd administration there is no enhancement, confirming that this is a cystic hemorrhagic lesion, most likely a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, although your differential may include an endometrioma. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst
Endometrioma:
US findings that allow a confident diagnosis of an endometrioma are: In women of any age, probable endometriomas require initial 6-12 week follow-up to rule out a hemorrhagic cyst. Until surgically removed, endometriomas require follow-up with ultrasound, for example on a yearly basis. This image from a vaginal ultrasound shows a large hypoechoic, cystic lesion with diffuse low-level echoes and two small echogenic foci. These have been postulated to be cholesterol deposits, but may also constitute small blood clots or debris. It is important to differentiate these echogenic foci from true wall nodules. Finding these echogenic foci makes the diagnosis of an endometrioma very likely. Endometrioma
Mature cystic teratoma:
US findings that are characteristic of a mature cystic teratoma are: Shown are transvaginal ultrasound images of two patients that demonstrate the 'tip-of-the-iceberg' sign: acoustic shadowing from the hyperechoic part of the dermoid cyst (arrow). When misinterpreted as bowel gas, the lesion may be overlooked. Mature cystic teratoma
Any other cyst - possible neoplasm:
All other cystic lesions are regarded as possibly neoplastic and therefore possibly malignant. Surgical resection is needed by an oncologic gynaecologist, who may request prior imaging-based staging. Findings indicating possible neoplasm: While benign lesions can be very large, the likelihood that a lesion is neoplastic increases with size. Also the likelihood that a neoplastic lesion is malignant, increases with the size of the lesion.
* Vascularized septations The presence of septations indicates a possible neoplasm. When septations have a thickness of more than 3mm and are well-vascularized - while non-specific - both increase the likelihood that a neoplasm is malignant.
* Vascularized solid components Vascularized nodularities, papillary projections, or frank solid masses all increase the likelihood of a neoplastic nature.
* Vascularized thick, irregular wall Lesions with thin walls are more often benign and lesions with thick, irregular walls are more often malignant. However, there is some overlap, making wall thickness a less useful criterion. For example a corpus luteum cyst may also have a thickened, vascularized wall.
* Secondary findings associated with malignant lesions: Large quantities of ascites, lymphadenopathy and peritoneal deposits are strongly associated with an increased likelihood of malignancy. Benign cystic ovarian neoplasms Malignant cystic ovarian neoplasms
Low-risk or High-risk:
Once we have determined a cystic ovarian lesion is either a probable simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma or mature cystic teratoma, or is indeterminate, the next step is to place the patient in a low-risk or high-risk group (table). The final decision to ignore, follow or excise a cystic ovarian lesion is based on: That said, the great majority of cystic ovarian lesions is benign. While the risk of malignancy does increase with age, even in post-menopausal women the risk of malignancy in a simple ovarian cyst
Although complex ovarian cysts in post-menopausal women are also most often benign, they do require further work-up, because of the chance of malignancy.
'the Roadmap':
The natural history of incidentally detected pelvic masses with benign US morpgology is not known and therefore the optimal management is also unknown. The roadmap is based on the 2010 Consensus Guidelines published in (1) and (2) and on the findings in (3) and (4). The mentioned size cut-offs and follow-up frequencies are accepted practices but not ironclad rules. Local guidelines may differ based on the clinical scenario and institutional practice preferences. Many of the imaging criteria described in this article are the same for ultrasound, CT and MRI, although of course not every feature is equally detectable on all modalities. Risk factors Age is the most important risk factor for all women. Lesions in pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women are managed differently. Several other factors (see table) may place a woman in a higher risk category. Concordantly, the roadmap shows two pathways, one for lower-risk and one for higher-risk patients.
MRI protocol - which sequences, and why:
MRI protocol There are many possible 'Pelvic/Ovarian mass' protocols. The basic building blocks are simple and are the same for all protocols: A very short protocol may consist of only 1, 2 and 3 (e.g., when the request is to 'rule out an ovarian mass'). Many radiologists prefer a slightly more comprehensive protocol including 4, and often 5. When the clinical setting is characterization or staging of a known ovarian lesion, 4 (or CT) and 5 should always be included. The role of diffusion-weighted MRI is yet to be determined, but DWI is a useful aid in the detection of lymph nodes, tumors and peritoneal deposits. 
For the purpose of detection, the DW images are sometimes fused with (superimposed on) anatomical T2W images. 
DWI cannot discriminate benign from metastatic lymph nodes. Further differences in protocols all arise as variations on this simple theme. For example:
* T2W images in more than 2 planes, or obliquely angled orthogonal to the anatomic structure of interest, are often useful for cervical or uterine-body pathology.:
MR imaging is a valuable adjunct to US, as it allows identification of blood products within hemorrhagic masses that may mimic solid tumor at US. Fat-suppressed T1-weighted MR images may reveal small amounts of fat, which allows the diagnosis of a mature teratoma ('dermoid'). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging depicts features of malignancy such as enhancing mural nodules and/or enhancing solid areas with or without necrosis (3). These MR images show a lesion with high signal on T1. This indicates either blood, other high protein content or fat. On the image with fat-saturation there is suppression of the signal. This means that we are dealing with a fat-containig lesion, i.e. a mature cystic teratoma. The US image shows an echogenic lesion. The corresponding lesion has a high signal on the T1-weighted MR image.
This indicates either blood, high protein or fat. On the image with fat-saturation there is no suppression of the signal. This means that we are dealing with a blood-containig lesion, i.e. most likely a hemorrhagic cyst. by Deborah Levine et al September 2010 Radiology, 256, 943-954.

Practical approach to Acute Abdomen:
Adriaan van Breda Vriesman and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2005-10-20 The 'acute abdomen' is a clinical condition characterized by severe abdominal pain, requiring the clinician to make an urgent therapeutic decision. This may be challenging, because the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen includes a wide spectrum of disorders, ranging from life-threatening diseases to benign self-limiting conditions (Table 1). Indicated management may vary from emergency surgery to reassurance of the patient and misdiagnosis may easily result in delayed necessary treatment or unnecessary surgery. Sonography and CT enable an accurate and rapid triage of patients with an acute abdomen. We present practical guidelines on the radiological approach of these patients. Interactive cases are presented in the menubar to test your knowledge.
Radiological strategy:
Table 1. Common causes of acute abdomen from life-threatening to self-limiting. Before you perform an examination, obtain relevant information from the referring clinician. Don't let the clinician simply 'order' a sonogram or CT, but discuss the patient's age and posture, laboratory results and the number one clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Based on that information and your own degree of confidence with the modalities decide for yourself whether to perform sonography or CT. Sonography has the advantage of close patient contact, enabling assesment of the spot of maximum tenderness and the severity of illness without ionizing radiation. In general the diagnostic accuracy of CT is higher than sonography. In patients with inconclusive US-results, CT can serve as an adjunct to sonography, and vice versa. We advocate the following two-step radiological approach of an acute abdomen. Confirm or exclude the most common disease Screen for general signs of pathology You have to be familiar with all the diagnoses listed in Table 1 to be able to recognize them.
Clinics, laboratory, and plain abdominal film:
The clinical presentation of patients with an acute abdomen is often nonspecific. Both surgical and nonsurgical diseases may present with a similar clinical history and symptoms. Laboratory findings (leucocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP) are equally nonconclusive. Findings may be normal in patients who need emergency surgery (such as appendicitis) and may be abnormal in patients without a surgical disease (like salpingitis). A plain abdominal film has a limited value in the evaluation of abdominal pain. A normal film does not exclude an ileus or other pathology and may falsely reassure the clinician. LEFT: Plain abdominal film in a patient with an acute abdomen, showing no abnormalities. RIGHT: Subsequent CT shows distended small bowel loops (arrowheads) that are not seen on plain abdominal film because they are filled with fluid only and do not contain intraluminal air. An ileus may not be appreciated on a plain abdominal film if bowel loops are filled with fluid only without intraluminal air (figure). Alternatively if a plain abdominal film does indicate an ileus than sonography or CT are usually needed to identify its cause. Thus, a plain abdominal film is seldomly useful, with the exception of detection of kidney stones or a pneumoperitoneum. For all other indications use sonography or CT.
Confirm or exclude the most common disease:
Many disorders may cause an acute abdomen, but fortunately only a few of these are common and clinically important. Focus on confirming or excluding these frequent disorders:
RLQ : Appendicitis:
Pain in the RLQ, regardless of any other symptom or laboratory results, should be considered to be appendicitis until proven otherwise. If you are unable to find the appendix you cannot rule out the diagnosis of appendicitis unless a good alternative diagnosis is found. If you do not find the appendix and there is no altermative diagnosis call the results of the examination indeterminate. Do not call it:' no appendicitis'. Normal appendix : Longitudinal (A) sonogram depicts a blind-ending tubular structure (arrowheads) with 'gut-signature', with a maximum outer diameter of 6 mm, with noninflamed surrounding fat. On an axial view (B) the appendix can be compressed crossing the iliac vessels. Normal Appendix. Your first task is to identify the appendix. At sonography and CT the appendix is seen as a blind-ending nonperistaltic tubular structure arising from the base of the cecum. Do not mistake a small bowel loop for the appendix. Secondly determine if the appendix is normal or inflamed. The outer-to-outer diameter of the appendix is the most important imaging criterium. Although an overlap of appendiceal diameters in normal and inflamed appendices can incidentally be found, a threshold value of 6-7 mm is generally used. Normal appendix: CT shows an air-containing non-distended appendix (arrowheads), with homogeneous low-density periappendiceal fat. A normal appendix has a maximum diameter of 6 mm, is surrounded by homogeneous non-inflamed fat, is compressible and often contains intraluminal gas. Inflamed appendix at sonography. Longitudinal (A) and transverse (B) cross-section show a distended noncompressible appendix, surrounded bij hyperechoic inflamed fat (arrowheads). Inflamed Appendix An inflamed appendix has a diameter larger than 6 mm, and is usually surrounded by inflamed fat. The presence of a fecolith or hypervascularity on power Doppler strongly supports inflammation. Inflamed appendix at CT. The appendix (arrows) is fluid-filled and distended with periappendiceal fat-stranding. CT depicts an inflamed appendix as a fluid-filled blind-ending tubular structure surrounded by fat-stranding. In the case on the left a hyper-attenuating wall is seen on the enhanced CT. In patients who lack intra-abdominal fat the use of iv. contrast can be helpfull in depicting the inflamed appendix. Sigmoid diverticulitis at sonography. A hypoechoic thickened diverticulum is surrounded by hyperechoic inflamed fat (arrows).
LLQ : Diverticulitis:
If the pain is located in the LLQ your main concern is sigmoid diverticulitis. In diverticulitis sonography and CT show diverticulosis with segmental colonic wall thickening and inflammatory changes in the
fat surrounding a diverticulum. Uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis. Fat stranding and focal thickening of the colonic wall in an area with diverticula. No abscess formation. Complications of diverticulitis such as abscess formation or perforation, can best be excluded with CT. LEFT: Sigmoid diverticulitis. Diverticulum (arrow) is surrounded by hyperattenuating fat. The sigmoid wall is thickened. RIGHT: Sigmoid carcinoma with limited fat stranding. An important pitfall is colon cancer, which may present with similar imaging features, especially when the colon cancer is surrounded by fat stranding due to invasive groth, desmoplastic reaction or inflammation. Frequently it is not possible to reliably distinguish diverticulitis from colon cancer and therefore we routinely include colon cancer in the differential diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis.
RUQ : Cholecystitis:
Cholecystitis occurs when a calculus obstructs the cystic duct. The trapped bile causes inflammation of the gallbladder wall. As gallstones are often occult on CT, sonography is the preferred imaging method for the evaluation of cholecystitis, also allowing assesment of the compressiblity of the gallbladder. The diagnosis of a hydropic galbladder is solely made on the non-compressability of the galbladder. Do not rely on measurements. Some galbladders happen to be small and others are large. Longitudinal and transverse US show thickened gallbladder wall. The gallbladder is noncompressible ('hydropic') and causes an impression in the anterior abdominal wall (arrowheads). The imaging appearance of cholecystis consists of an enlarged hydropic (meaning non-compressible) gallbladder with a thickened wall in the region of maximum tenderness (the so-called 'Murphy sign') Cholecystitis at CT. The gallbladder is enlarged with edematous thickening of its wall (arrowhead), and some regional fat-stranding can be found. The inflamed gallbladder usually contains stones or sludge, whereas the obstructing calculus itself may or may not be identified because it is located deep within the galbladder neck or cystic duct. The gallbladder may be surrounded by inflamed fat, but on sonography this frequently is not seen, while CT sometimes does show fat-stranding. Potential pitfalls are pancreatitis, hepatitis or right-sided heart failure, which all may lead to thickening of the gallbladder wall without cholecystitis. Therefore be certain that hydropic obstruction of the gallbladder is present before assigning the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Pain in LUQ An acute abdomen with LUQ pain is rare. Its most common cause is gastric pathology in which radiological imaging plays a minor role.
Screen for general signs of pathology:
After excluding these frequent disorders, search for signs of any other pathology, by systematically screening the whole abdomen. Look for inflamed fat, bowel wall thickening, ileus, ascites and free air. Inflamed fat at sonography. Extended-view of the ventral abdomen depicting an area of hyperechoic noncompressible inflamed fat in the omentum (red arrows). Compare this to the echogenicity of normal abdominal or subcutaneous fat (green arrows). This patient had an omental infarction.
Inflamed fat:
Inflamed fat is hyperechoic, space occupying and noncompressible at sonography. Same patient as above. Unenhanced CT depicts an area of fatty tissue with slightly increased density (arrowheads), in the right-upper quadrant. Compare this to normal low-density subcutaneous fat. Diagnosis: omental infarction. Inflamed fat is shown as fat-stranding at CT. Inflamed fat usefully points out where and what the problem is. As a rule, the organ or structure in the centre or nearest to the inflamed fat is the cause of the inflammation. ![Diffuse thickening of bowel wall in a patient with colitis.](/assets/acute-abdomen-practical-approach/a5097976c20727_US-darmwandverdikking-(coli.jpg) Diffuse thickening of bowel wall in a patient with colitis.
Bowel wall thickening:
Thickening of bowel wall indicates inflammation or tumor, and has an extensive differential diagnosis. Thickening of small bowel loops usually indicates regional inflammation, as small bowel tumors (carcinoid, lymphoma, GIST) are relatively infrequent. In patients with local colonic wall thickening a carcinoma is a prime concern. Obstructive ileus. CT depicts distended small bowel loops, but part of the small bowel and the whole colon is nondistended. Therefore this must be an obstructive small bowel ileus, and in this case its cause can easily be identified: intussusception (arrowhead).
Ileus:
Pathologic distention of bowel loops may be caused by obstruction or paralysis. Firstly determine which parts of the gut are affected: small bowel, large bowel, or both. Look for normal nondistended bowel loops, which, if present, strongly suggest an obstructive cause for the ileus. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll through the imagesSmall Bowel Feces Sign: Feces in the dilated small bowel just proximal to the site of obstruction. Obstruction was due to adhesions Small bowel obstruction (SBO) accounts for approximately 4% of all patients presenting with an acute abdomen. The diagnosis of SBO is made when you see dilated small bowel and collapsed small bowel loops. If obstruction is present, try to identify its cause and location (adhesion, tumor, volvulus, intussusception, inguinal hernia). Adhesions account for 60-80% of all cases and are the likely cause when a smooth transition from dilated to collapsed small-bowel loops is noted. The 'Small Bowel Feces Sign' (SBFS) is a very useful sign as it is seen at the zone of transition thus facilitating identification of the cause of the obstruction. The SBFS has been defined as gas and particulate material within a dilated small-bowel loop that simulates the appearance of feces. Scroll through the images on the left to see the small bowel feces sign indicating the site of obstruction. Alternatively, an ileus without any normal bowel loops strongly suggests a paralytic cause. This is usually a response to general peritonitis, wich may have many possible causes of the inflammation. Clinically appendicitis. US only showed a little bit of ascites. A diagnostic puncture (arrow marks needletip) revealed blood. In a woman this finding is very suspicious of an EUG.
Ascites:
Asymptomatic volunteers do not have a detectable amount of free intraperitoneal fluid, with the exception of an incidental drop of fluid in Douglas in fertile women. The presence of ascites is a nonspecific sign of abdominal pathology, indicating that 'something is wrong'. You may want to perform a US-guided diagnostic puncture of the ascites, in order to investigate whether it is sterile reactive fluid, pus, blood, urine, or bile. Intraperitoneal air in a patient suspected of having appendicitis. Air better seen on images with lungsetting on the right.
Free air:
The presence of free intraperitoneal air is proof of bowel perforation, and indicates a surgical emergency. A pneumoperitoneum has only two frequent causes: Perforation of a gastric ulcer Perforation of colonic diverticulitis Free air is usually not seen in perforated appendicitis). Always examine the images in lungsetting for better detection of free intraabdominal air (figure).
Differential diagnosis:
A complete list of all possible causes of an acute abdomen is of little use in daily practice, therefore we just provide some imaging examples of several frequent causes of acute abdominal pain US shows enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant, with no other abnormalities
Mesenteric lymphadenitis.:
Mesenteric lymphadenitis is a common mimicker of appendicitis. It is the second most common cause of right lower quadrant pain after appendicitis. It is defined as a benign self-limiting inflammation of right-sided mesenteric lymph nodes without an identifiable underlying inflammatory process, occurring more often in children than in adults.. This diagnosis can only be made confidently when a normal appendix is found, because adenopathy also frequently occurs with appendicitis.
Key finding: Lymphadenopathy with a normal appendix and normal mesenteric fat. Normal appendix (green arrow) and enlarged mesenteric lymphnodes (yellow arrows). On the left a CT of mesenteric lymphadenitis in a child suspected of appendicitis. US typically shows submucosal wall thickening (arrowheads) of the terminal ileum and cecum without inflammation of the surrounding fat.
Bacterial ileocecitis:
Infectious enterocolitis may cause mild symptoms resembling a common viral gastroenteritis, but it may also clinically present with features indistinguishable from appendicitis especially in bacterial ileocecitis, caused by Yersinia, Campylobacter, or Salmonella. Key finding: ileocecal wall thickening without inflamed fat, adenopathy, normal appendix CT shows an inflamed cecal diverticulum (arrowhead) with regional colonic wall thickening.
Right-sided diverticulitis:
Right-sided colonic diverticulitis may clinically mimic appendicitis or cholecystitis, though the patient's history is generally more protracted. In contrast to sigmoid diverticula, right-sided colonic diverticula are usually true diverticula, that is, outpouchings of the colonic wall containing all layers of the wall. This may possibly explain the essentially benign self- limiting character of right-sided diverticulitis. Enlarged adnex due to salpingitis
Pelvic inflammatory disease:
Pelvic inflammatory disease is a common mimicker of both of appendicitis and diverticulitis. Transvaginal sonography depicts an inhomogeneous enlarged inflamed ovary. CT characteristic of epiploic appendagitis with a right-sided fatty mass surrounded by a hyperattenuating ring.
Epiploic appendagitis.:
Epiploic appendages are small adipose protrusions from the serosal surface of the colon. An epiploic appendage may undergo torsion and secondary inflammation causing focal abdominal pain that simulates appendicitis when located in the right lower quadrant or diverticulitis when located in the left lower quadrant. The characteristic ring-sign corresponds to inflamed visceral peritoneal lining surrounding an infarcted fatty epiploic appendage. Left sided epiploic appendagitis in patient clinically suspected of having a diverticulitis.Characteristic hyperattenuating ring sign. Epiploic appendagitis has been reported in approximately 1% of patients clinically suspected of having appendicitis. It is very important to make a positive diagnosis of this characteristic entity since epiploic appendagitis is a self-limiting disease. Both US and CT will depict an inflamed fatty mass adjacent to the colon. Key finding: inflamed fatty mass adjacent to the colon with characteristic ring sign. Small stone in right ureter (arrow) causing right flank pain.
Urolithiasis:
Urolithiasis often causes flank pain, but an ureteral stone (arrowhead) may occasionally present with clinical signs simulating appendicitis, cholecystitis or diverticulitis. Appendicitis on the other hand may cause hematuria, pyuria and albuminuria in up to 25% of patients because of ureteral inflammation from an adjacent inflamed appendix. Left retroperitoneal fluid collection due to ruptured aneurysm.
Ruptured Aneurysm:
Most abdominal aortic aneurysms rupture into the left retroperitoneum (4). Clinically this may simulate sigmoid diverticulitis or renal colic due to impingement of the hematoma on adjacent structures. However most patient will present with the classic triad of hypotension, a pulsating mass and
back pain. Continuous leakage will lead to rupture into the peritoneal cavity and eventually death. Sonography is a quick and convenient modality, but it is much less sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of aneurysmal rupture than CT. The absence of sonographic evidence of rupture does not rule out this entity if clinical suspicion is high. Pancreas surrounded by fat stranding due to exsudative pancreatitis.
Pancreatitis:
CT depicts fat-stranding (arrowheads) surrounding the primary focus of the inflammation: the pancreas. Conclusion In patients with an acute abdomen 'the stakes are high'. A misdiagnosis may have serious consequences. We advocate a systematic approach: First focus on the most common diseases and make a firm diagnosis or exclude them. Always screen the whole abdomen for general signs of pathology. A prospective study of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of appendicitis JB Puylaert et al; NEJM Volume 317:666-669

Dynamic Rectal examination:
Tjeerd Wiersma
Radiology department of the Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, The Netherlands.:
Publicationdate 2006-07-15 Dynamic rectal examination (DRE) is also known as defecography or proctography. DRE provides a dynamic assessment of the act of defecation by recording the rectal expulsion of a barium paste that approximates the consistency of feces. DRE provides qualitative and quantitative information on the function of anorectal and pelvic floor function, and the effectiveness of the anal sphincter and rectal evacuation. by Tjeerd Wiersma
Dynamic Rectal Examination:
The commode needs to be radiolucent and safely attached to a fluoroscopic table
Indications:
Indications for dynamic rectal examination are: LEFT: Pathology is suspected because of a great distance between rectum and vagina. No oral contrast had been given. RIGHT: After ingestion of liquid barium contrast a large enterocele is seen.
Technique:
Two hours prior to the examination the patient ingests 135 ml of liquid barium contrast to opacify the small bowel (figure). Rectal contrast can be administered without rectal preparation.
The ideal rectal contrast has to simulate stool in weight and consistency.
In our experience, Evacu-Paste? 100 (E-Z-EM Inc., Westbury, NY, USA) is a convenient paste. The barium paste is injected until the patient experiences discomfort due to rectal distension or until about 250 ml has been instilled. In females the vagina is coated with 30 ml amidotrizoic acid 50% solution gel.
It is applied by means of a syringe with a soft pediatric enema tip. The use of tampons and gauzes soaked in barium should be avoided, because they can impaire pelvic-function. After sufficient filling of the rectum, the patient is asked to sit on a special commode.
The fluoroscopic screening of the rectum and the function of the pelvic musculature and the continence mechanism is assessed.
The duration of examination is about 15 minutes.
Imaging:
Rest, start of defecation and end of defecation Examinations includes a number of standard images and maneuvers. Initially the patient is screened in lateral projection at rest without consciously contracting any pelvic muscles and a spot film is taken. The patient then maximally contracts the pelvic floor muscles ('squeeze') which results in a more tense muscular diaphragm and in elevation of the entire pelvic floor a spot film or video is taken. Finally the patient is asked to empty the rectum as completely as possible.
An estimate of the completeness of defecation and measurement of pelvic floor descent can be made. Morphological abnormalities are usually discernible during this part of procedure. During straining a S-shaped rectum may simulate intussusception in lateral projection. It is important that the patient is sitting during the procedure, since much of physiological nature of defecation is lost when the patient is lying down. Additional oblique or anteroposterior (AP) views should be taken of any unexplained radiographic feature seen on the lateral views (figure). An S-shaped rectum may simulate an intussusception in lateral projection. On the left lateral and an AP-view of a patient with an intussuseption on both views. On the left lateral and an AP-view of a patient with an S-shaped rectum which simulates an intussuseption on the lateral view.
Recording:
The whole procedure of DRE should be recorded on video or DVD. Dynamic recording of the fluoroscopic images enables the examiner to follow the movements of the rectum, facilitating the diagnosis of rectocele, enterocele and intussusception, as well as to evaluate the function of the anal sphincter. Digitization of fluoroscopic image or digital substraction may facilitate direct screen measurements of angles. Some patients give a history of various unusual maneuvers (digital support of vagina or perineum) to aid defecation. Allowing the patients to demonstrate the maneuvers during the examination may facilitate the radiological documentation of the mode of action. Since a number of treatment methods, which successfully can restore the dynamics of rectal evacuation, have been developed speed and completeness of rectal emptying is clinically important and therefore need to be recorded.
Normal findings:
At rest (left), during defecation (middle) and at the end of defecation (right) At rest: distance between vagina and ventral rectal wall
Findings of abnormalities:

Rectocele:
A rectocele can be defined as an anterior or posterior bulge of the rectal wall
beyond the extrapolated line of the wall (Fig. 1). The formation of an anterior rectocele is often apparent during defecation and may reflect
relative weakness of the rectovaginal septum.
At the end of the defecation, residual rectal contents may be left in the rectocele ('trapping').
Significantly more anterior rectoceles were found in female patients and in female control subjects than in males.
Anterior rectoceles may occur in individuals without complaints of the anorectal region
and should therefore particularly in women be considered as a posiible normal phenomenon. Rectocele seen during straining (right) The main symptoms associated with a rectocele are usually a feeling of incomplete bowel movement
often requiring digital pressure to the vagina or perineum to facilitate emptying, together with aching
after a bowel movement. Barium trapping in the rectocele is considered to be important in explaining the repeated
sensation of rectal fullness after defecation. In our own series no correlation could be found between the size of the rectocele and the symptoms, so we do not grade rectoceles anymore. It has been suggested that rectoceles may be the result of repeated straining secondary
to a preexisting disorder (f.e. spastic pelvic floor syndrome) of defecation rather than to
the rectocele being the primary cause of the obstructive symptoms. This may also explain why rectocele repair is often unsuccessful in relieving symptoms.
When surgical repair of a rectocele detected at physical examination is considered, preoperative
DRE should be performed to exclude other causes of obstructed defecation (intussusception or enterocele). DRE demonstration of a rectal intussusception may change the operative procedure e.g. to
correct the intussusception instead of the rectocele. In patients with an anterior rectocele, in whom other causes of obstructed defecation are ruled out, surgical rectocele repair should be considered. In our opinion there are two indications for operating on an anterior rectocele. First: if a patient needs vaginal digital support to facilitate defecation. Second: in cases of disturbed sexual intercourse. Posterior rectoceles are incidental findings and not related to clinical symptoms (figure). 1 : Intra-rectal intussusception, 2 : Intra-anal intussusception, 3 : Extra-anal intussusception (rectal prolapse)
Intussusception:
Intussusception of the rectum is an invagination of the rectal wall, which begins as a circular fold 6 to 8 cm up in the rectum and develops into a condition in which the entire rectal wall folds in towards the rectal lumen. The intussusception can be intra-rectal, intra-anal or finally extra-anal as a rectal prolapse (figure). In connection with straining this folding inwards progresses and deepens to form a ring pocket, so that it finally fills the entire ampulla. This may reach down to, into or through the anal canal (rectal prolapse). A minimal folding inwards which disappears after the bolus has passed is probably caused by a transient prolapse of the rectal wall and should not be considered pathological. The most common complaint of the patient with intussusception is: Difficulty in bowel emptying. Pain, blood loss upon defecation Incontinence of gas and/or feces Mucus discharge which often leads to pruritis ani. Upon hard straining the obstructive sensation increases.
In order to empty their bowels many patients have to extract the feces manually, while others have to exert pressure with their hands about the anus and perineum.
Enemas may be ineffective. S-shaped rectum which simulates an intussuseption on the lateral view (same case as above). Rectal prolapse (extra-anal intussusception) may be transient and difficult to reproduce, while intrarectal intussusception may be overlooked on clinical examination and is seldom revealed by proctoscopy. When the intussusception reaches into the anal canal it leads to maximal dilatation. These patients often complain of fecal incontinence in between defecation while they have the feeling of an obstacle or incomplete emptying during defecation. A longstanding intussusception may lead to the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. There is seldom doubt regarding the clinical diagnosis of complete rectal prolapse. Lesser grades of prolapse, however, can present a variety of difficulties. Oblique or anteroposterior (AP) views can be necessary too, due to the AP view provides a more reliable image of intra-anal intussusception than the standard lateral view during evacuation.
Enterocele:
An enterocele is a peritoneal sac that has herniated downwards along the ventral rectal wall. As DRE is routinely performed with small bowel and vaginal contrast, loops of small bowel are then seen to fill the gap between the vagina and the rectum. Grade 1 is maximally reaching down to the distal half of the vagina, and partial or complete reduction of the rectal lumen. Grade 2 is as grade 1, but reaching down to the perineum. Grade 3 is protruding out of the anal canal to form a rectal prolapse. Normal findings at rest (left); during defecation there is a rectocele, that is pushed downward by an enterocele . Sometimes the enterocele is identified only at the end of the defecation, after repeated straining. An enterocele may be pressed into the direction of the introitus vaginae. If there is an associated rectocele, this can be pushed downward by the enterocele and finally evacuated (figure). Clinically it can be difficult to diagnose an enterocele. Patients with previous pelvic surgery are predisposed to the formation of an enterocele. A sigmoidocele is seen between vagina and rectum. In female patients with constipation there is a higher incidence of severe enteroceles in patients with a hysterectomy (22%) compared to the group without hysterectomy (9%). Chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure may cause an enterocele with or without a previous pelvic operation. A sigmoidocele is a prolapse of redundant sigmoid colon into a deep pouch of Douglas.
It is less common than an enterocele. Schematic lateral view on the levator ani and external sphincter ani muscles
Spastic pelvic floor syndrome:
On the left a schematic lateral view on the levator ani and external sphincter ani muscles is shown. The puborectal muscle should be contracted at rest (sharp anorectal angle). During defecation the puborectal muscle should relax allowing passage of the stool. LEFT: Hypertonic sphincter (during defecation).RIGHT: Impression of hypertonic puborectal muscle (non-relaxing during defecation). Spastic pelvic floor syndrome denotes a persistent contraction of the pelvic floor muscles during defaecation. It represents a functional disorder of the pelvic floor muscles causing an outlet obstruction. The question arises, however, whether persistent contraction is due to the conscious action of an embarrassed patient, thus only occurring during the investigation, or whether it really represents a functional disorder of the pelvic floor muscle resulting in outlet obstruction. The etiology is unknown.
Psychological factors may play a role. The anorectal angle (ARA) normally increases on straining as a result of relaxation of the puborectal muscle. The extent of increase may range from 20? to 40?. In a small group of patients with impaired evacuation, DRE demonstrated either an unchanged or decreased ARA on straining or defecation, which findings frequently result from a persistent or paradoxical increase of the puborectal muscle impression. This appearance is often quite persistent and the evacuation may only be achieved after multiple attempts at straining and defecation.

Publicationdate 2007-04-24 Multi-slice CT is increasingly replacing ultrasonography for the evaluation of patients with acute abdominal pain.
Ultrasound however has specific advantages. This review will focus on: For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com
Introduction:
Illustration of a sigmoid diverticulitis
Why perform ultrasonography when you have CT ?:
Multi-slice CT is increasingly replacing ultrasonography (US) for the evaluation of patients with acute abdominal pain CT has major advantages over US: it is extremely fast and its time burden is often less than that of a US examination (1-4). CT is not disturbed by gas and bone, while obesity is even an advantage. Most of all, CT is not operator-dependent and can be reviewed by others, even at a distance. With all these advantages, it is not surprising that US is losing field in the evaluation of the acute abdomen. US however has some advantages. Visualization of the normal appendix by CT in an obese patient and by US in a lean patient.
Specific advantages of US:
This is only true if the target organ can be approached closely, which requires either a thin patient or the use of graded compression. Realtime US allows to observe the effects of Valsalva manoeuvre. Intra-abdominal fat is pressed into the abdominal wall (arrow) through an epigastric hernia. Specific advantages of US (2) US can directly visualize blood flow and pulsations, and it is also possible to appreciate the effects of respiration, Valsalva maneuver, gravity and compression. Realtime US allows to observe the effect of compression. Compare the contracted normal ileum (left) with the relaxed, flattened ileum in the same patient a few seconds later (right) The latter is especially useful to judge whether organs or tissues are soft or rigid. Real time US allows one to observe the effect of compression. On the far left a contracted normal ileum and next to it a relaxed flattened ileum a few seconds later. US guided puncture of intraperitoneal fluid reveals purulent nature of the fluid in a patient with perforated appendicitis. Specific advantages of US (3) The advantage of US over CT is that it allows precise correlation of the US findings with the area of maximum tenderness or with a palpable mass with. Another advantage of US is its mobility and flexibility: It can be done in the Emergency Ward, High Care Units and the Operating Room, and with the present generation of small, battery-assisted, hand-held units, in fact anywhere. Information provided by the patient may lead to a specific search for a US finding, while, vice versa, certain US findings may lead to a specific question to the patient. This interactive aspect is perhaps the greatest secret of a successful US examination. If performed in this way, US is much more than depicting abdominal organs. As the examination proceeds, it is possible to correlate the US findings with the clinical data, the laboratory results, other imaging studies and the information provided by the patient. Doing so, the long list of possible differential diagnoses will continuously narrow down until a definitive diagnosis is established, or at least, direction is given to subsequent imaging studies. The point of maximum tenderness and a possible palpable mass, are correlated with the US findings and in case of free fluid, US guided puncture can be done (Figure).
Who does the US examination ?:
Worldwide, there is a large variation of who performs the US examination of the acute abdomen. US is done by technicians, general radiologists, radiologists specialized in US, abdominal radiologists, and all sorts of clinicians, urologists, gynecologists and even family doctors. The US examination performed as described above, requires a person with a thorough medical background, knowledge of all possible causative conditions (urological, gynecological, gastrointestinal, vascular, etc.), and with a large expertise in US as well as in CT, imaging guided puncture and other radiological imaging. There is no doubt that the person who meets these conditions best is the radiologist, and preferably a radiologist with special interest in abdominal US and CT. Additional advantages of concentrating all primary, diagnostic abdominal US examinations within the Radiology Department are obvious: It guarantees integrated imaging, constant quality, round-the-clock coverage, continuity, central archiving and accurate and early triage of patients with abdominal symptoms (6).
US Technique:
Normal ileum and appendix during compression. Thin habitus of the patient and the application of compression allow the use of a 13.5 MHz transducer with a high image quality. US examination in patients with acute abdominal pain requires a specific technique of graded compression. In this way fat and bowel are displaced or compressed. This eliminates the disturbing influence of bowel gas and reduces the distance from the transducer to the appendix, allowing the use of a high frequency probe with better image quality (Figure). This technique also allows assessing the rigidity of a structure by evaluating its reaction upon compression In order to avoid pain, the compression should be applied slowly and gently, similar to the classic palpation of the abdomen. Acutely inflamed appendix in deep pelvic position. The appendix could only be visualized with the help of a transvaginal probe. The entire abdomen is examined to exclude disease of gallbladder, pancreas, kidney, aorta, stomach, small and large bowel, appendix, uterus and ovaries. A moderately filled bladder allows better survey of the distal ureters, and of uterus and ovaries in women; however, a full bladder does not allow proper graded compression. Transvaginal US may be used for gynecological conditions but also for pelvic appendicitis, diverticulitis and Douglas abscesses. The 'mowing-the-lawn' technique. The peritoneal cavity is screened for bowel pathology with five to six vertically oriented, overlapping lanes using a broad based, high frequency probe. We refer to this as 'mowing the lawn' (Figure). This form of screening is facilitated by the use of thin-liquid US-gel. Segmental colitis in Crohn's disease Bowel pathology is usually conspicuous, because the diseased and empty bowel has a thickened and hypoechoic wall, which contrasts with the surrounding hyperechoic fatty tissue. On the left a patient with segmental colitis caused by Crohn's disease. The pathologic bowel segment is easily picked up using the 'mowing-the-lawn' technique.
Appendicitis:
The typical appearance of an inflamed appendix is that of a concentrically layered, non-compressible sausage-like structure demonstrated in a fixed position at the site of maximum tenderness (Figure). The average maximum diameter is 9 mms with a variation from 7 to 17 mms. In 30% intraluminal fecoliths are found actually obstructing the lumen. Six to 12 hours after the onset of symptoms, the inflammation progresses to the adjacent fat of the meso-appendix, which becomes larger, more hyperechoic and less compressible. Later on, this fatty tissue will tend to increase in volume around the appendix: this represents mesentery and omentum, which have migrated towards the appendix in an attempt to wall-off the imminent perforation. Acute appendicitis. The inflamed appendix shows local disturbance of the layerstructure indicating local transmural progression of the infection. The surrounding inflamed fat will probably effectively wall-off the imminent perforation. Slowly applied intermittent compression is the best way to identify the non-compressible inflamed fat (Figure). An irregular, asymmetrical contour and loss of the layer structure of the appendix indicate perforation or imminent perforation. Vascularization of the appendiceal wall is either markedly increased or absent due to high intraluminal pressure with concomitant ischemic necrosis, however there is always increased vascularization in the directly surrounding fatty tissue . The presence of a generalized, adynamic ileus is suspect for perforated appendicitis, even if the inflamed appendix cannot be visualized. Inflamed appendix in unusual high position in a patient with clinical signs of cholecystitis. Due to its abnormal position far from McBurney's point (McB), the appendix was drawn on the skin with a waterproof pencil. This influenced site, size and orientation of the incision and facilitated the appendectomy. A small quantity of free intraperitoneal fluid is aspecific. It may be present in both non-perforated and perforated appendicitis as well as in many other conditions, both surgical and non-surgical. A large quantity of fluid in the presence of an inflamed appendix may represent pus from perforated appendicitis and then is usually accompanied by paralytic ileus. Larger quantities of free fluid are also found in perforated peptic ulcer (note air and food particles) and gynecological conditions (puncture usually reveals blood). In most patients with appendicitis inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes can be demonstrated higher up in the mesenterial root. In case of an abnormal position of the inflamed appendix far from where the usual gridiron-incision is made, it is useful to indicate the location of the appendix on the skin of the patient with a waterproof marker. This may influence site, size and orientation of the incision. Spontaneous resolving appendicitis. LEFT: inflamed appendix with a dilated lumen and a diameter of 11mm. Patient experienced rapidly subsiding symptoms and did not undergo operation.RIGHT: Two days later the patient was symptom free. The appendix has decreased in size.
Normal appendix:
The normal appendix presents as a small, easily compressible, concentrically layered, mobile, blind-ending, sausage-like structure. A diameter up to 7mm is regarded as normal. The normal appendix is mobile, may have a collapsed lumen, but also may contain air or some fecal material, and rarely a little fluid (6). Power Doppler reveals scarce or no vascular signal and there is no hyperechoic, non-compressible inflamed fat around the appendix. Acute appendicitis. Noncompressible, inflamed appendix (arrowheads) lies next to the normal well-compressable ileum. The lumen is dilated and the diameter is 11 by 13 mm. Note the fluid-debris level within the lumen.
Spontaneous resolving appendicitis:
If the clinical symptoms rapidly subside despite the presence of an unequivocally inflamed appendix on US, one should consider the diagnosis of spontaneously resolving appendicitis. These patients initially have the typical clinical signs of appendicitis, but within 12-48 hours after the onset of pain the clinical symptoms relatively abruptly subside, probably due to relief of obstruction. On US follow up, the appendix usually decreases in size in the course of days. If the patient recalls similar previous attacks, immediate appendectomy is advisable, even if the patient is again completely free of symptoms at that time. Histology in such cases will nevertheless- confirm acute inflammation. In case conservative management is opted for, keep in mind that there is a recurrence rate of approximately 40 % (8). Resolution of an appendiceal phlegmon: At presentation, eight days later and finally another six weeks later.
Appendiceal mass:
Patients, who are admitted with considerable delay may present with a palpable mass and relatively mild peritonitis. In these patients, who usually have a high ESR, US shows a large mass of non-compressible fat around the appendix, interspersed with echolucent streaks . These patients are diagnosed as 'appendiceal phlegmon' and are usually managed conservatively because the surgeon knows that appendectomy in such cases is technically difficult or even impossible (9). On the left a 35-year old man with a 10-day history of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. At examination a palpable mass was found. There was no evidence of peritonitis. On the top image the US reveales a large noncompressable inflammatory mass consisting of the inflamed appendix, mesentery and omentum. Patient was treated conservatively. Follow up examination at 8 days and another 6 weeks later showed still some residual abnormalities. The patient was completely symptom free. There were no recurrent symptoms and the patient did not undergo operation. Appendiceal abscess containing fecolith next to inflamed appendix (arrows). If next to the inflamed appendix, a fluidcollection is found, this is suggestive for an appendiceal abscess. The collection often contains air and is surrounded by inflamed non-compressible hyperechoic tissue representing omentum and mesentery as well as secondarily thickened neighboring bowel loops, attempting to seal-off the abscess from the peritoneal cavity. If an appendiceal abscess is demonstrated and there is no frank peritonitis, percutaneous drainage is the treatment of choice. In stable patients who have no fever and only mild pain, it can be even wise to await spontaneous drainage of the abscess to neighboring bowel. On the left an abscess cavity that contains a fecolith. Note the inflamed appendix (arrows) lying next to the abscess. Acute appendicitis with a small periappendiceal abscess.
Better off with immediate surgery:
Finally, there are some patients with an appendiceal abscess who are better off with immediate surgery: this goes in general for children and for those patients with severe peritonitis, which indicates that the walling-off process is failing. Immediate surgery is also indicated for patients who have a small abscess with a history of only a few days of symptoms, in whom appendectomy with evacuation of the abscess is usually technically easy (Figure). On the left a patient with a 4-day history of right lower quadrant pain. There was peritonitis at physical examination. The sedimentation rate was 48mm/hour. Palpation was unreliable. Subsequent appendectomy with evacuation of the abscess was performed without technical difficulties. Prior to percutaneous drainage, CT is necessary to delineate the extent of the abscess and to determine the safest access route. If expertise is available in US guided puncture, the combination US plus fluoroscopy has several advantages over CT guided drainage. It is rapid, allows continuous control, any angulation, and can be performed as a bed-side procedure.
Pitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis:
A false positive diagnosis can be made if the normal appendix is mistaken for an inflamed one. Not infrequently the normal appendix is larger than 7 mms, especially in children due to lymphoid hyperplasia and in adults due to fecal impaction. Appendiceal compressibility, the absence of a Doppler signal and the absence of inflamed fat are the most important features in deciding if it is normal or inflamed. Mistaking a normal appendix for an inflamed one may also occur if there is secondary thickening of the appendix associated with cecal carcinoma. In the latter case, the appendiceal lumen is obstructed giving rise to sterile accumulation of mucus in the lumen.
The patient often has remarkably mild symptoms and is managed conservatively under the erroneous diagnosis of an appendiceal phlegmon. If the underlying tumour is small and is not recognized, this may lead to considerable delay in surgical treatment. The combination of a relatively large appendix with paradoxically mild and atypical symptoms should raise suspicion of underlying malignancy. Other conditions with secondary thickening of the appendix are perforated peptic ulcer, Crohn's disease and sigmoid diverticulitis. Pitfall. The inflamed appendix, demonstrated in the longitudinal (left) and axial (right) plane, has a gas-filled lumen (arrowheads), making it difficult to identify.The sausage shape and the inflamed fat are the clue to the diagnosis. Pitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis (2) A false negative ultrasound examination is mostly the result of overlooking the inflamed appendix. In experienced hands the inflamed appendix can be visualized in 90% of patients with acute appendicitis. Generalized peritonitis hampers graded compression which may account for a lower score in patients with free appendiceal perforation. Also air-filled dilated bowel loops from adynamic ileus may hide the appendix from view. Air in the lumen can make it difficult to identify the inflamed appendix. Pitfall. Acute appendicitis, but appendix has a diameter of only 6.5mm. However there is inflamed fat and an increased Doppler signal indicating that it is acutely inflamed. Pitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis (3) Another pitfall is demonstration of the normal proximal part of the appendix while the distal inflamed tip is overlooked, because it is obscured by bowelgas. Rarely, the inflamed appendix has a maximal diameter of less than 7 mms. In those cases rigidity, hypervascularity and the presence of inflamed fat must give the clue. On thr left a patient with acute pain in the right lower quadrant. The appendix has a diameter of only 6.5mm. However there is inflamed fat and an increased Doppler signal indicating that it is acutely inflamed. Pitfall. Secondary thickening of the ileum by appendicitis. If the prominent ileum is appreciated, but the inflamed appendix (arrow) is overlooked, an erroneus diagnosis of Crohn's disease or infectious ileocolitis can be made. Pitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis (4) Another pitfall is advanced appendicitis where there is secondary wall thickening of the ileum. Often the ileal thickening is more prominent and conspicuous on US than the underlying inflamed appendix (Figure). If only the ileum is appreciated and the appendix is overlooked, an erroneous diagnosis of infectious
ileocecitis or Crohn's disease can be made, leading to ill-advised surgical delay. Similarly, if in an adult patient enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are the sole US finding, one should be cautious to diagnose mesenteric lymphadenitis because these nodes could be secondarily enlarged due to acute
appendicitis, while the inflamed appendix is overlooked. If in a patient with appendicitis only the fecolith in the appendiceal base is visualized and the rest of the appendix is overlooked, this may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis. Pitfalls in the US diagnosis of appendicitis (5) Also, if in a woman a relatively large rightsided ovarian cyst is found, this is not necessarily the cause of her symptoms and appendicitis should still be searched for. Finally, if in advanced appendicitis only the hyperechoic non-compressible inflamed fat of omentum and mesentery is visualized, and the inflamed appendix is overlooked, this may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of omental infarction or epiploic appendagitis (10,11). In patients with equivocal US findings, CT scan is indicated. A fortunate circumstance is that these are often obese patients.
Ileocecal Crohns disease:
Crohn's ileitis with transmural inflammation and abscess formation. Patients with ileocecal Crohn's disease often have protracted and atypical symptoms causing marked diagnostic delay. On the other hand, Crohn's disease may also present with acute, appendicitis-like symptoms and lead to an ill-advized operation. In both scenarios US may play an important role in establishing the initial diagnosis (12,13). The sensitivity of US for detecting ileocecal Crohn's disease of over 95%. On the left a patient with Crohn's ileitis. US reveals marked wall thickening of the terminal ileum with focal disruption of the wall and a small abscess, walled of by hypoechoic, inflamed fat. Crohn's ileitis with fistula (arrow) to the adjacent appendix. Note the focal loss of layer structure of the ileal wall and large masses of surrounding inflamed fat (fat). Sonographically, there is marked mural thickening of the ileum, which shows decreased or no peristalsis and is not compressible. Classically, all layers are involved and layerstructure is often locally disturbed , the earliest sign being echolucent changes in the submucosa. There is inflammation of the fatty mesentery and omentum, recognizable as hyperechoic, non-compressible tissue adjacent to the ileum. In the echolucent wall bright eccentric foci may indicate deep ulceration. Echolucent streaks within the hyperechoic tissue indicate liponecrotic tracts, which may herald fistulaformation (Figure). Cecum and appendix may also show mural thickening. Mesenteric lymph nodes are often markedly enlarged, but hypovascular. In longstanding Crohn's disease, 'creeping fat' is found which is recognized as a large, moderately well-compressible fatty mass encompassing most of the circumference of the ileum and iso-echoic to normal fat. Eventually, there are often US signs of prestenotic dilatation, abscess formation, or fistulaformation.
Infectious ileocolitis and Infectious ileocecitis:
Infectious ileocolitis is a bacterial infection of terminal ileum and colon which is characterized by diarrhea and abdominal pain. The most frequently cultured bacteria are Campylobacter and Salmonella, and Yersinia. The infection is generally limited to the mucosa, is self-limiting and rarely poses diagnostic problems. There is an interesting variant of infectious ileocolitis in which the infection is mainly limited to the ileocecal area and is therefore has been coined infectious ileocecitis (14). It is usually caused by the same bacteria and the importance of this variant is that its clinial symptoms are dominated by acute right lower abdominal pain, while diarrhea is absent or only mild. These symptoms masquerade as the clinical signs of appendicitis and explain why infectious ileocecitis often leads to an unnecessary laparotomy. Infectious ileocecitis in a patient with clinical symptoms of appendicitis. There is marked mucosal and submucosal wall thickening of ileum and cecum. The symptoms of Yersinia are often more protracted and then both the clinical symptoms and the US features may mimick those of Crohn's disease. The absence of a transmural component, the self-limiting course and of course positive stool cultures or serology will yield the correct diagnosis. The frequency of infectious ileocecitis is fairly high and has a ratio of 1 to 8 compared to appendicitis (14). On the left a 26-year old woman with clinical symptoms of appendicitis.
US shows prominent ileocecal valve and to marked mucosal and submucosal wallthickening of ileum and cecum.
Enlarged lymph nodes were found in the radix of the mesentery. The appendix was normal. Appendectomy was cancelled. The next day the patient developed diarrhea and stool cultures eventually revealed Campylobacter jejuni. Infectious ileocecitis. US reveals mucosal and submucosal wall thickening. The ascending colon is contracted with prominent haustration. The appendix is normal (arrow). In infectious ileocecitis US shows fairly characteristic features. There is diffuse thickening of mucosa and submucosa of the terminal ileum and the cecum. The appendix has to be sonographically normal (Figure). Infectious ileocecitis caused by Yersinia, Campylobacter, and Salmonella. In contrast to ileocecal Crohn's disease, in infectious ileocecitis, the wall layers are always intact and the muscularis and serosa, are never affected. Also omentum and mesentery are never involved and there are never signs of bowel obstruction, abscess- or fistula-formation. The various micro-organisms have a slightly different pattern of affecting the ileocecal area (Figure). On the left a schematic representation of relative involvement of ileum, cecum and mesenteric nodes in infectious ileocolitis caused by Yersinia, Campylobacter, and .
Mesenteric Lymphadenitis:
Mesenteric lymphadenitis. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Appendix was normal. This is an ill-defined entity, probably of viral origin, in which the mesenteric lymph nodes become inflamed and enlarged. It is a typical disease of childhood and is only rarely seen in young adults. It mimicks the clinical signs of appendicitis and may therefore lead to an unnecessary appen?dectomy. The US findings are solely enlarged, hypervascular mesenteric lymph nodes. However if these are the only US findings in a symptomatic young adult, it is well possible that these nodes are in fact secondarily enlarged due to acute appendicitis and the inflamed appendix is overlooked.
Cecal carcinoma:
Cecal carcinoma. US reveals asymmetric, hypoechoic, circumferential wall thickening of the cecum (arrowheads) with narrowing of the lumen. There is one pathologically enlarged lymph node. Patients with cecal carcinoma can present with acute or subacute abdominal symptoms, in several ways. The tumour may cause acute small bowel obstruction, the appendix may be involved, the tumour may perforate and the tumour itself may cause direct pain. The often bulky nature of the tumour and the close proximity of the right colon to the abdominal wall makes cecal carcinoma in most cases fairly conspicuous on US. The majority presents as a hypoechoic, solid, well-vascularized irregular and asymmetrical thickening of the cecal wall (Figure). In the proximity enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes can be found, and in most cases there is also some inflamed fat around the tumour. In a minority of cases the tumour is of the scirrhous type, which is less easy to detect. The finding of livermetastases of course strongly supports the diagnosis of malignancy. Ingrowth of the tumour in the appendiceal base only rarely causes a full-blown appendicitis, but rather will lead to mucinous dilatation of the appendiceal lumen. On US the enlarged appendix is often more conspicuous than the underlying tumour and, since there is often a palpable mass and protracted symptoms, these patients are often misdiagnosed as to have an appendiceal phlegmon, leading to significant surgical delay. A clue to the correct diagnosis is the discrepancy between the relatively mild and protracted symptoms of intermittent, nagging pain and the impressive size of the appendix and the surrounding tissue. Another helpful sign are markedly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (short axial diameter > 12 mms). If CT is not helpful and both clinical symptoms and US abnormalities do not resolve within weeks, colonoscopy is indicated.
Sigmoid diverticulitis:
Normal, empty sigmoid. Axial view during relaxation and compression with the transducer shows the colonic anatomy the best. Note the three teniae coli, visible as a focal thickening of the muscularis layer. Note the separation of each tenia from the circular muscular layer by a thin, echogenic layer of connective tissue (arrowheads). The diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis is often made on clinical grounds. In the classical case the patient presents with localized pain and guarding in the left lower abdomen, fever, leukocytosis and, later on, elevation of the sedimentation rate. However, the diagnosis is not always clear. On one hand the clinical signs may be so atypical that initially another diagnosis is considered, as urinary tract infection, renal colic, perforated peptic ulcer, adnexitis or, -in case of diverticulitis in a rightsided loop of sigmoid- appendicitis. On the other hand, the clinician may think of sigmoid diverticulitis while in fact another condition is present, as sigmoid carcinoma, epiploic appendagitis, a gynecological or urological condition or even a ruptured aortic aneurysm. In all of these cases, US may play a role by making the correct diagnosis at an early point in time. On US, the normal descending colon and upper part of the sigmoid can reliably be identified in virtually all patients due to its consistent location laterally in the left paracolic gutter. The US appearance of the normal sigmoid is variable. The lumen can be empty or filled with feces, and the sigmoid can be contracted or relaxed (Figure). Sigmoid diverticulosis in two asymptomatic patients. The fecalith-filled diverticula are recognized as strongly reflective, round structures casting an acoustic shadow and localized at the outer contour of the empty sigmoid. The thin wall of the diverticulum, consisting of mucosa only, is not separately visible. A third factor influencing the aspect is compression by the transducer, which flattens the colon. The muscularis in diverticulosis is often markedly thickened and fecolith-containing diverticula can easily be recognized, as large (4-12 mms), strongly reflective, round-ovoid structures casting an acoustic shadow and localized on the outside of the contour of the contracted colon. If the sigmoid is filled with feces, the diverticula are hardly recognizable. On the left sigmoid diverticulosis in two asymptomatic patients. LEFT: The neck of the diverticulum becomes obstructed. Surrounding inflamed fat represents mesentery and omentum attempting to wall-off the imminent perforation. RIGHT: Development of a small paracolic abscess, successfully walled-off by mesentery and omentum. The US appearance of diverticulitis depends on the stage of the disease. In the earliest stage there is usually local wall thickening of the colon, at first without but later with local blurring of the layer structure. Around the fecolith there is hyperechoic, non-compressible tissue, which represents the inflamed mesentery and omentum trying to seal off the imminent perforation. This inflamed fat, which is best identified during gentle, intermittent compression with the transducer, is obligatory for the diagnosis of diverticulitis (15). On the left a schematic presentation of the benign, natural course of sigmoid diverticulitis as it is observed in 80 % of patients. In stage 0 the neck of the diverticulum becomes obstructed, followed by high intra-diverticular pressure and an impaired defense system against the bacteria lodging within the fecolith. Surrounding inflamed fat represents mesentery and omentum attempting to wall-off the imminent perforation. In stage 1 there is development of a small paracolic abscess, successfully walled-off by mesentery and omentum. The fecolith usually disintegrates and the sigmoid wall is locally weakened. LEFT: Evacuation of pus and residual fecal material through the weakened sigmoid wall into the colonic lumen. RIGHT: Residual abnormalities remain fairly long after resolution of the symptoms. In over 80 % of patients, after one or two days, the pus and the fecolith evacuate towards the colonic lumen via local weakening of the colonic wall at the level of the original diverticular neck. (Figure) . Correspondingly, the patient's symptoms resolve. Note that the residual inflammatory changes (stage R) may remain present for a long time after the evacuation, so the patient can be completely symptomfree when there are still considerable US visible abnormalities present. Sigmoid diverticulitis: Natural, benign course. On the left the natural, benign course of sigmoid diverticulitis. TOP: US reveals mural thickening of the sigmoid at the level of an inflamed diverticulum (arrow) containing a fecolith (stage 0). Note the surrounding hyperechoic, non-compressible tissue representing the omentum and mesentery effectively walling-off the imminent perforation. Within the fat, echolucent linear streaks (arrowheads) are visible. MIDDLE: One day later the patient feels slightly better. The fecolith cannot be recognized as such and the contents of the diverticulum are bulging towards the sigmoid lumen, sign of impending evacuation. BOTTOM: Another two days later, the patient was almost symptomfree. Pus and fecal material have completely evacuated to the sigmoid lumen, leaving an empty diverticulum (curved arrow). Paracolic abscess due to diverticulitis (transvaginal US) In about 20 % of patients, diverticulitis takes a complicated course. Free perforation without any sealing-off by mesentery or omentum, is relatively rare. Spill of fecal material and/or pus to the peritoneal cavity quickly leads to severe peritonitis rendering laparotomy inevitable. Even in case of a larger diverticular abscess (> 2.5 cms) spontaneous evacuation to the colonic lumen remains the rule (Figure). On the left a paracolic abscess due to diverticulitis, effectively walled-off by large masses of inflamed fat, representing mesentery and omentum. The abscess eventually evacuated completely, and the patient recovered without surgery. Schematic presentation of the natural evolution of sigmoid diverticulitis, once a paracolic abscess has developed. In some patients however the abscess may evacuate in a less favourable direction (Figure). In the first place, it may find its way to neighbouring diverticula, thus giving rise to more longitudinally oriented abscesses undermining the colonic wall. These abscesses tend to heal badly and often lead to recurrent inflammation with stenosis eventually requiring elective surgery. In rare cases the abscess breaks through to the peritoneal cavity which may lead to diffuse peritonitis or to secondary abscessformation. If a diverticular abscess evacuates into bladder or vagina, a fistula may result. On the left a schematic presentation of the natural evolution of sigmoid diverticulitis, once a paracolic abscess has developed. The most frequent and most favourable pathway is evacuation to the sigmoid lumen. Less favourable is breakthrough to neighboring diverticula (D), giving rise to persistent, longitudinal, cuff-like abscesses. Even worse is the formation of secondary abscesses (A), and eventual perforation to the peritoneal cavity (P). Finally, evacuation to bladder (B), vagina (V) and through the skin will lead to fistulaformation.

Differential diagnosis of diverticulitis:
Finally, US has an important role in the diagnosis of alternative conditions: ureterolithiasis, sigmoid carcinoma, ruptured aortic aneurysm, perforated peptic ulcer, appendicitis, epiploic appendagitis.

The patient's symptoms disappeared within a week without treatment.br> Although in lean patients and in women using the transvaginal probe, differentiation of diverticulitis from colonic carcinoma is often well-possible, it is good practice that in every patient with diverticulitis, colonoscopy is performed when the inflammatory changes have subsided. Percutaneous drainage of a large diverticular abscess is indicated in case of persistent spiking fever, however it is only rarely needed. The presence of a persistent, large paracolic abscess should always raise the suspicion of underlying malignancy.
Right sided colonic diverticulitis:
Rightsided colonic diverticulitis in many respects differs from sigmoid diverticulitis. Diverticula of the right colon are usually congenital, solitary, true diverticula containing all bowel layers. The fecoliths within these diverticula are larger, the diverticular neck is wider and there is no hypertrophy of the muscularis of the right colonic wall. Understandably, right colonic diverticulitis, which can occur at any age, almost invariably has a favourable course and never leads to free perforation with peritonitis or large abscesses. Although relatively rare, it is crucial to make a correct diagnosis, since the clinical symptoms of acute RLQ pain may lead to an unnecessary operation for suspected appendicitis. In 40% of patients it even leads to a right hemicolectomy because the surgeon during the operation assumes he is dealing with a colonic malignancy. Although much more frequent in Asians, the diagnosis in the Western world is not rare: in a recent study one case of right colonic diverticulitis is seen for every 15 cases of sigmoid diverticulitis, and for every 30 cases of appendicitis [Oudenhoven]. US, if necessary complemented by CT, has characteristic features and prevents unnecessary surgery for this benign and self-limiting condition. For proper understan?ding of the US images, it is vital to realize the dynamic sequence of the inflammatory process, where each stage of the disease has its own US image [Oudenhoven]. A dangerous pitfall is to mistake a fecolith in the base of an inflamed appendix for a case of cecal diverticu?li?tis.

The inflamed fat represents mesenterial and omental fat (fat) attempting -in vain- to wall off the perforation. RIGHT: In the right lower quadrant a large amount of debris-like peritoneal fluid is found. The finding of pneumoperitoneum on a standing chest X-ray in combination with severe acute upper abdominal pain, is strongly suggestive for perforated peptic ulcer. A laparotomy will usually follow without additional imaging. In some cases however, symptoms of a perforated ulcer may be atypical and mimic those of appendicitis, in which case no chest X-ray is made. In other cases of perforated ulcer free air is not present or not detectable. In all those cases, US and CT may be of help. Free air is easier detected by CT than by US, but US better defines the ulcer, demonstrates the free fluid, and can guide puncture of this fluid. On the left a patient with a perforated duodenal ulcer. In the right upper quadrant wall thickening of the duodenal bulb is seen. There are both transmural and extramural (arrow) gasconfigurations. The inflamed fat represents mesenterial and omental fat (fat) attempting -in vain- to wall off the perforation.
In the right lower quadrant a large amount of debris-like peritoneal fluid is found (right image). US in the left decubitus position demonstrates free air. (Continued) On the left another image of the patient with the perforated duodenal ulcer.
In the left decubitus position free air can be seen to collect between liver and the lateral abdominal wall. In peptic ulcer US visualizes asymmetrical thickening of the duodenal wall which contains a constant air configuration reaching from the duodenal lumen to the periphery of the wall or even penetrating into the adjacent inflamed fat. Right decubitus position will allow gastric fluid- which is usually present in peptic ulcer disease- to proceed to the duodenum, enabling a better visualization of the ulcer. In case of perforation, an air-track can be found from the ulcer to the peritoneal cavity usually in ventral or cranial direction. Free air is best demonstrated in the left decubitus position between liver and right abdominal wall. A lot of free fluid is usually present which contains airbubbles and foodparticles. Puncture reveals turbid or purulent fluid Radiology 205 :43-45.

Dementia - Role of MRI:

Alzheimer Centre and Image Analysis Centre, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam and the Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp, The Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2012-01-09 / Update: 2022-03-03 This presentation will focus on the role of MRI in the diagnosis of dementia and related diseases. We will discuss the following subjects: Short overview of neurodegenerative disorders which may be associated with dementia Introduction.
Introduction.:
Coronal image of the hippocampus. The role of neuroimaging in dementia nowadays extends beyond its traditional role of excluding neurosurgical lesions. Radiological findings may support the diagnosis of specific neurodegenerative disorders and sometimes radiological findings are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. It is a challenge for neuroimaging to contribute to the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis includes recognition of pre-dementia conditions, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition, early diagnosis allows early treatment using currently available therapies or new therapies in the future. Neuroimaging may also be used to assess disease progression and is adopted in current trials investigating MCI and AD. The coronal image shows the hippocampus, the main structure involved in many forms of dementia.
Assessment of MR in Dementia:
* Lewy = Dementia with Lewy bodies An MR-study of a patient suspected of having dementia must be assessed in a standardized way. First of all, treatable diseases like subdural hematomas, tumors and hydrocephalus need to be excluded. Next we should look for signs of specific dementias such as: So when we study the MR images we should score in a systematic way for global atrophy, focal atrophy and for vascular disease (i.e. infarcts, white matter lesions, lacunes). When we study the MR images we must systematically score for global atrophy, focal atrophy and for vascular disease (i.e. infarcts, white matter lesions, lacunes). This standardized assessment of the MR findings in a patient suspected of having a cognitive disorder includes: Click on image to enlarge
GCA-scale for Global Cortical Atrophy:
GCA scale is the mean score for cortical atrophy throughout the complete cerebrum: The central sulcus is more posteriorly on more cranial images. Cortical atrophy is best scored on FLAIR images. In some neurodegenerative disorders the atrophy is asymmetric and occurs in specific regions. A radiological report should mention any regional atrophy or asymmetry. When assessing atrophy in different regions keep in mind that cranially, the central sulcus lies more posteriorly than you would expect (figure).
MTA-scale for Medial Temporal lobe Atrophy:
The MTA-score should be rated on coronal T1-weighted images at a consistent slice position. Select a slice through the corpus of the hippocampus, at the level of the anterior pons. 75 years : MTA-score 3 or more is abnormal (i.e. 2 can still be normal at this age) Data from a study with 222 controls and patients with various forms of dementia in which this visual rating scale was used to assess temporal lobe atrophy suggest that sensitivities and specificities of 85% can be obtained for patients with AD. The score is based on a visual rating of the width of the choroid fissure, the width of the temporal horn, and the height of the hippocampal formation. < 75 years: score 2 or more is abnormal. 75 years: score 3 or more is abnormal.

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images Here you can scroll through the images for examples of MTA score 0-4. < 75 years: score 2 or more is abnormal. 75 years: score 3 or more is abnormal. Medial temporal lobe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and in controls. A high MTA-score is very sensitive for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and is present in the vast majority of patients with AD, while in controls a positive score is almost always absent (table on the left). Therefore it is a good test to discern controls from patients with AD. This test is not completely specific for AD however, as MTA can also be found in other forms of dementias (7). On the other hand if a patient with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) a possible 'prodromal state of AD' has a negative MTA-score, it is very unlikely that this patient will develop AD (high sensitivity yields high negative predictive value), except in very young subjects, in whom a more posterior pattern of atrophy can be observed in AD. Coronal T1WI of the hippocampus demonstrating progressive atrophy in familial AD (images kindly provided by Nick Fox). If there is a strong suspicion of Alzheimer's disease, it can be useful to repeat the examination to see if there is any progress of the (medial temporal lobe) atrophy. The images show a follow-up examination at 18 and 36 months in a patient who was at risk for familial AD, demonstrating progression of the disease. An alternative approach would be to perform a SPECT- or PET-scan to look for changes in perfusion/metabolism of the temporo-parietal cortex, as these changes precede the development of atrophy.
Fazekas scale for WM lesions:
On MR, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunes - both of which are frequently observed in the elderly - are generally viewed as evidence of small vessel disease. The Fazekas-scale provides an overall impression of the presence of WMH in the entire brain. It is best scored on transverse FLAIR or T2-weighted images. Score: The Fazekas scale for WM lesions predicts future disability in elderly. Fazekas 1 is considered normal in the elderly. Fazekas 2 and 3 are pathologic, but may be seen in normally functioning individuals. They are however, at high risk for disability. In 600 normally functioning elderly people the Fazekas score predicted disability within one year (table).
In the Fazekas 3 group 25% was disabled within one year (10). Three year follow-up shows that severe white matter changes independently and strongly predict rapid global functional decline (17). Caps and bands
Normal ageing:
The findings in a normally aging brain can overlap with findings in dementia. As implicated earlier, there may be some degree of atrophy, though mainly of the white matter with increasing prominence of the perivascular (Virchow-Robin) spaces and non-specific fronto-parietal sulcal widening. There may also be some degree of medial temporal lobe atrophy. A MTA-score of 2 for individuals older than 75 years of age may be normal. As the brain ages, there is an increasing deposition of iron in specific areas of the brain: mainly the basal ganglia, nucleus ruber and pars reticluaris of the substantia nigra. There also may develop a rim of high signal intensity on T2W and FLAIR images around the ventricles, known as caps and bands (figure). A limited amount of white matter hyperintensities may also occur in the normally ageing brain (Fazekas grade 1). Lacunes are always pathological.
Strategic infarctions:
Strategic infarctions are infarctions in areas that are crucial for normal cognitive functioning of the brain. These areas are summarized in the table. Strategic infarctions are best seen on transverse FAIR and T2W sequences. The images show bilateral thalamic infarctions - lesions often associated with cognitive dysfunction. Transverse FLAIR images in two different patients. Study the images of two different patients. Then continue reading. The image on the far left shows an infarct in the vascular territory of the Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA), with involvement of the inferior medial temporal lobe which includes the hippocampus. This is a strategic infarction, since it is in the dominant hemisphere, it will result in cognitive dysfunction. The image next to it is a transverse FLAIR image showing another infarct in the PCA-territory, with involvement of the temporo-occipital association area. This is another example of a strategic infarction that can result in cognitive dysfunction.
Koedam score for Parietal Atrophy:
In addition to medial temporal lobe atrophy, parietal atrophy also has a positive predictive value in the diagnosis of AD. Atrophy of the precuneus is particularly characteristic of AD (15). This is particularly the case in young patients with AD (presenile AD), who may have normal MTA-scores. The Koedam scale rates parietal atrophy - assessed in sagittal, coronal and axial planes. In these planes, widening of the posterior cingulate and parieto-occipital sulci as well as parietal atrophy (including the precuneus) is rated (Table). Koedam scale grade 0-1 Koedam scale grade 0-1 Sagittal T1-, axial FLAIR- and coronal T1-weighted images illustrating the Koedam scale of posterior atrophy. When different scores are obtained in different orientations, the highest score must be considered (16). Koedam scale grade 2-3 Koedam scale grade 2-3 Sagittal T1-, axial FLAIR- and coronal T1-weighted images illustrating the Koedam scale of posterior atrophy. The yellow arrows point to extreme widening of the posterior cingulate en parieto-occipital sulci in a patient with grade 3 posterior atrophy.
FDG-PET:
In addition to clinical findings, CSF and MRI, PET-imaging is useful in diagnosing AD. In AD FDG-PET can show hypometabolism in the temporoparietal regions and/or the posterior cingulum. This may help differentiate AD from FTD, which shows frontal hypometabolism on FDG-PET. The images show FDG-PET and axial FLAIR images of a normal subject and of patients with AD and FTD. FDG-PET (top row) and axial FLAIR images of a normal subject and of AD and FTD patients. In AD there is a decreased metabolism of the parietal lobes (yellow arrows), whereas in FTD, there is frontal hypometablism (red arrows).
Specific Diseases:
The prevalence of specific forms of dementia is age-dependent. In patients
In patients > 65 years there are more cases of senile AD and vascular dementia. In many older patients with manifest AD there is co-existing vascular disease, which contributes to the demented state. Specimen in end stage AD demonstrating severe global atrophy. Courtesy Webpath (11).
Alzheimers Disease:
AD accounts for 50%-70% of all cases of dementia in the elderly population. Age is a strong risk factor, with the disease affecting approximately 8% of individuals over the age of 65 and 30% over the age of 85 years. The progression of AD is gradual and the average patient lives 10 years after the onset of symptoms. With the increasing percentage of elderly in the population, the prevalence of AD is expected to triple over the next 50 years. In end-stage AD there is widespread atrophy, which is no different from other end-stage dementias. In imaging we therefore have to try to identify AD in an earlier stage and we have to concentrate on the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobe, because that is where AD starts. The role of MRI in the diagnostic process of AD is twofold: Study the image, then continue reading. The findings are consistent with the diagnosis of end stage AD, because there is: It is not specific for AD however, since severe GCA occurs in other end-stage disorders as well Presenile AD with normal hippocampus and severe parietal atrophy.
Presenile AD:
Presenile AD (
Although there usually is some mild hippocampal atrophy, the most striking finding is parietal atrophy with atrophy of the posterior cingulum and the precuneus; the hippocampus can be normal.
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):
Mild cognitive impairment is a relatively recent term used to describe people who have some problems with their memory, but do not actually have dementia, since dementia is defined as having problems in two or more cognitive domains. Some of these patients will be in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease or another dementia, so it is important to identify them. Finding MTA is a strong risk-factor for progression to dementia. PCA infarction involving the medial temporal lobe.
Vascular Dementia (VaD):
Vascular dementia (VaD) is thought to be the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. It can sometimes be distinguished from AD by a more sudden onset and association with vascular risk factors. VaD can be characterized by its stepwise deterioration with periods of stability followed by sudden decline in cognitive function. Most patients, however, have small vessel disease, which is typified by a more gradual and subtle pattern of deterioration. Control of vascular risk factors is the treatment of choice, but cholinesterase inhibitors (drugs that are being used in AD) are also increasingly being used to treat vascular dementia. The images show a patient with a strategic PCA infarction involving the hippocampus. This type of infarct can result in sudden dementia if located in the dominant hemisphere. It will usually not result in dementia if it occurs in the non-dominant hemisphere. Vascular dementia, no medial temporal lobe atrophy. In most patients with VaD there is diffuse white matter disease with large confluent lesions (Fazekas 3). In some of these patients the ventricles may be dilated due to global atrophy and some will also have medial temporal lobe atrophy. The images are of a patient who had VaD, but the medial temporal lobe was normal.
Strategic infarcts and small vessel disease:
Cognitive dysfunction in VaD can be the result of (2): MTA in a patient with VaD There is an increasing awareness for the importance of small vessel disease as a predictor of cognitive decline and dementia. Moreover, it seems to amplify the effects of pathologic changes of Alzheimer's disease. On the left we see a patient who was diagnosed as having VaD. White matter disease is seen as severe WMH (hypointense on T1) in the periventricular regions. In addition to these vascular changes, there is also MTA. Presumably this patient has both VaD and AD, a finding seen in many elderly patients. These findings should be described separately as it may have therapeutic consequences. The problem however is, that white matter hyperintensities and lacunes are also frequently observed in non-demented elderly and at some level can be regarded as normal findings in aging. To overcome this problem the NINDS-AIREN International Work Group has formulated criteria for the history and physical, radiological, (see above) and pathological examination to classify patients as having possible, probable and definite VaD. However considerable interobserver variability exists for the assessment of the radiological part of these NINDS-AIREN criteria and some level of training is mandatory (2). Bilateral medial strategic thalamus infarctions The medial nuclei of the thalamus play an important role in memory and learning. A large unilateral infarction or bilateral infarctions in this region can cause dementia. You have to pay special attention to these areas to find these small infarctions. FLAIR misses thalamus infarctions On FLAIR images you will easily miss these infarctions, because they can be isointense to the surrounding structures (8). A high resolution T2WI is needed to detect these thalamic infarcts. FLAIR in the infratentorial region and in the spinal cord is of limited value as it suppresses not only the signal of water, but also pathology with a long T1-relaxation time. This phenomenon can also be seen in the detection of Multiple Sclerosis, where FLAIR is of limited value in the infratentorial region and of no use in the spinal cord. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy
Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA):
Dementia may be the clinical presentation in CAA, a condition in which ?-amyloid is deposited in the vessel walls of the brain. The result is hemorrhage, usually microhemorrhages, but also subarachnoid hemorrhage or lobar hematomas may occur. On MR, the T2* sequence will show multiple microhemorrhages, typically in a peripheral location (as opposed to hypertensive microhemorrhages, which are usually more centrally located, e.g. in the basal ganglia and thalami). In addition, FLAIR will reveal moderate to sever white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas grade 2 or 3) T2* images in a patient with CAA show multiple peripherally located microbleeds. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy FLAIR images of the same patient show Fazekas 2 white matter hyprintensities. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy T2* images in a patient with CAA microbleeds. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy T2* images demonstrate multiple lobar microbleeds in a patient with CAA. End stage FTLD with striking atrophy of frontal and temporal lobes. No artophy of parietal and occipital lobes. Courtesy Webpath (11).
Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD ):
FTLD, formerly called Pick's disease, is a progressive dementia, that accounts for 5-10% of cases of dementia., and occurs relatively more frequently in presenile subjects FTLD is clinically characterized by behavioral and language disturbances that may precede or overshadow memory deficits. There is currently no treatment for this condition. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis as the findings are easy to recognize. Radiological findings are pronounced atrophy of frontal and / or temporal lobes. In some forms of FTLD the atrophy might be strikingly asymmetric, e.g. in Semantic Dementia, a disease subtype with progressive aphasia and left-sided temporal lobe degeneration. FTLD: T2WI and FLAIR with 'knife blade' atrophy of left temporal lobe with normal right temporal lobe The images are of a patient with progressive aphasia. The most prominent finding is the striking asymmetric atrophy of the temporal lobe on the left side with not only atrophy of the hippocampus, but also the temporal poles. The atrophy has resulted in gyri that appear as sharp as knives ('knife blade atrophy'). There is also some increased signal intensity seen on the FLAIR image, probably due to gliosis. These findings are pathognomonic for the diagnosis of FTLD. Patients with left-sided temporal atrophy are usually clinically obvious. Right-sided atrophy is usually not as easily recognized as these patients only present with subtle disturbances in recognizing faces. Lewy body dementia: normal hippocampus
Dementia with Lewy bodies:
Dementia with Lewy bodies is responsible for approximately 25% of dementias and belongs to the atypical Parkinson syndromes together with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multi-system atrophy (MSA). The clinical manifestations can be similar to that of AD or dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. Patients typically present with one of three symptom complexes: detailed visual hallucinations, Parkinson-like symptoms and fluctuations in alertness and attention. Pathologically, the disease is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in various regions of the hippocampal complex, subcortical nuclei and neocortex with a variable number of diffuse amyloid plaques. Cholinesterase inhibitors are currently the treatment of choice for this condition. The role of imaging is limited in Lewy body dementia. Usually the MR of the brain is normal, including the hippocampus. This finding is important as it enables us to differentiate this disease from Alzheimer';s disease, the main differential diagnosis. Nuclear imaging can be used to demonstrate an abnormal dopaminergic system (so-called DaTscan) PSP with midbrain atrophy
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP):
PSP is also one of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. In PSP there is pronounced atrophy of the midbrain (mesencephalon), which accounts for the typical upward gaze paralysis. PSP: 'humming bird sign' due to midbrain atrophy Normally the upper border of the midbrain is convex. The atrophy of the midbrain in PSP results in a concave upper border of the midbrain with the typical 'humming bird sign' (figure). 'Hot cross bun sign' in MSA
Multi System Atrophy (MSA):
MSA is also one of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. MSA is a rare neurological disorder characterized by a combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar and pyramidal signs, and autonomic dysfunction. MSA can be classified as MSA-C, MSA-P or MSA-A. In MSA-C (formerly known as sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy or sOPCA) the cerebellar symptoms predominate, whereas in MSA-P the parkinsonian symptoms dominate (MSA-P was formerly known as striatonigral degeneration). MSA-A is the form in which autonomic dysfunction predominates and is the new term for what was formerly known as Shy-Drager syndrome. In MSA there is pronounced cerebellar atrophy and severe atrophy of the pons. In MSA-P: low T2 SI dorsolateral putamen and slit-like increased SI lateral to putamen on T2. In contrast to PSP, we don't see the humming bird sign, because the midbrain has a normal convex upper border. The so-called 'hot cross bun sign', which is a result of pontine hyperintensity, is typical for MSA-C. Notice the extreme atrophy of the pons and the cerebellum in this patient when we compare images of 2015 with images of 2018. Changes in the neocortex as seen on FLAIR (left) and DWI (right)
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD):
CJD is a very rare and incurable neurodegenerative disease, caused by a unique type of infectious agent called a prion. The first symptom of CJD is rapidly progressive dementia, leading to memory loss, personality changes and hallucinations. The disease is characterized by spongiform changes in the cortical and subcortical gray matter, with loss of neurons and replacement by gliosis. The abnormalities can sometimes be detected on FLAIR, but are most conspicuous on DWI sequences, affecting either the striatum, the neo-cortex, or a combination of both. Pulvinar hyperintensity in new variant of CJD. Courtesy Dr. Collie (12) New variant CJD New variant of CJD is also known as the 'mad cow disease' (12). It is a disease fortunately hardly encountered anymore. In this variant the changes are seen in the posterior part of the thalamus, called the pulvinar. Corticobasal degeneration
Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD):
CBD is a rare entity which may present with cognitive dysfunction, usually in combination with Parkinson-like symptoms. The so-called 'Alien-hand' syndrome is a typical manifestation. MRI shows asymmetric parietal cortical atrophy, sometimes with associated hyperintensity of the white matter on T2W images. Axial FLAIR image shows striking asymmetric cortical parietal atrophy in a patient with CBD.
Huntington Disease:
Huntington disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease (autosomal dominant trait, but often de novo mutations), and can present with early onset dementia as well as choreoathetosis and psychosis. Imaging shows characteristic atrophy of the caudate nucleus and subsequent enlargement of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.
Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencehalopathy (CADASIL):
CADASIL is another hereditary disease which may present with a progressive cognitive dysfunction. Other presenting symptoms include migraines, stroke-like episodes and behavioral disturbances. It affects the small vessels of the brain. Confluent white matter hyperintesities in the frontal and especially anterior temporal lobes in combination with (lacunar) infarcts and microbleeds are seen on imaging. The FLAIR images show classic findings in CADASIL - confluent white matter hyperintensities with lacunar infarcts and involvement of the anterior temporal lobes. Traumatic brain injury
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):
Long term sequelae of traumatic brain injury such as cerebral contusions and diffuse axonal injury (DAI) may include cognitive impairment. Frontobasal/temporal parenchymal loss or T2* black dots typical for DAI in a patient with a history of trauma must therefore be taken into consideration when assessing MR images for dementia. The FLAIR images show classic post-traumatic tissue loss with gliosis in both frontal lobes, the left occipital lobe and right temporal lobe. In the book on the left you can find more information about the role of MR in dementia (9). Neuroimaging in Dementia
MR protocol:
Protocol that is used in the Alzheimer Centre in Amsterdam Coronal-oblique T1-weighted images  are used for the assessment of medial temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy. They are obtained in a plane orthogonal to the long axis of the hippocampus; this plane is orientated parallel to the brainstem. These should be thin-section images and are ideally obtained by reformatting a sagittal 3D T1 sequence through the entire brain. Additional sagittal reconstructions will enable the assessment of midline structures as well as parietal atrophy, which may be involved in certain neurodegenerative disorders. FLAIR images are used to assess global cortical atrophy (GCA), vascular white matter hyperintensities and infarctions. T2-weighted images are used to assess infarctions, in particular lacunar infarctions in the thalamus and basal ganglia, which can be missed on FLAIR images. T2*-weighted images are necessary to detect microbleeds in amyloid angiopathy. These images can also depict calcifications and iron deposition. DWI should be considered as a supplemental sequence in young patients or in rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorders (DD - vasculitis, CJD). CT with negative scan angle for optimal vizualisation of the hippocampus in the transverse plane
CT protocol:
CT can be useful when contraindications prevent MRI or when the only reason for imaging is to rule out surgically treatable causes of cognitive decline. In the transverse plane the scan angle should be parallel to the long axis of the temporal lobe. Use of multi-detector CT will enable coronally reformatted images to be reconstructed perpendicular to the long axis of the temporal lobe for optimal vizualisation of the hippocampus. Spiral CT of the brain with coronal reconstructions. Use of multi-detector CT will enable coronally reformatted images to be reconstructed perpendicular to the long axis of the temporal lobe for optimal vizualisation of the hippocampus.

Ankle fractures - Weber and Lauge-Hansen Classification:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology Department of the Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2012-08-23 Classification of ankle fractures is important in order to estimate the extent of the injury and the stability of the joint. The Weber classification focuses on the integrity of the fibula and the syndesmosis, which holds the ankle mortise together. The Lauge-Hansen system focuses on the trauma mechanism. Adding the stages of Lauge-Hansen to the Weber system will help you to predict ligamentous injury and instability. This article will help you to correctly stage ankle injuries and to detect fractures, that are not obvious at first sight.
Short overview:
Basically there are three main types of ankle fractures. Weber classified them as: These fractures are identical to the fractures described by Lauge-Hansen as supination-adduction, supination-exorotation and pronation-exorotation. We will first give a short overview of these fractures and then discuss them in more detail. Once you understand the trauma mechanism as described by Lauge-Hansen and the sequence of events that take place in stages, then you know where to look for fractures and ligamentous injuries.

Weber A:
Occurs below the syndesmosis, which is intact. According to Lauge-Hansen, it is the result of an adduction force on the supinated foot. Scroll through the images. Notice that the fibular fracture is transverse, because it is an avulsion or pull-off fracture. The tibial fracture is vertical or oblique, because it is a push-off fracture. Enable Scroll

Weber B:
This is a transsyndesmotic fracture with usually partial - and less commonly, total - rupture of the syndesmosis. According to Lauge-Hansen, it is the result of an exorotation force on the supinated foot. Scroll through the images. Notice the oblique or vertical orientation of the push-off fibular fracture.

Weber C:
This is a fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. Usually there is a total rupture of the syndesmosis with instability of the ankle. According to Lauge-Hansen, it is the result of an exorotation force on the pronated foot. Scroll through the images
Exorotation injury:
Weber A fractures are usually not a problem. Weber B and C are more difficult and it is essential to understand the sequence of events in these injuries, which are both exorotation injuries. This implies that 75-80% of ankle injuries are exorotation injuries. Weber B starts anterolaterally and the sequence is: Weber C starts medially and the sequence is:
Ligamentous rupture or Avulsion:
Another important thing to remember is, that a ligament can rupture or cause an avulsion fracture at the insertion. Every ligamentous rupture has it's avulsion fracture counterpart.

Weber and Lauge-Hansen combined:
How does it work when we combine the Weber classification to the stages of Lauge-Hansen? In daily practice most use the Weber system, which is easy to memorize, while the Lauge-Hansen seems rather difficult at first glance. Combining the simplicity of Weber with the explanation of the trauma mechanism given by Lauge-Hansen has the advantage that you still use a simple system, but now you really know what is going on. For instance if you see a fracture that is a stage 2 in the Lauge-Hansen system, then you know that there also is a stage 1 injury and you will study the radiographs with a high suspicion for signs of stage 3 and 4. This can best be demonstrated by giving an example. Unstable ankle fracture The radiographs show a fracture of the posterior malleolus. If you would just report this as - a fracture of the posterior malleolus - you would miss the point. This is probably an unstable ankle fracture. A posterior malleolus fracture as an isolated finding is very uncommon. When we look at the scheme we will notice that a fracture of the posterior malleolus in most cases is part of a Weber B or a Weber C fracture. A tertius fracture is either Weber B stage 3
or - due to Weber C stage 4 (arrows). We have to re-examine the films to look for additional findings. Since we now know where to look, it will be easier to detect additional findings. PE stage 1 On the ankle films there was no sign of an oblique fracture of the lateral malleolus, so we can exclude a Weber B fracture. There is still the possibility of a Weber C fracture stage 4, i.e. medial rupture or avulsion, high fibular fracture and finally a posterior malleolus fracture. At reexamination you notice the subtle avulsion of the medial malleolus (red arrow), which is stage 1. Notice also the soft tissue swelling on the medial side (blue arrow) PE stage 3 Additional radiographs of the lower extremity were ordered and they demonstrate a high fibular fracture, i.e. Weber C stage 3 also known as a Maisonneuve fracture. Weber C fracture stage 4. This is un unstable ankle injury that needs surgical repair. Understanding the fracture mechanism and the stages according to Lauge-Hansen helps you to make the right diagnosis This example is an every day case. The point that I want to make is, that when you understand the sequence of injuries to the ankle, then you know where to look for fractures and soft tissue swelling indicating ligamentous injury.
Weber A in detail:
We will now discuss the Weber classification and add the stages of the Lauge-Hansen system. Weber A is seen in 20-25% of all ankle fractures. The diagnosis as well as the treatment is usually no problem. According to Lauge-Hansen the fracture results from an adduction force on the supinated foot. The lateral side is under extreme tension with stretch on the ligaments which results in an avulsion fracture. Almost always the avulsion is seen as a horizontal fracture. This is called a pull off  type of fracture in contrast to a push off type, which is seen as an oblique or vertical fracture. Weber-A stage I
Stage 1:
Weber C is seen in approximately 20% of ankle fractures. It is the most difficult fracture to diagnose and the Lauge-Hansen system will help you to understand the fracture-mechanism, as this will be an enormous help. According to Lauge-Hansen the fracture results from an exorotation force on the pronated foot. Stage 1 The first injury will occur on the medial side, which is under maximum tension due to the pronation. It will lead to rupture of the medial collateral ligament or avulsion of the medial malleolus. Now the injury can stop and there will only be a rupture of the medial collateral ligaments or avulsion of the medial malleolus. Lauge Hansen calls this PE stage 1. We can not cathegorize this in the Weber classification, since there is no fibular fracture. In many cases the injury progresses to a higher stage.
Stage 2:
Stage 2 is uncommon and easy to detect. More adduction force results in the medial malleolus being pushed off in a vertical or oblique way. Stage 2 is unstable because the ring of the ankle is broken in two places. Notice the horizontal orientation of the lateral malleolus fracture and the vertical orientation of the fracture of the medial malleolus. Enormous forces must have pushed off the medial malleolus. More on the ring of the ankle and instability
Weber B in detail:
Stage 1: Rupture of anterior tibiofibular ligament - or avulsion fracture (Tilleaux)
Stage 1-2:
Weber B is the most common type of ankle fracture and occurs in about 60 %. According to Lauge-Hansen the fracture results from an exorotation force on the supinated foot. Stage 1 is usually not visible on x-rays. What we normally see is a stage 2 oblique fracture through the syndesmosis and we have to assume that there is also a rupture of the anterior tibiofibular ligament, which is stage 1. According to Lauge Hansen the first injury is on the lateral side, which is under maximum tension. In stage 2 the talus exorotates further and since the foot is in supination, the lateral malleolus is held tightly in place by the lateral collateral ligaments. The lateral malleolus cannot move away without breaking. As a result more rotation of the talus will fracture the fibula in an oblique or spiral fashion because the lateral malleolus is pushed off from anteromedially to posterolaterally. The images show a Weber B fracture. The oblique course of the fracture is typical for Weber B and results from the exorotation of the talus that pushes against the fixed lateral malleolus. The malleolar fracture usually starts medially at the level of the talar dome, but can also start a few centimeters above this level. Weber B - stage 3 and 4
Stage 3-4:
Stage 3 More posterior displacement of the lateral malleolus fragment by the talus results in tension on the posterior syndesmosis with rupture or avulsion of the posterior malleolus. Stage 4 Further posterior movement of the talus will result in extreme tension on the medial side and the deltoid ligament will either rupture or pull off the medial malleolus in the transverse plane. The sequences in a Weber B fracture or Lauge-Hansen supination exorotation injury take place in a clockwise manner: Immediately after the injury the injured parts may again align, which can make it difficult to detect the injuries. Weber B fracture The radiographs show a typical Weber B fracture. First study the images and then continue reading. Do you see what stage this is? This is a Weber B stage 4 injury. Notice that all 4 stages are visible: These images show another typical Weber B fracture stage 4. There is an oblique fracture of the fibula. There is an avulsion of the posterior malleolus and an avulsion of the medial malleolus. Here another typical Weber B fracture stage 4. First notice the oblique fibular fracture, which is best seen on the lateral view. This is stage 2 and we have to assume, that the anterior syndesmosis is ruptured. On the lateral view a small tertius fragment is seen indicating stage 3. Now you start looking for stage 4 and you will notice the subtle lucency in the medial malleolus on the AP view (green arrow). Knowing the stages of Lauge Hansen this must be a fracture. Here a more subtle case. At first impression there is a Weber B fracture stage 2. Now we start looking for stage 3, which is a tertius fracture. The small linear density on the AP-view is enough to diagnose a tertius fracture. The soft tissue swelling on the medial side is probably a rupture of the medial collateral band , i.e. stage 4.
Weber C in detail:

Stage 2-3:
The talus rotates externally and moves laterally because it is free from its medial attachment. Due to the pronation, the lateral ligaments are not under tension and the fibula can move away from the tibia. This causes rupture of the anterior syndesmosis. This is stage 2. Continuous force will twist the fibula and displace it distally, while proximally it is fixed to the tibia. Finally the interosseus membrane will rupture up to the point where the fibular shaft fractures. This is stage 3. This is always above the level of the syndesmosis. In many cases it is visible on the radiographs of the ankle, but in some cases the fracture is located high and will only be visible on a radiograph of the lower leg. This last type of fracture is also called Maisonneuve fracture. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Here we see the different stages in the axial plane. Scroll through the images. Weber C fracture - stage 3 The radiographs shows a Weber C fracture. There is an avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus and a fibula fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. According to Lauge-Hansen this is stage 3 pronation exorotation injury and so the anterior syndesmosis (stage 2) must also be ruptured. We do not see a tertius fracture, which would indicate stage 4, but there may be a rupture of the posterior syndesmosis. Weber C fracture - at least stage 3 Here an example of a Weber C fracture with a proximal fibula fracture. Notice that on the radiograph of the ankle no fracture is seen. You might misdiagnose this as only some soft tissue swelling. In fact this is an unstable ankle fracture, since there also must be a rupture of the medial collateral ligament (stage 1) , so the ring is broken in two places leading to instability. According to Lauge Hansen we are probably dealing with:
Stage 4:
Finally the posterior syndesmotic ligament ruptures, or there is an avulsion of the posterior malleolus, also known as posterior malleolus fracture (red arrow). The medial clear space is only slightly widened, but based on the stages of Lauge Hansen there must be a collateral band rupture.

How to Differentiate Carotid Obstructions:
Adriaan van Es
Leiden University Medical Centre in Leiden, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 1-2-2023 In patients with an acute stroke and
an intracranial large vessel occlusion, we need to know if there is carotid
pathology and if so what kind of pathology we are dealing with. This is important for procedural
planning and the technical execution of endovascular treatment. Furthermore,
carotid artery pathology determines secondary profylaxis with either carotid
endarterectomy, stenting or anti-platelet therapy. The most common carotid obstruction
is caused by atherosclerosis. 
In this article we will discuss how to
differentiate this type of carotid obstruction from an obstruction caused by a
carotid dissection or a  pseudo-occlusion Other pathology that we will discuss
is the floating thrombus, the carotid web and the isolated internal carotid
artery. 
An isolated internal carotid artery is an unfavourable configuration of
the circle of Willis which can lead to severe ischemia in case of a ICA
occlusion. 
A carotid web is an entity that is increasingly recognized as an
important cause for ischemic stroke in especially  young females.
Overview:
AtherosclerosisAtherosclerotic plaques are
mostly located at the level of the
bulbus. Atherosclerosis  is usually
bilateral and frequently calcifications
can be seen. Subtotal stenosisIn a high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis
the flow through the internal carotid is  severely decreased and results in a collapse
and consequently a small caliber of the vessel
distal to the occlusion. OcclusionIn a total occlusion the contrast has a { or curly bracket-like configuration. DissectionIn the case of a ICA dissection the bulbus is not involved and the
contrast in the proximal ICA has a flame-shaped  configuration. The total diameter of the ACI
is widened due to the formation of a mural hematoma. The narrowed eccentric true lumen is surrounded by a
crescent-shaped mural on transversal imaging. The
compressed true lumen can be occluded in case of severe compression. Pseudo-occlusionThis simulates an occlusion
of the lower cervical part of the internal carotid, but is actually the
result of a stop at the carotid T-top. Contrast that tries to enter the
internal carotid will give a waterpaint appearance due to this outflow
obstruction. Carotid webThis is  a thin shelf-like luminal protrusion of the
intimal fibrous tissue that extends from the posterior aspect of the proximal internal carotid artery bulb into the lumen.
The carotid web is increasingly being associated with ischemic stroke in young
individuals, especially females. Study showing that differentiation between carotid dissection and pseudo-occlusion is difficult There is a problem diagnosing carotid dissection versus pseudo-obstruction. In a study in which the CTA-findings
were compared to tDSA (golden standard for carotid lesions), the results showed
that there was a high accuracy in diagnosing atherosclerotic occlusions and
high grade stenoses of the internal carotid artery. Only one atherosclerotic stenosis was
misdiagnosed as a pseudo-occlusion. On the other hand pseudo-occlusions
were misdiagnosed as carotid dissection and dissections were misdiagnosed as
pseudo-occlusions quite frequently (red circles). In the chapters below we will discuss
how to differentiate dissection from pseudo-occlusion. Tandem occlusions are intracranial occlusions
combined with a severe (>70% ) stenosis or occlusion of the ICA.
They are found
in up to 30% of all patients presenting with a large vessel occlusion. 
The accompanying
ICA pathology is not a contra-indication for endovascular therapy for the
intracranial occlusion, regardless of the underlying  ethiology of the ICA stenosis/occlusion. However identifying carotid pathology is important for planning and
execution of the endovascular procedure.
Atherosclerosis:
Typical findings in an
atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion are: These patients are usually
older and have cardiovascular risk factors.
ICA stenosis measurement:
The illustration shows the formula for measuring the degree of stenosis according to the NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial). The diameter of the stenosis (a) should be measured perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vessel (green line) and not in a pure axial plane (red line), because then you may underestimate the degree of stenosis.
It is compared to the diameter of the normal vessel at about 6 cm distal to the stenosis (b).
In the formula the degree of stenosis is calculated. Calcifications are common in atherosclerotic
stenosis and CTA has a high sensitivity in detecting these calcified
structures. Sometimes a bias in the exact
evaluation of stenosis degree may be caused by the high attenuation values of
the calcified plaques. 
This might lead to an overestimation of the degree of
stenosis. 
Furthermore, heavily calcified plaques can be a challenge for the
interventional neuroradiologist as the stenosis needs to passed with a large
bored guiding catheter or long sheath (at least 6 Fr).
Near occlusion:
In a severe stenosis or near occlusion the diameter of the ACI above the level of the stenosis is diminished and less than the caliber of the contralateral ICA and the ipsilateral ECA. In a total occlusion the contrast has a { or curly bracket-like configuration, which is unlike an occlusion in a dissection or in a pseudo-occlusion. Click on image for an enlarged view. Small distal caliber of the distal ICA and a drop in systolic peak velocity. Near occlusion (2) In this case the common carotid artery has a normal diameter (image 1).
There is a severe stenosis with a partly calcified plaque at the level of the bulbus (2).
The ICA above the stenosis shows a small caliber (3). See also the arrow in the sagittal reconstruction. The criteria for near occlusion are: The peak velocity with US-doppler normally increases in relation to the severity of a stenosis, but when there is a near-occlusion the systolic peak velocity will drop to very low levels like in this case (20 cm/sec). Continue with the sagittal images... Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll You can scroll through the sagittal images. Notice the calcified plaque at the level of the bulbus and the small caliber of the distal ICA, which is less than the caliber of the ECA. TreatmentTreatment strategy for near occlusion
(NO) is still controversial. In the analyses conducted in randomized controlled
trials such as the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial
(NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST), it was reported that
the risk of stroke was low with medical treatment, and surgical therapy was not
beneficial for internal carotid NO.However, an 11%–33% risk of ipsilateral
stroke within the first year has also been reported in medically treated
patients. Furthermore, other authors have
reported a significantly lower risk of future stroke after Carotid endarterectomy or Carotid artery stenting in these
patients. Seeking safe interventional
procedures could, therefore, be worthwhile especially with the current improvements
in carotid stenting technique .
Occlusion:
In a total atherosclerotic occlusion the contrast has a { or curly bracket-like configuration.
The stop will be at the level of the bulbus.
Carotid Dissection:
A carotid dissection is the result of
a tear in the intima of the vessel wall. As blood enters between the layers of
the vessel wall an intramural hematoma is created. This intramural hematoma results in the following: Dissections cause about 2% of all ischemic strokes, but account for 10%−25% of ischemic strokes in young people.
Patients sometimes present with pain in the neck and may have a history of a previous trauma. On CTA a dissection presents with the
following findings: Flame-shaped ICA These images show the typical flame-shaped presentation of a carotid dissection on sagittal CTA reconstructions and DSA. Notice that on the CTA reconstruction you can follow the contours of the dilated ICA above the level where the contrast stops.
Also notice how similar the images are, when you compare the CTA with the DSA. String sign In most cases a dissection will
present with a flame-shaped appearance like in A, but when the lumen is less
compressed and still partially patent you
may get the "string sign" as in B. Look below the skull base When you consider the possibility of a dissection, t is important to study the axial images just below the skull base as in this case. On the left side there is a normal ICA and ECA (the high density structure in between them is the styloid process).
On the right side we see a normal ECA and medial to the jugular vein is the dilated ICA (circle).
The lumen does not fill with contrast.
The combination of an occlusion in an enlarged and dilated ICA means that we are dealing with a dissection. A dissection stops at the skull base This patient has a carotid
dissection. In A we see the compressed lumen in
an eccentric position (green arrow). The diameter of the ICA is enlarged
by the intramural hematoma (red arrowheads). When we follow the ICA cranially, the
dissection continues up to image E (arrowheads). At the level of the skull base, where
the ICA enters the carotid canal (vertical petrous segment) , the dissection
stops and the ICA has a normal appearance (yellow arrow). Hyperdense thrombi A typical finding in dissection are
hyperdense thrombi as in these two patients. Whenever you see these kind of extremely
hyperdense thrombi, think of dissection and scroll down to just below the skull
base.
These thrombi are almost completely composed of erythrocytes. Dissection on DSA All the findings that we discussed on CTA are similar and even more obvious on DSA. The mural hematoma is for a large part lysed through the iv-treatment of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA, alteplase) prior to endovascular treatment. The intima flap is still visible. Again
you can seen the intimal flap stopping at the level of the skull base.
Pseudo-Occlusion:
Pseudo-occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery refers to an isolated occlusion of the distal intracranial ICA that mimicks an extracranial ICA occlusion on CTA or DSA. In pseudo-occlusion it looks as if there is a total occlusion in the ICA just above the level of the bulbus.
The contrast that enters the ICA has difficulty to move up further cranially, because of the stagnant blood within the ICA, since the ICA has no major side branches. 
The contrast will only slowly penetrate this stagnant blood column and this results in a waterpaint appearance. On CTA you will see a gradually
diminishing contrast density in the ACI with a water paint appearance. The
problem is the outflow obstruction at the level of the carotid T-top. A
pseudo-occlusion is never seen in combination with a more distal occlusion. 
For
example, in case of a M2 occlusion there will be sufficient outflow of the
distal ICA through the other patent  M2
division and the ACA. Two cases of a carotid pseudo-occlusion. In the first case (left) the contrast
stop is rather abrupt, although a small zone of diminishing contrast density can
be seen.
In this case the differentiation between a pseudo-occlusion and a dissection or atherosclerotic occlusion
can be difficult. 
However, we do not see the typical flame shape
configuration of the bulbus as seen in a dissection and we see no signs of
atherosclerosis (no plaque or calcifications). In the second case the gradually
dimishing contrast density is cleary seen over a longer course (arrowheads). 
This
is clearly a carotid pseudo-occlusion. Continue with the DSA images... Pseudo-occlusion with DSA The DSA gives us comparable images. In this patient during catheter
angiography, first there was a typical waterpaint appearance of the contrast
in the ICA, which simulated a proximal occlusion in the ICA. However the catheter could easily be  advanced  into
the distal  ICA. After a more
forceful contrast injection there is a typical carotid-top occlusion on the
lateral view (just above the level of the ophthalmic artery.
There is no contrast filling
of the intracerebral vessels.
Floating Thrombus:
On the saggital view there is a longitudinal filling defect
in the proximal internal carotid artery (arrowheads). 
This filling defect is a
floating thrombus attached to a atherosclerotic plaque located at the carotid
bulb (white arrow). In the axial plane this floatig thrombus causes a central
filling defect in the ICA also now as a “donut sign” (arrowhead). In case of an
accompanying intracranial occlusion of a large vessel endovascular therapy is
initiated to open this intracranial occlusion. 
An isolated floating thrombus
(no large vessel occlusion) is treated with heparine or
anti-platelet therapy .
Carotid Web:
A carotid web is a shelf-like lesion along the posterior wall of the internal carotid artery bulb and an under-recognized cause of stroke in young individuals. 
Several studies suggest that patients with a carotid web have a high risk of recurrent stroke. In the MR CLEAN study 30 patients with a carotid web ipsilateral to the stroke were identified.
In this study 1 out of every 6 patients with a symptomatic carotid web had a recurrent stroke within 2 years, suggesting that medical management alone may not provide sufficient protection for patients with a carotid web. On the saggital view of the
CTA the shelf-like protusion on the dorsal wall of the ICA bulbus is seen. This
is the typical configuration location for a carotid web. However, for the
definite diagnosis of a carotid web a ridge connecting the lateral and medial
wall of the internal carotid artery must be seen in the axial view (arrow right
image). Carotid webs can differ in size. 
In this case the
carotid web is much smaller than in te previous example. 
However, the imaging
criteria for the diagnosis of a carotid web still apply. 
On the sagittal images
a self-like protrusion is seen on the dorsal aspect of the internal carotid
artery (arrow left image).
On the axial images the ridge of the carotid web
is seen connecting the lateral and medial wall of the internal carotid artery (arrow). If you only look at the axial images,
you may miss a web. The red arrow points at the ICA and
ECA, but no web is seen.. Only with by angulating the axial
plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the ICA (green line and green
arrow) you will notice the web  (ridge
connecting the lateral and medial wall of the ICA.
Of course the sagittal
reconstructions are superior for detecting a web. Correlation carotid web and cerebral ischemia These DSA images cleary demonstrate
the mechanism by which carotid webs cause cerebral infarctions. 
On the first
angiographic images  you might first a stenosis
(white arrow left image).
On the next image the web is clearly  delineated (yellow arrow). On in the late arterial phase  view t stasis of contrast  is seen directly cranial of the web.  
It is clear, that in this region, due to
turbulence and stasis thrombi can develop and can cause cerebral emboli.
Isolated Carotid:
An isolated carotid means that the
ICA supplies blood to the ipsilateral anterior and middle cerebral artery, but
that there is no connection to the contralateral side or posterior circulation,
because the anterior (Acom) and posterior (Pcom) communicating artery are
missing as an anatomic variant. This is one of the many variants of
the circle of Willis. Patent circle of Willis Let us first describe the most common
situation. In 90% of patients the circle of
Willis is patent. When these patients present with an
acute stroke as a result of a dissection, they usually have an embolus in the
middle cerebral artery. In those cases it is sufficient to
treat the intracranial occlusion and the dissected carotid artery can be left
untreated. The collateral circulation over the
patent circle of Willis will take over the blood flow to the middle cerebral
artery. Non-patent circle of Willis In 10% of cases the circle of Willis
is insufficient. In this case both the anterior and
posterior communicans artery are absent. If there is an occlusion of the ACI,
then the patient is at risk for a massive stroke in both the anterior and
middle cerebral artery territory, since there is no collateral flow from the
contralateral ICA. We will demonstrate this scenario in
the following case... Case A 35-year-old woman presented at the ER with speech difficulties and a paresis of the right arm. The NECT did not show signs of a bleeding or infarction.
On the CECT there was normal enhancement of the intracerebral vessels, which means no intracerebral occlusion. Within 20 minutes she was treated with IV trombolyse, which resulted in partial recovery. One hour later however there was a deterioration with hemiparalysis on the right and aphasia.
The NIHSS was 27. Subsequently she was transported to the intervention center.
Continue with the CTA of the neck... The CTA of the neck shows the typical
flame shape of the proximal ICA indicating a dissection. Continue with the axial slices... The axial image shows a dilated left ICA with an eccentric compressed lumen. In conclusion there is a 35-year old women with a massive stroke (NIHSS = 27), a carotid occlusion as a result of a dissection, but no intracranial occlusion. At that moment the questions were: The DSA of the left ICA confirmed the
dissection (arrowheads) by demonstrating the flame shaped configuration of the proximal
ICA . Subsequently a DSA of the right ICA
and the left vertebral artery was performed. 
The angiography of the right ICA showed
an absent Acom as not contrast crossed from right to left. In addition,
contrast injection in the left vertebral artery showed an absence of a Pcom. This was proof of the diagnosis
"Isolated carotid artery". Poor perfusion in the anterior and middle cerebral artery territory (all penumbra, no infarct core on CBV images (not shown) Now what is the explanation for the contrast
filling  of the left middle cerebral
artery as the left ACI is occluded and there is no collateral flow through the
circle of Willis? The explanation is, that there are
small collaterals between the external carotid artery (ECA) and the ICA. This is enough to to fill the ACM
with contrast , but this is not sufficient for adequate perfusion of the left
hemisfere. 
This is clearly demonstrated on the perfusion images. During the interventional procedure
the flow was restored due to repositioning of the intimal flap caused by the
catheter manipulation. Carotid stent placement was considered but not
performed.
The patient was treated with Fraxiparine After 24 hours there was a NIHSS: 2
with only a mild aphasia, after 3 months the NIHSS was down to 0. Follow-up MRI after one month showed
a small left frontal infarction (white arrow). The left ICA was patent and showed a remaining
of the intramural hematoma with high signal on the T1W-image (arrowhead). Valeria Guglielmi et al. JAMA Neurol 2021 Jul 1;78(7):826-833

Hip pathology in Children:

Imaging findings:
Joosje Bomer and Herma Holscher
Juliana Children's hospital, the Hague, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2015-08-11 In this review we will discuss the most common imaging findings in children with hip pain.
Introduction:

Differential diagnosis:
Children with hip pathology may present with hip pain or a limp. The differential diagnosis can be narrowed down according to age (see Table). Young children in particular may have difficulty localizing or communicating the location of their pain; and sometimes children who initially seem to have a hip problem actually have underlying pathology of the knee or foot.
Imaging:
In children from 2 to 10 years old with symptoms less than 5 days, and in the absence of high fever or elevated inflammatory markers - a wait-and-see policy is recommended. In these cases the diagnosis is usually transient synovitis, which is a spontaneously resolving condition. Sometimes the referring physician will request an ultrasound to confirm the presence of a joint effusion. In all other cases x-ray imaging should be performed. The diagram shows a practical approach to hip pain and a new limp. Click on the image to enlarge. It is important to realize that early in the course of Perthes disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteomyelitis and septic arthritis, the initial radiographs may be normal. Because young children may have difficulty communicating the problem, it may be necessary to image the entire extremity. In most cases osseous pathology can be excluded with a frog-leg lateral (or Lauenstein) view only. In case of suspected pathology on the frog-leg lateral view, an additional AP radiograph should also be acquired for orthopedic and follow-up purposes. Children with cerebral palsy are at an increased risk for hip dislocation, and in these cases an AP-view is recommended. An AP-view is also recommended in other situations an adequate frog-leg lateral view is not possible. Lead Shielding The reduction of gonadal radiation exposure with lead shielding is negligible. Gonadal shielding is dissuaded for the following reasons: Note: as this is a relatively new insight, some of the images in this article do still include lead shielding.
Pathology:
Transient synovitis. The left hip shows a joint effusion (arrow) in the anterior recess which causes separation of the layers of the capsule which are now easily recognized
Transient synovitis:
Transient synovitis - also known as coxitis fugax - is an aseptic inflammation of the hip, presumably of postviral etiology. Affected children are only mildly ill or have recently sustained a low grade respiratory tract infection. The condition is self-limiting and treated with rest and analgesics. It is the most common cause of hip pain or a limp in children under the age of ten years. Imaging is not strictly necessary, but an ultrasound is often requested to confirm the presence of a joint effusion. Radiography is only performed when there are other differential diagnostic considerations. Do not suggest the presence of an effusion on radiographs, as widening of the joint space is a non-specific finding. Always consider the possibility of septic arthritis in a sick child! The appearance of the effusion on ultrasound is not helpful for the differential diagnosis.
Perthes disease:
Perthes disease, also known as Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, is an idiopathic avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis. It occurs more commonly in boys, typically between 5 and 8 years of age, but may range from the ages 3-12. It can occur bilaterally, but it is usually asymmetric. Early radiographs may be normal or show subtle flattening of the femoral head. Sclerosis and subchondral fractures may develop, features best appreciated on the frog-leg lateral view. The images show Perthes disease of the right hip in a five-year old boy. The findings are: Early on in the disease radiographs may be negative, but MRI will show edema in the femoral head with loss of high bone marrow signal on T1-weighted images. Sometimes a radiographically occult fracture can be detected on MRI as a double rim sign on T2-weighted images with fatsat. Joint effusion may be present. Cartilage may become hypertrophic on the affected side. The images show right-sided Perthes disease in a nine-year old girl. There is loss of T1 high signal of the fatty marrow due to edema and sclerosis. Treatment is symptomatic. Depending on whether or not there is spontaneous revascularization, the disease may or may not progress. In disease progression, fragmentation and collapse of the femoral head will occur. Metaphyseal lucencies can be seen. In the healing phase, Perthes disease can lead to a short, broad femoral head and collum. This is also known as coxa magna deformity. Surgical reconstruction (Salter osteotomy) may be required to prevent early osteoarthritis. The images show: The radiologic differential diagnosis of Perthes disease includes: Secondary avascular necrosis Perthes disease has to be differentiated from avascular necrosis with a known cause, as this may require a different treatment approach. Causes of avascular necrosis include: The x-ray is of a 15-year old with acute lymphatic leukemia who was treated with steroids. The images alone cannot differentiate from Perthes disease, but based on the clinical information, this is secondary avascular necrosis. Meyer's dysplasia This is an uncommon condition in which the femoral heads show delayed ossification and fragmentation, most often occurring bilaterally. Radiographically it cannot be differentiated from Perthes disease. It does not show progressive collapse or deformity over time and is symmetric. It generally occurs in a younger population (2-4 years old). The condition itself is asymptomatic and the joints will develop normally. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia can mimick Perthes disease as it may manifest primarily in the hips. It is a rare hereditary skeletal dysplasia. Patients present with a waddling gait, pain, fatigue and short stature. Contrary to Perthes disease, the abnormalities are usually symmetric. The knees, ankles and wrists are usually also involved. Endochondral ossification is abnormal and results in small, fragmented epiphyses with alignment abnormalities. Radiographs of all joints are required to establish the diagnosis. Patients will develop premature osteoarthritis. The treatment is symptomatic. Slipped epiphysis in a thirteen-year old boy. AP radiograph shows a slightly widened epiphysis, but this can easily be overlooked. The frog-leg lateral view shows a medio-posterior slippage of the left femoral epiphysis.
Slipped Capital Femoral Eiphysis:
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) or femoral epiphysiolysis is an idiopathic Salter-Harris type I fracture of the proximal femoral epiphysis. It occurs more commonly in boys and in obese children. The typical age at presentation is between 12-15 years. SCFE may occur bilaterally in up to one third of cases. The epiphysis slips posteriorly, and to a lesser extent medially. It is therefore best appreciated on the frog-leg lateral view. SCFE is treated with surgical fixation to prevent further slippage. Avascular necrosis of the femoral epiphysis is a potential complication. JIA: Effusion of the right hip in JIA. The synovium is thickened and loads Gadolineum contrast (right).

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a clinical diagnosis and is currently divided into six different subtypes. In most cases, less than 4 joints are involved. Large joints are mainly affected, including the hips. JIA begins with a tenosynovitis and only later shows bone edema, periostitis, osteoporosis and growth disturbances. Contrary to the adult population, cartilage loss and erosions are not a frequent finding in JIA. X-rays are usually negative early on in the disease. Typical findings in later stages of the disease may be a slightly larger epiphysis, or accelerated bone maturation. Since JIA is treated aggressively early on, radiographic bony changes may remain absent. Ultrasound will show effusion, thickened synovium and sometimes hyperemia. MRI will also demonstrate the joint effusion and synovial thickening, but can also show damage to the bone and cartilage. It is also a great modality for the assessment of resulting growth disturbances.
Osteomyelitis:
Osteomyelitis is a relatively common severe condition in children, occurring most frequently in children under the age of five years. At this young age, the presentation can be rather non-specific, and infants may present only with a fever and failure to thrive. Most cases are hematogenous, and may be a sequela of a respiratory tract infection. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen. 5 week old, sick infant with severe osteomyelitis of the left hip. MRI with Gadolinium contrast shows extensive soft tissue involvement and periosteal reaction. Most radiographs will not show abnormalities in the early stages of the disease, but after 7-10 days there may be lytic changes and periosteal reactions. Ultrasound can be helpful in the diagnosis in cases with subperiosteal abscess formation. In suspected osteomyelitis, MRI is the imaging method of choice. In infants or young children in whom the location may be uncertain, bone scintigraphy can be useful. Both MRI and bone scintigraphy show abnormalities in the early stages of the disease. On MRI osteomyelitis appears as an area of T2 increased signal in the metaphysis with enhancement and surrounding edema in the soft tissues, and occasionally a subperiosteal abscess. In infants and children with closed growth plates, the growth plate does not act as a barrier and infection may spread to the epiphysis and joint. . At four months follow-up a residual, but less prominent periosteal reaction is present and there is accelerated bone maturation. In osteomyelitis bone scintigraphy will show an area of increased uptake. Osteomyelitis is treated with i.v. antibiotics and has a good prognosis if detected promptly. Brodie's abscess A subtype of osteomyelitis which is typically seen in children is a Brodie's abscess. It is a subacute osteomyelitis with intraosseous abscess formation. The only complaint can be pain. Fever and inflammatory markers may be absent. The abscess is usually located in the metaphysis of long bones, but may be located in the epiphysis in young children. On x-ray there is a sharp defined oval lytic lesion with or without a sclerotic rim, with its long axis parallel to the long axis of the bone (see figure). On MRI the lesion is hyperintense on T2WI. There is joint effusion and only minimal edema in the surrounding musculature. Five-year old boy with a limp and fever at presentation. Ultrasound was difficult because the boy was unable to stretch his leg, but the left hip clearly shows an effusion and synovial thickening. Pus was evacuated in the operating theater.
Septic arthritis:
Septic arthritis is a surgical emergency. The inflammation of a joint in septic arthritis is bacterial and, as in osteomyelitis, is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Septic arthritis can have a rapidly deteriorating course with destruction of the joint. Affected children are ill, with fever and severe joint pain. On ultrasound there is joint effusion (as previously mentioned, the echogenicity is not of diagnostic value). The synovium may be thickened, but this is a non-specific finding also found in other inflammatory pathology such as JIA. The clinical profile, laboratory findings and the presence of a joint effusion are suggestive of septic arthritis. Subsequent aspiration of pus confirms the diagnosis. Surgical debridement should take place as soon as possible. Radiographs are not sensitive to joint effusion and are not helpful in the early diagnosis. Nevertheless, they should be acquired for follow-up purposes. Joint space narrowing and osteolysis will become visible in later stages of the disease. MRI may be helpful to assess the extent of disease and can detect possible concomitant osteomyelitis. *NOTE: Absence of joint effusion excludes septic arthritis.*
Avulsion injuries:
Avulsion injuries of the pelvis are a frequent cause of hip pain in adolescents involved in sports. Because at this age the tendons are generally stronger than the apophyses, strong muscle contraction can result in apophyseal avulsion fractures. Avulsion injuries can be acute or chronic. Typical avulsion injury of the anterior inferior iliac spine at the insertion of the rectus femoris tendon. Typical avulsion injury of the right ischial aphophysis. Osteoid osteoma
Bone tumors and tumor-like lesions:
There are many bone tumors and tumor-like lesions that may cause pain in the hip or upper leg. We will not discuss the various bone tumors here, but osteoid osteoma must be addressed, since it is a relatively common tumor, and the cortex of the femoral neck a common location. Osteoid osteoma is a benign tumor characterized by an extensive bony reaction and severe bone pain, occurring mainly at night. X-ray imaging shows a small oval lytic lesion which may be obscured by the dense, bony reaction surrounding it. MRI shows the nidus. Eosinophilic granuloma Other bone tumors and tumor-like lesions such as eosinophilic granuloma may also be the underlying cause of a painful hip. Periosteal reaction of the fibula in a fibular Toddler's fracture.
Knee and foot:
As mentioned previously, young children may have difficulty communicating the cause of their pain or limp. In such cases it is wise to analyze their gait and image the entire extremity. A toddler's fracture (image) may be one of the possible underlying causes. Corner fractures in a case of child abuse Corner- or bucket handle fractures should raise the suspicion of non-accidental injury (NAI)
See section on child abuse. In 524 children analyzed for hip pain we found three cases of mesenteric adenitis. In some atypical situations an abdominal ultrasound may therefore be of value. by Bomer J, Klerx-Melis F, Holscher HC. Eur Radiol 2014 24(3):703-8.

Elbow fractures in Children.:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology department, Rijnland Hospital Leiderdorp, the Netherlands.:
Publicationdate 2008-12-01 Elbow fractures are the most common fractures in children. The assessment of the elbow can be difficult because of the changing anatomy of the growing skeleton and the subtility of some of these fractures. In this review important signs of fractures and dislocations of the elbow will be discussed. Before reading this article you can try one of the cases in the menubar.

Injury to the elbow joint is usely the result of hyperextension or extreme valgus due to a fall on the outstretched arm. Scroll through the images on the left to see how hyperextension leads to a supracondylar fracture. The hemarthros will result in a displacement of the anterior fat pad upwards and the posterior fat backwards. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images.
Extreme valgus:
The other important fracture mechanism is extreme valgus of the elbow. The normal elbow already has a valgus positioning. When a child falls on the outstrechted arm, this can lead to extreme valgus. On the lateral side this can result in a dislocation or a fracture of the radius with or without involvement of the olecranon. When the forces have more effect on the humerus, the extreme valgus will result in a fracture of the lateral condyle. On the medial side the valgus force can lead to avulsion of the medial epicondyle. Sometimes the medial epicondyl becomes trapped within the joint. Because of the valgus position of the normal elbow an avulsion of the lateral epicondyle will be uncommon.
Radiological Interpretation:

Methodical review:
When looking at radiographs of the elbow after trauma a methodical review of the radiographs is needed . You should ask yourself the following important questions. Is there a sign of joint effusion? After trauma this almost always indicates the presence of hemarthros due to a fracture (either visible or occult). Is there a normal alignment between the bones? In children dislocations are frequent and can be very subtle. Are the ossification centres normal? Is the piece of bone that you're looking at a normal ossification centre and is this ossification centre in the normal position. . Look especially for the position of the radial epiphysis and the medial epicondyle (figure). Is there a subtle fracture? Some of the fractures in children are very subtle. 
So you need to be familiar with the typical picture of these fractures. . Normal anterior fat pad.
Fat Pad Sign and Joint effusion:
Normally on a lateral view of the elbow flexed in 90? a fat pad is seen on the anterior aspect of the joint . This is normal fat located in the joint capsule. On the posterior side no fat pad is seen since the posterior fat is located within the deep intercondylar fossa. Positive fat pad sign both anteriorly as well as posteriorly. Positive fat pad sign Distention of the joint will cause the anterior fat pad to become elevated and the posterior fat pad to become visible. An elevated anterior lucency or a visible posterior lucency on a true lateral radiograph of an elbow flexed at 90? is described as a positive fat pad sign (figure). Hemarthros results in an upward displacement of the anterior fat pad and a backward displacement the posterior fat. Positive Anterior Fat Pad sign. On digital radiographs you may need to adjust the window width and level to appreciate this. No fracture was visible on the X-rays. Positive fat pad sign (2)
Any elbow joint distention either hemorrhagic, inflammatory or traumatic gives rise to a positive fat pad sign. If a positive fat pad sign is not present in a child, significant intra-articular injury is unlikely. A visible fat pad sign without the demonstration of a fracture should be regarded as an occult fracture. These patients are treated as having a nondisplaced fracture with 2 weeks splinting. Skaggs et al repeated x-rays after three weeks in patients with a positive posterior fat pad sign but no visible fracture. They found evidence of fracture in 75%. They concluded that in trauma displacement of the posterior fat pad is virtually pathognomonic of the presence of a fracture. Displacement of the anterior fat pad alone however can occur due to minimal joint effusion and is less specific for fracture. Notice that the elbow is not positioned well. Try to find out what went wrong in the chapter on positioning.
Alignment:
There are two important lines which help in the diagnosis of dislocation and fracture . These are the Radiocapitellar line and the Anterior humeral line. Radiocapitellar line
A line drawn through the centre of the radial neck should pass throught the centre of the capitellum, whatever the positioning of the patient, since the radius articulates with the capitellum (figure). In dislocation of the radius this line will not pass through the centre of the capitellum. On the left we see, that the radiocapitellar line goes through centre of the capitellum on every radiogragh even though C and D are not well positioned. Notice supracondylar fracture in B. On the left more examples of the radiocapitellar line. The right lower image shows an obvious dislocation of the radius. Radiographs of elbows at different ages. The Anterior Humeral line goes through the middle third of the capitellum . Anterior humeral line. A line drawn on a lateral view along the anterior surface of the humerus should pass through the middle third of the capitellum.. This line is called the Anterior Humeral line . In cases of a supracondylar fracture the anterior humeral line usually passes through the anterior third
of the capitellum or in front of the capitellum due to posterior bending of the distal humeral fragment. On the left the anterior humeral line passes through the anterior third of the capitellum. This indicates that the condyles are displaced dorsally (i.e. supracondylar fracture). First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The radiocapitellar line ends above the capitellum. This means that the radius is dislocated. Did you also notice the olecranon fracture? Whenever the radius is fractured or dislocated, always study the ulna carefully. The order of appearance of the ossification centres is specified in the mnemonic C-R-I-T-O-E.
Ossification centres:
There are 6 ossification centres around the elbow joint.
 They appear and fuse to the adjacent bones at different ages. It is important to know the sequence of appearance since the ossification centers always appear in a strict order. This order of appearance is specified in the mnemonic C-R-I-T-O-E
(Capitellum - Radius - Internal or medial epicondyle - Trochlea - Olecranon - External or lateral epicondyle). The ages at which these ossification centres appear are highly variable and differ between individuals. It is not important to know these ages, but as a general guide you could remember 1-3-5-7-9-11 years. Fragmented appearance of the Trochlea in 2 different children. The Trochlea has two or more ossification centres which can give the trochlea a fragmented appearance. Trochlea ossification-fragments simulate loose bodies in the joint On a lateral view the trochlea ossifications may project into the joint. They should not be mistaken for loose intra-articular bodies (arrow).
Radiography:
Shoulder higher than elbow. Radius and Capitellum project on to the ulna.
Common errors in positioning:
Error 1: Shoulder higher than elbow For a true lateral view the shoulder should be at the level of the elbow. If the shoulder is higher than the elbow, the radius and capitellum will project on the ulna. The solution is either to lift the examination table which will lift the elbow or to lower the shoulder by placing the patient on a smaller chair. LEFT: Slight endorotation of the humerus due to a low position of the wrist. RIGHT: More endorotation due to malpositioning. Error 2: Wrist lower than elbow On the left two examples of a 'low wrist positioning' leading to rotation of the humerus. The low position of the wrist leads to endorotation of the humerus. The lateral structures like the capitellum and the radius will move anteriorly, while a medial structure like the medial epicondyle will move posteriorly. The wrist should be higher than the elbow to compensate for the normal valgus position of the elbow. The hand should be with the 'thumb up'.
Elbow fractures:

Supracondylar fractures:
These fractures account for more than 60% of all elbow fractures in children (see Table). More than 95% of supracondylar fractures are hyperextension type due to a fall on the outstretched hand. 
The elbow becomes locked in hyperextension. 
The olecranon is pushed into the olecranon fossa causing the anterior humeral cortex to bend and eventually break. 
If the force continues both the anterior and posterior cortex will fracture. Supracondylar fractures. In A the anterior humeral line passes through the anterior third of the capitellum and in B even more anteriorly. Notice positive posterior fat pad sign in both cases Supracondylar fractures (2)
If there is only minimal or no displacement these fractures can be occult on radiographs. 
The only sign will be a positive fat pad sign. 
Usually there is some displacement and the anterior humeral line will not pass through the centre of the capitellum but through the anterior third or even anterior to the capitellum (figure). Supracondylar fractures (3)
Supracondylar fractures are classified according to Gartland.
Gartland Type I fractures are often difficult to see on X-rays since there is only minimal displacement. 
Most of these fractures consist of greenstick or torus fractures. The only clue to the diagnosis may be a positive fat pad sign. 
These patients are treated with casting. In Gartland type II fractures there is displacement but the posterior cortex is intact. 
There may be some rotation. These fractures require closed reduction and some need percutaneous fixation if a long-arm cast does not adequately hold the reduction. Gartland type III fracture Gartland type III fractures are completely dislocated and are at risk for malunion and neurovascular complications (figure). They require reduction by closed or if necessary open means. Stabilisation is maintained with either two lateral pins or medial lateral cross pin technique. Gartland III fracture with medial-lateral cross pin technique. After reduction there is inadequate correction of medial collaps. After two months there is malunion with cubitus varus deformity. Supracondylar fractures (4)
Malunion will result in the classic 'gunstock' deformity due to rotation or inadequate correction of medial collaps. Posterolateral displacement of the distal fragment can be associated with injurie to the neurovascular bundle which is displaced over the medial metaphyseal spike. Nerve injurie almost always results in neuropraxis that resolves in 3-4 months. Vascular injurie usually results in a pulseless but pink hand. 
Conservative management and vascular intervention have the same outcome. 
A pulseless and white hand after reduction needs exploration. Flexion-type supracondylar fracture caused by direkt impact Supracondylar fractures (5) Flexion-type fractures are uncommon (5% of all supracondylar fractures). 
They are caused by direct impact on the flexed elbow.
 Ulnar nerve injury is more common. 
Compared to extension types, they are more likely to be unstable, so more likely to require fixation.
Lateral Condyle fractures:
This fracture is the second most common distal humerus fracture in children. They occur between the ages of 4 and 10 years. These fractures occur when a varus force is applied to the extended elbow. They tend to be unstable and become displaced because of the pull of the forearm extensors. Since these fractures are intra-articular they are prone to nonunion because the fracture is bathed in synovial fluid. Lateral condyle fractures are classified according to Milch. They are Salter-Harris IV epiphysiolysis fractures. Most are Milch II fractures that travel from the lateral humeral metaphysis above the epiphysis and exit through the lateral crista of the trochlea leading to an unstable humeral ulnar articulation. Lateral Condyle fractures (2) The problem with the Milch-classification is the fact that the fracture fragments are primarily cartilaginous. The fracture line through the cartilage is not visible on radiographs, so the radiographic interpretation concerning classification is difficult.
Treatment strategies are therefore based on the amount of displacement (see Table). Undisplaced fractures are treated with a long arm cast.
These fractures must be carefully monitored as they have a tendency to displace. At follow up both AP and Oblique views are taken after removal of the cast. 
Once displaced fractures consolidate in a malunited position, treatment is difficult and fraught with complications.
For this reason surgical reductions is recommended within the first 48 hours. Open reduction is indicated for all displaced fractures and those demonstrating joint instability. Lateral Condyle fractures (3) .
The diagnosis of a lateral condyle fracture can be challenging. Fracture lines are sometimes barely visible (figure). Remembering the fact that the lateral condyle fracture is the second most common elbow-fracture in children and because you know where to look for will help you Lateral condyle fracture. On the x-ray only a small metaphyseal fragment is visible. The detatched fragment however is larger than it appears on the radiograph. The fracture extents into the lateral ridge of the trochlea. Elbow is probably unstable. Lateral Condyle fractures (4) . Since most of the structures involved are cartilageneous, it is very difficult to know the exact extent of the fracture. CT reconstruction of displaced lateral condyle fracture. Humeroulnar joint is stable. Sometimes the fracture runs through the ossified part of the capitellum. In those cases it is easy. The case on the left shows a lateral condyle fracture extending through the ossified part of the capitellum. This is a Milch I fracture. The elbow is stable. 
There is too much displacement so osteosynthesis has to be performed. MR of lateral condyle fracture. Milch II and unstable elbow. T2 image with fat saturation on the right shows cartilaginous fracture. Fracture-fragment surrounded by synovial fluid. (Courtesy of Lynne Steinbach, M.D. Univ. of California, San Francisco) MRI can be helpfull in depicting the full extent of the cartilaginous component of the fracture. The case on the left shows a fracture extending into the unossified trochlear ridge. The fracture through the trochlear cartilage is so far medial that the ulna is only supported on the medial side. This means that the elbowjoint is unstable. LEFT a subtle lateral condyle fracture. Less than 2 mm displacement and probably stable. RIGHT a different case. Oblique view gives nice impression of fracture. Blue arrow indicates a cleft epiphysis of the radius (normal variant) Lateral Condyle fractures (5) 
In lateral condyle fractures the actual fracture line can be very subtle since the metaphyseal flake of bone may be minor. The fracture fragment is often rotated. An oblique view can be helpfull, but usually these are not routinely performed (figure). Two cases of overprojection of the capitellum on humeral epiphysis simulating a fracture. Notice olecranon fracture on the right Lateral Condyle fractures (6) . Overprojection of the capitellum on the humeral metaphysis may simulate a lateral condyle fracture (figure). Lateral Condyle fractures (7) . On the left a couple of examples of lateral condyle fractures. Capitellum fracture While fractures of the lateral condyle occur in children between the age of 4 -10 years, isolated fractures of the capitellum are seen in children above the age of 12. Capitellum fractures are uncommon. The rotation of the fracture fragment gives a typical appearance on the X-rays (arrow). Normal medial epicondyle projecting posteriorly. Notice radial head dislocation and olecranon fracture
Medial Epicondyle avulsion:
The medial epicondyle is an apophysis since it does not contribute to the longitudinal growth of the humerus. 
It is located on the dorsal side of the elbow. On a lateral view especially if the arm is endorotated it can project so far posteriorly that one could suggest an avulsion (figure). However avulsions are located more distally and anteriorly. Since the medial epicondyle is an extra-articular structure a fracture or avulsion will not automatically produce a positive fat pad sign. Avulsion of medial epicondyle. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (2). 80% of avulsion fractures occur in boys with a peak age in early adolescence. The mechanism is an acute valgus stress due to a fall on the outstretched hand or sometimes due to armwrestling. Chronic injuries do occur in young athletes (little league elbow). The mechanism that causes these stressfractures on the medial side is the same mechanism that causes a osteochondritis of the capitellum due to impaction on the lateral side. Dislocation of the elbow with interposed medial epicondyle. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (3). There is a 50% incidence of associated elbow dislocations. 
When the elbow is dislocated and the medial epicondyle is avulsed,
 it may become interposed between the articular surface of the humerus and the olecranon (figure). In every dislocation the first question should be 'where is the medial epicondyle'. Same case as above. After reduction the epicondyle returned to its normal position (not good visible due to cast) and was fixated with K-wires. On reducing the elbow the fragment may return to it's original position or remain trapped in the joint. 
This may severely damage the articular surface. So post-reduction films should be studied carefully. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (4). Due to the extreme valgus force the joint may temporarily open. 
The avulsed fragment may become entrapped in the joint even when there is no dislocation of the elbow. On AP-view the avulsed medial epicondyle projects over the trochlea. Lateral view shows the fragment to be trapped within the joint. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (5).
An avulsed fragment that is located within the joint can give diagnostic problems. On an AP-view this fragment may be overlooked (figure). When the trochlea is not yet ossified the avulsed fragment may simulate a trochlear ossification centre. Another example of a dislocated elbow with avulsion of the medial epicondyle. In this case the epicondyle is not retracted into the joint. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (6). Treatment Non-displaced fractures are treated with 1-2 weeks cast or splint. 
There is disagreement about the amount of displacement of the medial epicondyle that requires operative fixation. There is support for both operative aswell as non-operative management of medial epicondyle fractures with 5-15mm displacement. Avulsion of the medial epicondyle. The amount of soft tissue swelling on the medial side suggests that the elbow was dislocated. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (7). If the history or the radiographs suggest that the elbow was or is dislocated, greater soft tissue injurie is likely to be present requiring need for early motion.

Study the images. You can click on the image to enlarge. There are three findings, that you should comment on. Click on the image to enlarge Continue with the MRI. Click on the image to enlarge The MR shows the small medial epicondyle with tendon attachement trapped within the joint. The avulsed medial epicondyl was found within the joint and repositioned and fixated with K-wires. Subtle radial neck fracture seen only on AP-view.
Proximal fractures of the Radius:
In adults fractures usually involve the articular surface of the radial head.
 In children however it's the radial neck that fractures because the metaphyseal bone is weak due to constant remodelling. 
Usually it is a Salter Harris II fracture. If there is no displacement it can be difficult to make the diagnosis (figure). Radial neck fracture with tilt. Notice trochlear ossifications projecting in between humerus and ulna simulating intra-articular fragments. If there is less than 30? tilt of the radial head patients are treated with a collar. 
It is important to realize that there is normally some angulation of the radial head ( up to 15?). If there is more than 30? tilt closed reduction is performed. After closed reduction radiograph in cast shows unsuccesfull reduction. K-wire insertion is performed Whenever closed reduction is unsuccesfull in restoring tilt or when it is not possible to pronate and supinate up to 60?, a K-wire is inserted to maintain reduction. The radial epiphysis is slipped (arrows). The radiocapitellar line does not pass through the capitellum indicating dislocation and there is a fracture of the olecranon Radial neck fractures aswell as radial head dislocations are in 50% of the cases associated with other elbow injuries. 
The most common is a fracture of the olecranon. When the radial epiphysis is yet very small a slipped radial epiphysis may be overlooked (figure). Same patient as above 4 weeks later If these fractures are not recognized or reduction is unsuccesfull radial head overgrowth can be the result. A short radius may also be the result since the epiphysis of the radius contributes to the length growth of the radius. LEFT: an obvious radial dislocation. No fracture of the ulna (Monteggia) was foundRIGHT: a subtle radial head dislocation. Associated olecranonfracture is seen on carefull inspection
Dislocations of the Radial head:
Dislocations of the radial head can be very obvious.
 It is however not uncommon that these dislocations are subtle and easily overlooked. In all cases one should look for associated injury. 
In the original discription of Monteggia there is a radial dislocation in combination with a proximal ulnar shaft fracture. 
However fractures anywhere along the ulna have been reported. 
Especially associated fractures of the olecranon are very common (figure). Radius Pulled Elbow (Nursemaid's elbow) In children When the forearm is pulled the radial head moves distally and the ligament slips over the radial head and becomes trapped within the joint. The X-ray is normal. The condition is cured by supination of the forearm. Sometimes this happens during positioning for a true lateral view (which is with the forearm in supination). Olecranon fracture indicated by discontinuity of the dorsal cortex. No associated fracture.
Olecranon fractures:
Olecranon fractures in children are less common than in adults. As discussed above they are associated with radial neck fractures and radial dislocations. Normal olecranon ossification centres in a patient with a tilted radial neck fracture. Olecranon fractures (2) Do not mistake the apophysis or its separate ossification centres for a fracture. 
The apophysis has undulating faintly sclerotic margins. 
The growth plate usually has a different oblique course compared to a fracture-line. Olecranon fractures (3) On the left some examples of fractures of the olecranon. Notice how subtle some of these fractures are.

Acute Abdomen in Gynaecology - Ultrasound:
Julien Puylaert
Amsterdam UMC and Haaglanden MC, The Hague:
Publicationdate 01-01-2022 This is a pictorial essay
of the various gynaecological conditions
that may cause acute abdominal pain, as far as they are encountered in daily radiological
practice. Conditions which present
during a known pregnancy like
miscarriage, early ectopic pregnancy, uterine rupture and placental abruption, as well as puerperal endometritis,
are not included as they belong to the professional terrain
of the gynaecologist.
These conditions are rarely seen in the daily radiological practice of acute
abdomen. For critical
comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com
Introduction:
This table summarizes the gynaecological diseases that may present
with acute abdominal pain. It is divided into pathology in:
Normal US anatomy:
Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Uterus and ovaries are best visualized with the bladder
half-full. A very full bladder is unpleasant
for the patient, hampers adequate compression and pushes organs away from the ventral
abdominal wall, excluding the use of high frequency probes. In the sagittal view the uterus, cervix, vagina, anorectum
and urethra (u.) can be identified, as well as the collapsed anterior and
posterior fornix of the vagina. Studying a uterus, which is in retroflexion, requires more
bladder filling. Transverse view allows visualization of both uterus
and ovaries. The uterus itself may also provide
an acoustic window to visualize the ovaries. With the uterus in anteflexion, the ovaries are quite
ventrally localized and can often be visualized using the right and left iliac vessels as an acoustic window (figure).
Dominant follicle:
In women of the fertile age the normal inactive
ovaries show moderate vascularization (left image). During the pre-ovulatory phase the dominant follicle
can be identified by its “ring-of-fire” (right image).
Luteal body:
After the ovulation the dominant follicle becomes smaller
(left) and in the absence of pregnancy, turns into a crenulated luteal body (right). Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) has great advantages in
visualizing the uterus and ovaries. It can also be used for non-gynaecological
conditions such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, etc. The use of transvaginal ultrasound will be dealt with in a
different article: TVUS for non-gynaecological conditions.
Acute gynaecological conditions in pregnancy:

Ectopic pregnancy:

In:
this young woman, US demonstrated a large quantity of clotted (C.) and liquified
blood (*) around the uterus, suspect for ectopic pregnancy. However,  β-HCG levels in both urine and serum were extremely
low. US
guided puncture in the liquified part confirmed blood. (bl. = bladder) Laparoscopy
revealed severe bleeding from a luteal body, which was successfully coagulated. ischemic myoma in pregnancy
Ischemic myoma:
During
pregnancy a myoma may increase in size and outgrow its vascularization. case 1 This 25
year old pregnant woman presented with a palpable, painful mass in the
RLQ, suspect for an “appendiceal mass”. US revealed
a hypoechoic, inhomogeneous, hypovascular round solid mass arising from the myometrium,
and “bulging” into the abdominal wall during compression. The
diagnosis was an ischemic myoma. 
She was successfully treated
with analgesics. 
Labor inhibitors were not
necessary. Necrotic myoma in pregnancy case 2 Here another case of an ischemic myoma.
The extrinsic location in this case suggests that this is a
pedunculated myoma (arrowheads). This patient was successfully treated with analgesics and labor inhibitors. Torsion of luteal cyst in early pregnancy
Torsion of enlarged adnex:
case 1 Young
female with acute onset of RLQ pain. US
reveals a large mass filled with hypoechoic sebum, harbouring a hyperechoic hairball
(arrow) surrounded by multiple tiny  linear
hair reflections. CT confirms
a dermoid cyst containing  a hairball
(arrow) and surrounded by fat stranding, caused by venous congestion. 
At surgery
torsion of a dermoid cyst was confirmed. Torsion of hydrosalpinx. case 2 A 40
year old lady presented with acute RLQ pain. 
CT revealed a dilated, fluid-filled
salpinx. Additional
US showed that the salpinx was under tense pressure and “bulged” into the
abdominal wall during compression (arrows). An
ischemic, twisted hydrosalpinx was found and laparoscopically removed. Torsion of large dermoid cyst, missed by gynaecological TVUS. (h. = hairball) case 3 In this 45-year old woman with acute lower abdominal pain, TVUS was negative.  
Subsequent transabdominal US showed a large dermoid (arrowheads) in a fairly high location.
CT confirmed the diagnosis.
At surgery a twisted dermoid cyst was found. Endometriosis: chocolate cysts and “kissing ovaries”.
Acute conditions in non-Pregnant women:
Persistent haemorrhagic cyst.
Persistent or hemorrhagic cyst.:
In young
women with acute abdominal pain, an enlarged
cystic adnex with or without some free fluid, is a frequent finding. In most cases, this is
a functional cyst, which has ruptured or has been bleeding.
Lab findings are
usually normal with a low CRP and the US
abnormalities disappear within days or weeks. case 1
In this young woman a large partly cystic mass was found with a solid, avascular component (clot).
CRP remained low and the pain was gone in two days.
Follow up US after 6 weeks showed complete normalization. It is important to realize that these US findings may
also be completely asymptomatic. Persistent haemorrhagic cyst. case 2
In this young woman with two days of RLQ pain and a
CRP of 2, a right-sided, thin-walled ovarian cyst was found at US. TVUS shows the typical, very thin, lace-like septations
and also the residual normal, follicle-containing ovary “squeezed” to the side
by the haemorrhagic cyst. 
Complete resolution after 6 weeks. Ruptured follicle. (ut = uterus) case 3
These images are of a woman of 17 years old with acute, severe RLQ  pain. CRP 1. US reveals an ill-defined thick-walled
right ovarian cyst and free fluid (*) in Douglas pouch. TVUS confirms the fluid and a partially collapsed,
easily compressible cyst in the right ovary. 
The left ovary is normal (right lower
image). The pain gradually decreased and lab-findings remained normal. 
Within one week there was complete
normalization of the US findings. The most likely diagnosis: ruptured
functional cyst. ov-cyst-funct.jpg) Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Well-compressible, haemorrhagic cyst ov-cyst-funct.jpg) Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Well-compressible, haemorrhagic cyst case 4
This functional, hemorrhagic cyst was a coincidental
finding and could easily be compressed against the promontory (p). Complete resolution of the abnormalities
within two weeks. funct-cyste-zeker-coll.jpg) Haemorrhagic cyst with clot. case 5
Persistent haemorrhagic cysts often contain solid,
avascular, inhomogeneous masses representing clots. Retractility of such clots often results in concave
contours (arrowheads). Pitfall: asymptomatic right ovarian cyst in woman with appendicitis. (V= iliac vein) case 6
In this young woman a conspicuous hemorrhagic right
ovarian cyst (arrowheads) was visualized and initially held responsible
for her RLQ symptoms. Further examination however revealed an acute appendicitis
(arrow).
The cyst was an asymptomatic coincidental finding.
PID:
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is the common denominator
for all ascending infections of cervix, endometrium, ovary and Fallopian tubes and its extension into the peritoneal cavity. The causes are Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and Gram-negative
organisms, but often cultures remain negative, and then the diagnosis is based
on clinical findings and a good effect of antibiotics. PID is often diagnosed and treated on clinical grounds,
however US is often performed to diagnose and stage PID and to exclude alternative
conditions as appendicitis. PID due to Chlamydia infection PID case 1 A 32 year old woman  was treated for suspected cystitis with
antibiotics by the family-doctor. Now submitted with clinically suspected
appendicitis and CRP 190 and WBC 9. US was normal, but of moderate quality due to obesity.
CT showed an 8 mm, but otherwise normal looking appendix (arrow) and bilateral fatty
stranding of the peritoneal fat (arrowheads). The appendix looked “too normal” for a CRP of 190, so
the most likely diagnosis was PID and antibiotics were started. Two days later
the PCR for Chlamydia was positive. PID in the LLQ PID case 2 A young woman with severe pain in the LLQ and a CRP of
530 and a WBC of 22. The only abnormal US finding was some hyperechoic preperitoneal
fat in the LLQ.
CT confirms the US findings. 
Normal appendix and
adnexa (not shown here). The most likely diagnosis was PID.
There was good reaction on antibiotics and no microorganism was found. Early PID. PID case 3 Young woman with acute RLQ pain and a CRP of 140. Abdominal US was completely normal. TVUS showed subtle hyperemia of both tubes and ovaries,
surrounded by hyperechoic, moderately compressible, fatty tissue (*). 
This
represents slightly inflamed peritoneal, mesenterial and omental fatty tissue. CT confirmed a normal appendix (arrows) and subtle diffuse
hyperdensity of the peritoneal, mesenterial and omental fat (*). She quickly
recovered with antibiotics. Cultures and PCR remained negative. gonorr-pid-ov-ut-gb-paral-ileus-coll-2.jpg/a7d94aba0563c0db023a7f24b3844f66.jpg) Paralytic ileus in gonorrhoeic PID. PID case 4 These images are of a very ill, painful young woman with generalized peritonitis
and a CRP of 250, clinically suspect for perforated appendicitis. US showed aperistaltic small bowel (b.).
The appendix
was not visualized. TVUS showed a normal uterus and normal ovaries
(arrowheads), which were surrounded by hyperechoic tissue (*). CT confirmed the paralytic ileus and showed a normal
appendix (arrow). PCR was positive for gonorrhoea. Early PID with secondary thickened appendix. (ut. = uterus, b = small bowel, a and v = iliac artery and vein, s = sigmoid) PID case 5 Young woman presented with RLQ pain and a CRP of 70,
suspect for appendicitis. US showed some turbid fluid in Douglas pouch (*). 
At
the spot of maximum tenderness a compressible appendix (arrow) was seen, surrounded
by a little hyperechoic fat. TVUS shows that the free fluid is turbid, in view of
the high CRP probably pus. 
The ovaries had a normal aspect, but were surrounded
by hyperechoic, inflamed fat. Diagnosis:
Early PID with minimal secondary reaction
of peritoneum and appendix. 
One day later the PCR for Chlamydia was positive. PID with secondarily thickened appendix. PID case 6 A 29-year old woman presented with suspected appendicitis.
TVUS showed turbid fluid (*) in Douglas pouch, in combination with a CRP of
230, indicating pus. The appendix (arrow) was small, but surrounded by
hyperechoic fat. In view of the high CRP, it was decided that this was a case
of PID with mild (secondary) inflammation of the appendix, rather than a case
of appendicitis. The patient was not operated, and responded well on
antibiotics. Key to avoid an unnecessary appendectomy in these
cases, is to note the discrepancy between the relatively mild inflammation of the
appendix and the high CRP. Confusing peri-appendicitis in PID, leading to unnecessary appendectomy. PID case 7 Ill young lady with suspected appendicitis, CRP 63, WBC
17. 
The next day CRP was 400. US showed a 8 mm appendix (arrows) and diffuse hyperechoic
fat in between hypoechoic tissue. 
The ovaries were not well visualized. CT confirmed a 9 mm appendix (arrows) and diffuse fat
stranding of the ventral fatty tissue (*). 
Normal size and aspect of the ovaries
(not shown here). At diagnostic laparoscopy a purulent peritonitis was
found and an abnormal appendix with fibrinous exudate was removed. 
The pathological
specimen showed only peri-appendicitis, not primary appendicitis. The day after the operation the PCR of the cervix was
positive for Chlamydia. Pitfall: Omental infarction mimicking PID.
Omental infarction mimicking PID:
A young woman presented with isolated pain in the RUQ and an elevated
CRP. The only abnormality at US and CT was a cake-like, rather
outlined area of fat stranding adjacent to the ventral abdominal wall in the RUQ,
 just above the level of
the umbilicus. The shape and  typical location strongly plead for segmental omental
infarction rather than PID. Pitfall: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) mimicking PID.
Familial Mediterranean Fever:
A 27-year old woman had a history of two episodes of
severe LLQ respectively RLQ pain, with a high CRP. She had no fever. US was normal, but CT showed diffuse fatty preperitoneal
stranding (*). 
Both times she was diagnosed  with PID and treated with antibiotics. 
Symptoms
disappeared, and cultures remained negative. In view of her Turkish background, the third time the
diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever was suggested, and eventually genetically proved. 
She had no relatives
with FMF, but her parents were cousins. No more attacks after colchicin. fitz-hugh-curtis-coll2.jpg/355e8a09daed4df40bb3142d57bc3440.jpg) Fitz-Hugh-Curtis (FHC) with secondary thickening of the appendix.
Fitz-Hugh-Curtis:
case 1 Young,
ill lady with severe RUQ pain and an elevated CRP, clinically suspect for cholecystitis
or perforated appendicitis. US
shows a relatively high localization of an 8 mm appendix, which is well-compressible
(arrowheads), surrounded by some hyperechoic fat and clearly not responsible for
her clinical symptoms and lab findings. Higher
up there is some free fluid and hyperechoic fat (arrows) around the tip of the
right liver lobe. No other abnormalities were found, especially normal aspect
of uterus and ovaries. PCR
tests of cervix and urethra, one day later were positive for Chlamydia. Diagnosis: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis (FHC). FHC is also named “perihepatitis” and is in fact a sort
of “PID in the RUQ”, where the infection from the right Fallopian tube spreads directly
to the perihepatic space. Late
sequelae of FHC are the well-known “violin string” adhesions between liver and
abdominal wall at laparoscopy. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis (FHC) case 2 A
29-year old woman presents with progressive pain in the RUQ during a week,
radiating to her right shoulder. The family doctor determined her CRP, which
was 145. US
showed a little perihepatic fluid (arrows) and some fatty infiltration right of
the umbilicus (**). CT confirms
the US findings. CA-125 was elevated (200). The differential diagnosis was FHC,
tuberculous peritonitis or malignant peritonitis. US guided omental biopsy
revealed no malignancy. Two
days later PCR of cervix and urethra was positive for Chlamydia. Complete cure
after antibiotics. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis in patient with coincidental gallstones. case 3 Twenty
year old woman with severe RUQ pain and a high CRP, suspect for acute
cholecystitis. US showed
a compressible, thin-walled gallbladder with multiple stones. This aspect is not
compatible with cholecystitis and does not explain the severe pain and the high
CRP. There was hyperechoic fat between the abdominal wall and the right liver
lobe (arrowheads). CT
confirmed some perihepatic fat stranding (arrowheads) and (secondary) enhancement
of the subcapsular liver parenchyma (arrows), confirming the diagnosis of FHC. One
day later the PCR was positive for Chlamydia. pid-coll.jpg/44d80986fc45369eced905f3ace3cba7.jpg) PID: Right sided oophoritis.
Oophoritis:
case 1 Ill,
young woman with  RLQ  pain and a CRP of 160. 
TVUS shows a hyperemic,
swollen right ovary, with irregularly defined, thick-walled follicles, filled
with debris-like material (pus), surrounded by hyperechoic fat (*). PCR was
positive for Chlamydia the next day. Right-sided oophoritis. case 2 Young woman with acute pain RLQ and a CRP of 75. 
TVUS
shows an irregularly enlarged, inhomogeneous
right ovary with blurred follicles and surrounded by hyperechoic fat (*). The left ovary is slightly hyperaemic, but otherwise
normal. 
There is turbid fluid (f.) in Douglas pouch, representing pus (CRP 75). toa-ecoli-ziek-coll-eng.jpg/e2f13b033254bbb5c0795c8d6f054d0b.jpg) Left sided tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA)
Tubo-ovarian abscess:
TOA case 1 Young,
very ill woman with acute LLQ pain and a CRP of 260. Left of the uterus a massively
enlarged (6 x 7 x 8 cm) ovary is found. 
The individual follicles are enlarged, ill-defined
and filled with turbid fluid (pus). 
Note the hyperechoic halo around this inflamed
mass. Since
there is no apparent involvement of the Fallopian tube, strictly speaking this
is an oophoritis. Nevertheless, usually the term of  tubo-ovarian abscess is used. Bilateral tubo-ovarian abscesses with generalized peritonitis. TOA case 2 Young
woman presenting with severe acute abdominal pain clinically suspect for perforated
appendicitis. 
Lab-findings at admission: WBC 10.6 - CRP 6 Two days later: WBC 19.7 - CRP 459 US  showed a large inhomogeneous masses left and
right of the uterus, suspect for tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). There
was also a paralytic ileus with secondary wall thickening of small bowel (b.) and
hyperechoic preperitoneal and mesenterial fat. 
Puncture of a little ascites yielded
2 cc of yellow, turbid fluid. CT
confirmed the US findings but additionally demonstrated a pyosalpinx (p.)
within the tubo-ovarian mass on the right side. Antibiotics are started intravenously. Two
days later PCR of both cervical and urethral probes as well as the punctured
fluid were positive for Chlamydia. 
Rapid recovery with only antibiotics. Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) containing gas. TOA case 3 Large
left sided TOA with air-configurations.
This is a rare finding in TOA, successful
treatment with only antibiotics. Bilateral infected endometriotic cysts. TOA case 4  (infected endometriotic cysts) These images are of a 29-year old woman, suspected for appendicitis. CRP 185, WBC 17. US shows a normal compressible appendix, thereby excluding appendicitis.
Large, thick-walled, septated cystic structures, filled with debris-like material, were found on both sides of the uterus (ut.), touching each other posteriorly (“kissing ovaries”). 
This is somewhat suspect for bilateral infected endometrotic cysts. The patient was treated with antibiotics and laparoscopic drainage. 
There was a protracted course, but eventually regression of the abnormalities. An MRI six months later, demonstrated all the signs of deep infiltrating endometriosis, also invading the rectum, thereby confirming the diagnosis of endometriosis. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll case 5 - Actinomycosis A
52-year old woman presented with RLQ  pain
for two weeks. US and
subsequent CT, showed a large, right sided iliopsoas abscess (absc.), in continuity
with a TOA, causing hydronephrosis with cortical loss and a dilated ureter (u.). There was an IUD in the uterus, the CRP was 240 and the WBC 26. The
IUD, that had been in place for 30 years, was removed. The abscess was punctured
and later drained percutaneously.  
Gram
stain of the pus showed gram-positive rods, suggestive of actinomycosis, and
i.v. penicillin was started. 
Cultures grew Actinomyces israelii 20 days later. Eventually
there was a complete cure without residual abnormalities. Pyosalpinx
Pyosalpinx:
case 1 these images are of a young
woman with pain in the RLQ for two days and CRP 170 and WBC 14. US respectively
TVUS shows tortuous, thick-walled  tubular
structure right of the uterus (ut.), in combination with the CRP, typical for a
pus-filled Fallopian tube (pyosalpinx). This
patient was successfully treated with antibiotics but had recurrent episodes. 
For this reason she underwent
a tubectomy three years later. Pyosalpinx case 2 Young
lady with pain RLQ since three days. CRP 100 and WBC 23, suspect for appendicitis. US shows
turbid peritoneal fluid and a dilated, thick-walled Fallopian tube,  filled with debris. Complete cure after antibiotics. Pyosalpinx associated with IUD. case 3 Young
woman with acute pain RLQ and a  CRP 180,
suspect for appendicitis. US
confirms a IUD in the uterus and a large, right-sided pyosalpinx. Complete
recovery after antibiotics and removal of the IUD.
Endometriosis:

Endometriosis is endometrium outside the uterus.There are three main types of endometriosis, based on where it is::
case 1
Young
woman with chronic lower abdominal pain and normal lab findings. US
demonstrates two large, thick walled ovarian cysts with homogeneous sludge-like
(“chocolate”) contents behind the uterus. The cysts are fixed to each other (“kissing
ovaries”) and to the uterus. Endometriotic cyst. case 2 Patient
with chronic lower abdominal pain and normal lab. US
shows 5 cm, thick-walled cyst with triangular demarcation from the uterus,
indicating adhesions. At
TVUS the cyst adhered completely to the uterus and during compression with the
vaginal probe, it was not possible to separate the cyst from the uterus.
Enlarged cystic adnex:
In the
majority of women with acute abdominal pain and an enlarged, cystic adnex, the final diagnosis will be an ordinary haemorrhagic,
persistent or ruptured functional cyst.
There will be no other therapy than pain medication
and reassurance. There
are however several other pathological adnex-conditions that do have therapeutic
consequences, and thus should be excluded like endometriotic cyst, dermoid cyst,
a benign or malignant tumor, hydrosalpinx or a tubo-ovarian abscess (see Table). Next
to clinical features and lab findings, US has an important role to differentiate
these conditions from a functional cyst. Therefore in case of relatively mild
symptoms and conservative treatment, a cystic adnex is generally followed up by
US after six weeks. 
If completely disappeared by then, it must have been a
case of a hemorrhagic, persistent or ruptured functional cyst. Ruptured endometriotic cyst case 3 Young

shows that the endometriotic cyst is filled with homogeneous, hyperechoic fluid
(old blood) and is easily compressible (as expected after rupture). Ruptured benign mucinous cystadenoma.
Ruptured cystadenoma.:
case 1 An elderly
lady presented with peracute RLQ pain and leucocytosis. US
and subsequent CT showed a collapsed, multicystic tumour with thick-walled,
hypervascular septa and free fluid (*). 
The bladder (b.) was empty. Surgery

Appendicitis and Mimics:

Alternative nonsurgical diagnoses at sonography and CT:
Adriaan van Breda Vriesman M.D. and Julien Puylaert M.D.
Radiology Department, Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp and Medical Centre Haaglanden, the Hague, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2005-08-14 Introduction In this overview we focus on nonsurgical appendicitis-mimicking diseases. A correct imaging diagnosis prevents an unnecessary operation or costful in-hospital observation. For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com
the Appendix:
Appendicitis with periappendical fat infiltration.Click on the image to enlarge
Normal Appendix:
Sonography and CT allow direct visualization of the normal or inflamed appendix. The normal appendix can be identified in 67-100% of patients without appendicitis who undergo CT [1]. Fig. 1.- 34-year-old healthy volunteer with a normal appendix. A and B, longitudinal (A) and transverse (B) sonogram, showing the appendix (arrowheads) with a diameter less than the 7 mm cut-off point, surrounded by normal noninflamed fat. At sonography the normal appendix is less frequently visualized, with results varying between 0-82% [1], reflecting the operator dependency of sonography. One of the most important imaging criteria in the evaluation of appendicitis is the outer diameter of the appendix. Although an overlap of appendiceal diameters in normal and inflamed appendices has been reported, a threshold value of 6-7 mm is most commonly used [1]. (Fig. 1). Fig. 2. A 50 year old man with a normal appendix. Unenhanced CT shows an air-filled nondistended appendix (arrowhead) with homogeneous periappendiceal fat without fat-stranding. A normal appendix has a maximum outer diameter of 6 mm, is surrounded by homogeneous non-inflamed fat, and often contains intraluminal gas [2] (Fig. 2). Fig. 3. A 19 year old woman with appendicitis. Longitudinal and transverse sonogram show an enlarged appendix (arrows) surrounded by hyperechoic inflamed fat (arrowheads).
Appendicitis:
An inflamed appendix has a diameter larger than 6 mm, and is usually surrounded by hyperechoic inflamed fat at sonography (Fig. 3a). Other strongly supportive signs of inflammation include the presence of an appendicolith, cecal apical thickening Fig. 3b. Power Doppler sonography shows hypervascularity of the appendiceal wall. Another supportive sign for appendicitis is hypervascularity of the appendix wall on color Doppler sonography [1] (Fig. 3b). Fig. 4.- 43-year-old man with appendicitis. Contrast-enhanced CT depicts a fluid-filled distended appendix (arrow) with periappendiceal fat-stranding. At CT the inflamed appendix is surrounded by fat-stranding (Fig. 4).
Gastrointestinal nonsurgical mimics of Appendicitis:
Fig. 5. A 14 year old boy with mesenteric adenitis. Sonogram of the right lower quadrant shows a cluster of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (arrowheads). The appendix was normal (not shown) and no other abnormalities were found.
Mesenteric adenitis:
Mesenteric adenitis has been reported to be the second most common cause of right lower quadrant pain after appendicitis, accounting for 2-14% of the discharge diagnoses in patients with a clinical suspicion of appendicitis [3]. It is defined as a benign self-limiting inflammation of right-sided mesenteric lymph nodes without an identifiable underlying inflammatory process, occurring more often in children than in adults. Sonography and CT show clustered adenopathy (Fig. 5). Fig 6.- 39-year-old man with bacterial ileocecitis. A and B, Sonography shows moderate mural thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum, surrounded by normal noninflamed fat. Moderate mesenteric lymphadenopathy was also present (not shown).
Bacterial ileocecitis:
Because adenopathy also frequently occurs with appendicitis, the normal appendix must be confidently visualized on imaging studies before assigning a diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis. Infectious enterocolitis may cause mild symptoms resembling a common viral gastroenteritis, but it may also clinically present with features indistinguishable from appendicitis [4]. This latter presentation may occur in bacterial ileocecitis, caused by Yersinia, Campylobacter, or Salmonella. Imaging studies show mural thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum without inflammation of the surrounding fat (Fig. 6), and moderate mesenteric adenopathy. Fig. 7.- 29-year-old woman with epiploic appendagitis. A, Sonography of the right lower quadrant reveals a hyperechoic inflamed fatty mass (arrowheads) adjacent to the colon (arrow), at the spot of maximum tenderness. B, On unenhanced CT the fatty lesion contains a characteristic hyperattenuating ring (arrow) corresponding to thickened visceral peritoneal lining.
Epiploic appendagitis:
Epiploic appendages are small adipose protrusions from the serosal surface of the colon. An epiploic appendage may undergo torsion and secondary inflammation, causing focal abdominal pain that simulates appendicitis when located in the right lower quadrant. Epiploic appendagitis is a self-limiting disease that has been reported in approximately 1% of patients clinically suspected of having appendicitis [5]. Sonography and CT depict an inflamed fatty mass adjacent to the colon (Fig. 7), containing a characteristic hyperattenuating ring of thickenend visceral peritoneal lining on CT [5]. Fig. 8.- 41-year-old man with omental infarction. A, Sonography of the right middle abdomen shows a large area of inflamed intraperitoneal fat (arrowheads). B, Unenhanced CT depicts the lesion as a cake-like area of dense inflamed omental fat (arrowheads), larger than in epiploic appendagitis and lacking a hyperattenuating ring.
Omental infarction:
Omental infarction has a pathophysiology and clinical presentation similar to that of epiploic appendagitis, with the infarcted fatty tissue being a right-sided segment of the omentum. Imaging shows a cakelike inflamed fatty mass (Fig. 8), larger than in epiploic appendagitis and lacking a hyperattenuating ring on CT. Fig. 9.- 47-year-old woman with acute right lower quadrant pain. Unenhanced CT shows an ovoid inflamed fatty mass (arrowhead) with normal regional bowel loops. The shape and size of the lesion suggests epiploic appendagitis, but the lesion does not contain a hyperattenuating ring. In this case, it is difficult to discriminate between epiploic appendagitis or a small omental infarction. In some cases it may be difficult to distinguish epiploic appendagitis from omental infarction (Fig. 9), however, this distinction has no clinical importance as both have a similar benign natural history [5]. Fig. 10.- 51-year-old man with right-sided colonic diverticulitis. A, Unenhanced CT shows extensive with fat-standing along the cecal wall (arrowheads), and a normal appendix (arrow). B, Sonography reveals the cause of the inflammation by depicting an inflamed cecal diverticulum (arrow) centred in the hyperechoic fat.
Right-sided colonic diverticulitis:
Right-sided colonic diverticulitis may clinically mimic appendicitis or cholecystitis, though the patient's history is generally more protracted. In contrast to sigmoid diverticula, right-sided colonic diverticula are usually true diverticula, that is, outpouchings of the colonic wall containing all layers of the wall. This may possibly explain the essentially benign self- limiting character of right-sided diverticulitis [6]. Sonography and CT findings consist of inflammatory changes in the pericolic fat with segmental thickening of the colonic wall, at the level of an inflamed diverticulum (Fig. 10). Fig. 11.- 28-year-old man with acute ileocecal Crohn disease.A and B, Sonography shows transmural wall thickening of the terminal ileum (arrows) in longitudinal (A) and transverse (B) section, with hyperechoic inflammatory changes of the surrounding fat (arrowheads).C, Contrast-enhanced CT confirms the wall thickening and luminal narrowing of the terminal and pre-terminal ileum (arrowheads), with regional fat-stranding.
Crohn disease:
Crohn disease often causes long-standing symptoms, but up to one third of patients with ileocecal Crohn disease present with initial symptoms so acute that they are misdiagnosed as appendicitis [7]. In the acute active phase of ileocecal Crohn disease, imaging shows transmural bowel wall thickening, often predominantly of the submucosal layer, with frequent inflammatory changes of the surrounding fat (Fig. 11). Uncomplicated Crohn disease can initially be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.
Other nonsurgical mimics of appendicitis:
Fig. 12.- 39-year-old woman with pelvic inflammatory disease.A, Endovaginal sonography shows an inhomogeneously enlarged right ovary (arrowheads).B and C, Contrast-enhanced CT shows enlargement of the ovaries (B, arrows) with ill-defined contours of the ovaries and uterus, and some free pelvic fluid (C, arrow).
Gynecologic conditions:
Gynecologic conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease or a hemorrhagic functional ovarian cyst can cause acute pelvic pain that may simulate appendicitis. In pelvic inflammatory disease the imaging findings vary according to the severity of the disease, and may be normal in early conditions. In more advanced stages, findings may include enlargement of the internal genital organs with indistinct contours, and free pelvic fluid (Fig.
12). In absence of a drainable tubo-ovarian abscess, treatment is medically with antibiotics. An hemorrhagic ovarian cysts appears as a complicated cyst at sonography and a high- attenuation adnexal mass at unenhanced CT, and does not require any treatment. Fig. 13. 77-year-old man with a right ureteral stone.Unenhanced CT shows an obstructing calcification (arrow) within the distal ureteral lumen.
Urolithiasis:
Urolithiasis may present with right lower quadrant pain when obstruction is caused by a distal ureteral stone. Unenhanced CT (Fig. 13) is more accurate in detecting ureteral stones than sonography, Fig. 14. 40-year-old woman with a ureteral stone.A and B, Sonography shows right-sided hydronephrosis (A), and an obstructing calculus (B, arrow) in the distal ureter at the level of the iliac vessels. Ultrasound may show both hydronephrosis and hydroureter as signs of obstruction (Fig. 14). Fig. 15.- 68-year-old woman with a rectus sheath hematoma.A, Sonography depicts a small painfull lesion (arrow) within the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle in the right lower quadrant. The lesion contains a fluid-fluid level.B, Unenhanced CT depicts the lesion as a partly hyperdense mass (arrow) within the rectus sheath.
Rectus sheath hematoma:
A rectus sheath hematoma may be easy to diagnose in patients presenting with a painful palpable mass under anticoagulant therapy, however, small nonpalpable hematomas may clinically masquerade as appendicitis and also occur in patients without anticoagulantia [8]. Sonography and CT show a hemorrhagic mass within the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle (Fig. 15). No treatment is required other than adjusting any anticoagulant therapy.
Conclusion:
A broad spectrum of nonsurgical diseases may clinically present as appendicitis in patients without appendicitis. The radiologist should be aware of the sonographic and CT features of these alternative disorders, as a correct imaging diagnosis prevents an unwarranted operation and unnecessary hospital resource use.

CT in Abdominal Trauma:
Stephen Ledbetter and Robin Smithuis
Department of Radiology of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston and the Rijnland Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2007-08-02 / update 2022-07-07 This review is based on a presentation given by Stephen Ledbetter and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Stephen Ledbetter is director of the emergency radiology department of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, which is a teaching affiliate of the Harvard Medical School. This review will focus on the role of CT in the evaluation of patients with traumatic abdominal injuries. Some of the cases will be presented in an interactive way.
Introduction:
Click to enlarge Trauma is the leading cause of death under the age of forty. Of all traumatic deaths, abdominal trauma is responsible for 10%. The findings to look for in abdominal trauma are the following: Nowadays there is a trend towards non-operative management of blunt abdominal trauma. More than 50% of splenic injury, 80% of liver injury and virtually all renal injurys are managed non-operatively, because patients proved to have better outcomes on the long term related to visceral salvage. CT is used to evaluate patients with blunt trauma not only initially, but also for follow up, when patients are treated non-operatively. CT is also used to clear patients before they are dismissed from the ER, because CT has a very high negative predictive value and can rule out injury. These patients do not have to be admitted for observation.
The sensitivity and specificity of CT in blunt abdominal injury is 96 to 100% and 94 to 100%, respectively. CT is also increasingly used for penetrating trauma, which traditionally was evaluated operatively, but the CT-results should be interpreted with caution as the sensitivity and specificity in penetrating abdominal injury is lower than for blunt trauma (31.3% to 100% and 81 to 84%, respectively).
In haemodynamically unstable patients there is already an indication for surgery and you may wanna skip the CT, unless to determine the damage outside the perioperative visual range.
CT Protocol:

Multiphase CT:
In the original article in 2007 the standard method of scanning was the venous phase at 70 seconds post injection and in some cases a subsequent delayed excretory scan 3-5 minutes later if injury was detected on the initial scan. Nowadays the importance of the arterial scan is recognized.
Here we present the protocol and indications as advised by the radiological society of the Netherlands. A multi-phase CT abdomen is an accurate form of imaging for the diagnosis or exclusion of vascular injury or active intra-abdominal hemorrhage. 
In addition, the scan in the arterial phase can serve as a “roadmap” for the interventional radiologist or the vascular surgeon. The alternative can be a so-called split-bolus scan (arterial phase and venous phase combined in one scan). The disadvantage of such scans is that it can be more difficult to detect a contrast extravasation due to the lack of a temporal phase difference and the potentially reduced visibility of arteries compared to the pure arterial scan. 
The advantage of such a scan is the lower radiation dose.
Secretory CT:
For the detection of lesions of the collecting system of the kidneys, ureteral and bladder lesions, venous phase CT is moderately sensitive. The sensitivity is increased by adding a secretion phase after 7 to 10 minutes. In the table the indication for an additional scan in the excretory phase are listed. Oral contrast can sometimes help to diagnose hollow organ lesions, but did not proof to increase the sensitivity of CT abdomen without oral contrast and is therefore not indicated.
Spleen:
Click to enlarge The spleen is the most commonly injured solid organ (25%). The finding of contrast extravasation  has great impact on the patients management, because when there is active bleeding, there will be failure of non-operative management in 80% of the cases. In these patients the need for intervention is almost ten times as high compared to patients without extravasation. The table shows the CT findings in the spleen injury scale. Vascular injury is defined as a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula and appears as a focal collection of vascular contrast that decreases in attenuation with delayed imaging. Active bleeding from a vascular injury presents as vascular contrast, focal or diffuse, that increases in size or attenuation in delayed phase. Vascular thrombosis can lead to organ infarction. The spleen injury grade is based on the highest grade assessment made on imaging, at operation or on pathologic specimen. Enable Scroll

There are lacerations and also active bleeding with a contrast blush with the density within the range of the density of the aorta. There also is hemoperitoneum, so this patient will probably need surgery.
Liver:
Liver laceration with active bleeding In trauma the liver is the second most commonly involved solid organ in the abdomen after the spleen. However liver injury is the most common cause of death. This is due to the fact that there are many major vessels in the liver, like the IVC, hepatic veins, hepatic artery and portal vein. It is important to remember, especially if you are doing ultrasound, that the posterior segment of the right liver lobe is the most frequently injured part. This part also involves the bare area and this can lead to retroperitoneal bleeding rather than bleeding into the peritoneal cavity. Liver injury. The arrows indicate different types of injury. First look at the images on the left of a patient with liver injury. Describe the findings. Then continue. The findings are:
Liver injury scale:
The AAST (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma) liver injury scale was revised in 2018. First look at the images on the left of a patient with liver injury. What are the CT findings in this case? The findings are the following: First look at the images on the left of a patient with liver injury. What are the CT findings in this case? The findings are the following: So despite the fact that there is a contrast extravasation, this patient will be treated non-operatively and probably will do fine, because there is no bleeding into the peritoneal cavity. Contrast extravasation is of great importance especially if it is associated with hemoperitoneum. Liver lacerations On the left two more examples of laceration. Lacerations can be stellate, like the example on the left or branching like the one on the right. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll First look at the images on the left of a patient with liver injury. Questions: There is i.v. contrast and images were taken in the portal phase. There is also oral contrast filling of the stomach. The contrast surrounding the liver could be a result of stomach or bowel perforation, but since there was no pneumoperitoneum, this was thought to be unlikely. So the extravasation was thought to be a result of active bleeding and since there is a great amount of contrast surrounding the liver, this was thought to be a huge leak. At the OR an avulsed right hepatic vein was found. This diagnosis has a 90-100% mortality and this patient died in the OR. Some final remarks concerning liver injury:

No sensation or movement in lower extremities. Gun shot wound entry in right upper quadrant. No hematuria. The white object within the spinal column (yellow arrow) is a bullet fragment. Penetrating injury Look at the images on the left and try to answer the following questions: Answers: Findings: There is also a hematoma in the perirenal space.
+ In the delayed phase there is more extravasation, although it is not clear whether that is due to the active bleeding or contrast comming out of the collecting system
+ In the extretory phase it is clear that there is violation of the collecting system The next question is, whether the protocol is correct or do we need to give rectal contrast to see if there is bowelperforation, because there is a penetrating trauma? In this case the answer is no, do not give this patient rectal contrast. The reason is that we already have reached the treshold for this patient to go to the OR. There are 3 reasons for this patient to go to surgery: If rectal contrast was given at the start of the examination, this might pose the problem that it would have been unclear, whether the contrast deposition was due to active bleeding or bowel perforation. So the bleeding could have been missed. Rectal contrast should only have been given if there were no other findings in need of surgery. Although this patient had severe renal injury, there was no hematuria. This is often the case in penetrating trauma and does not rule out renal injury. In blunt trauma however the abcense of hematuria does rule out renal injury. Knife stab in the right flank On the left another patient with a penetrating injury due to a knife stab in the flank. The CT demonstrates nicely, that the injury is limited to the retroperitoneal space with a small renal hematoma. There is no sign of peritoneal violation and on delayed images (not shown) there was no extravasation of the collecting system. This patient will be treated non-operatively Blunt injury In 90% of cases there will be renal injury due to blunt trauma. Unlike in injury to the spleen and the liver, in renal trauma we also need to evaluate the collecting system. Renal injury scale according to the Organ Injury Scale of the American Association of Surgery of Trauma (AAST) The grading system on the left has proven to be of value in the management of the patient. However unlike the grading for spleen and liver injury it is not that simple to remember. In grade I there is nothing wrong with the parenchyma, just contusion or subcapsular hematoma. Grade II and III injuries are either less or greater than 1 cm lacerations, but with no injury to the collecting system. Grade IV is injury to the collecting system or large lacerations> Grade V is a shattered or devascularized kidney. First look at the images on the left of a patient with renal injury after a blunt trauma. What is the CT grade of injury? The answer is, that like all grading systems, this system also has its limitations. What we see on the left is not a laceration, because it is not linear. It is not a contusion, because it is sharply demarcated. This is an post traumatic segmental infarction. On the left a typical subcapsular hematoma, which is also a grade I renal injury. Some final remarks on renal injury: Click to enlarge
Categories of Renal Injuries:
Michael Federle placed renal injuries into four categories:
Bladder:
On the left a 65-year old male struck by a car traveling at moderate speed. Loss of consciousness for 2 minutes. A foley catheter was passed and there was gross hematuria. The x-ray shows a moderately displaced fracture of the pubic bone with bony spicules in the bladder region. So the question is: For what other pelvic injuries is this patient at risk and how will it affect our protocol? First this patient is at risk for arterial injury with pelvic hematoma, rectal, vaginal injury and bladder injury. Secondly, a CT-cystogram is indicated after the routine CT. On the left the images of the routine trauma-CT. What are the findings? There is a displaced pelvic fracture with a spicule pointing towards the bladder. There is fluid in the prevesicle space (space of Rezius). If there is a pelvic fracture the chance of a bladder rupture is 10%. If there is a bladder rupture, there is almost always a pelvic fracture. First it was thought that the rupture was caused by the pelvic fracture itself, but now we know that only in one third of cases the bladder rupture is at the site of the bone spicule. Two third of rupture occur at the opposite site, meaning that shearing forces play a significant role in bladder injuries. On the left the pre- and post-cystogram images. There is contrast in the bladder surrounding the foley catheter and there is extravasation of contrast in the prevesicle space or space of Rezius. This has been referred to as the 'molar tooth sign' indicating extraperitoneal bladder rupture. On the left a sagittal and coronal reconstruction. Notice that there is no contrast extending into the pericolic gutter, so there is no intraperitoneal extention. The sensitivity and specificity of CT Cystography is very high. For extraperitoneal rupture it is respectively 100% and 99% and for intraperitoneal rupture it is 92% and 100%. The most important factor is that you have to have good distention of the bladder.
CT Cystography:
First we drain the bladder, because we want to get rid of the urine and contrast that was excreted by the kidneys. The contrast solution that we use is the same as we use for oral or rectal contrast (i.e. 50 cc contrast in 1L saline). We instill the contrast retrograde through the foley catheter until one of three things happen: On the left another case to illustrate why you do not administer contrast in the bladder at the same time as the administration of iv. contrast. The next question that comes up, is whether we should perform an additional CT-cystogram? The answer to the first question is that if you would have administered contrast to the bladder at the start of the examination, you would have been puzzled whether the contrast that is seen is due to a bladder rupture or to active bleeding. Since no contrast was instilled in the bladder, it is obvious, that this is arterial bleeding. Secondly because of the enormous extravasation, this patient is in need of immediate embolisation without further delay.
Pancreas:
Concerning pancreatic injury the following remarks can be made: On the left an unrestrained driver who had a car accident. Vital signs were stable and there was only a mildly tender abdomen. First look at the images on the left and then continue. All the intraperitoneal organs were normal and there was no intraperitoneal fluid. The only findings were a vague hypodense area in the pancreatic tail and some fluid behind the pancreas, best seen anteriorly to the left kidney. So the radiologist said that there was concern about pancreatic injury. The reason that he was not more definitive was that, an isolated pancreatic injury is exceptionally rare, since the pancreas is protected by the liver and spleen and the bony thorax. During follow up this patient experienced more pain and on a follow up scan (not shown) there was impressive accumulation of fluid around the pancreas. So this patient had an isolated pancreatic injury. The case above is an exceptional case. When the pancreas is involved in a trauma, it is almost always part of a package injury (Table).

Disable Scroll The more common presentation of pancreatic injury is what is seen on the left. Scroll through the images and describe the findings. Then continue. This is a typical left sided package injury. There is pancreatic tail injury and also splenic injury, renal injury and pneumoperitoneum. Right sided package injury involving the pancreas. On the left another common presentation of pancreatic injury. Look at the images and describe the findings. Then continue. There is a right sided package injury. There is a liver laceration crossing the major vessels associated with a transsection of the pancreas at the junction of the head and the body. The force must have come from the right anterior side squeezing the liver and the pancreas against the spine. Sometimes this kind of injury also involves the duodenum.
Diafragmatic injury:
On the left a chest film of a 79-year old restrained driver who had a car accident. Initially unresponsive at the scene. He was transferred from an outside hospital after placement of tubes. Look at the image on the left and describe the findings. Then continue. The first thing you'll notice is that the tube is in the right main bronchus. Chest tube looks okay. Nasogastric tube comes down and coils in the stomach. The superior mediastinum looks widened and indistinct, so this certainly has to be evaluated. In the left lower zone we have an indistinct diafragmatic border and an opacity. This could be a lot of things like hematothorax, lung contusion, diafragmatic rupture or splenic injury. So based on the chest film we are conceirned about possible aortic injury, pulmonary contusion and injury to the diaphragm, spleenic and left kidney. Continue with the CT images. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images on the left. What contrast is on board adn wh at are the findings? There is i.v. contrast in the late arterial phase and when we follow the nasogastric tube we will notice that there is no contrast in the stomach. The most important finding in this case is the area of soft tissue density next to the atelectatic lower lobe of the lung and lateral to it an amount of fat. This is very suggestive of diafragmatic rupture. What can we do to get more certainty about this structure? Since the nasogastric tube is in place, we can administer contrast to the stomach. The images on the left prove that the structure is the stomach, which is in a high position. Secondly there is a waist in the stomach compatible with the 'collar sign'. These findings are specific for diafragmatic rupture.
CT 'collar' sign:
On the left the coronal reconstruction of the same patient demonstrating the 'collar sign', where the stomach passes through the diafragmatic rupture. So in the case above specific signs of diafragmatic injury are present. Non-specific signs are discontinuity or thickening of the diafragm or the 'dependent viscera' sign. 'Dependent viscera' sign in left-sided diafragmatic rupture
'Dependent viscera' sign:
On the left a demonstration of the 'dependent viscera' sign. On the left side there clearly is a diafragmatic rupture with herniation of the stomach. Notice that the stomach and the spleen lie against the posterior thoracic wall, which is abnormal.

However when there are multiple bilateral infarcts, we have to think of an embolic source. The most common location after injury for these emboli is in the thoracic aorta at the isthmus, because the aorta is fixated there. In this patient however the source was a traumatic dissection of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm. This is the second most common location for injury to the aorta due to the relative fixation. .

In the patient that we discussed the diffuse wall thickening was only a result of hypoperfusion or 'shock' bowel due to the active bleeding. Direct injury to the bowel wall usually results in focal thickening and is mostly a non-transmural injury. It is very uncommon to identify findings that are specific for bowel injury like extravasation of oral contrast or bowel content. More commonly you will find a combination of intraperitoneal fluid and mesenteric stranding, focal bowel thickening or interloop fluid, that is very suggestive for bowel injury. by Akira Kawashima, MD, Carl M.

A continued trend is noted for detection of specific findings that do predict the need for therapeutic surgery or for angiographic embolization or that predict a period of close observation is needed for an injured patient. This trend in imaging parallels a strong trend in trauma therapy toward nonoperative management of injuries of the spleen, liver, and kidney even when hemoperitoneum is present.

Histology of the GI tract:
From inside to outside the layers of the small bowel are the mucosa (M.), the submucosa (S.M.), the circular muscle layer (C.M.), the longitudinal muscle layer (L.M.) and the serosa (S.)
US fingerprint of the normal GI tract:
The classic five-layer-US-structure of the bowel wall is easiest apprehended  by studying the wall of  the fluid filled stomach. The layers, starting from inside to outside, are hyper-hypo-hyper-hypo-hyper-echoic or white-black-white-black-white. The US architecture of the wall is essentially the same from the stomach to the rectum. Superficial mucosa The superficial mucosa is brightly hyperechoic, due to mucus and very tiny air-particles caught between the small intestinal villi. It is not separately identifiable, when it blends with hyperechoic feces, as in this US image of the colon. The outer white serosa can only be identified when there is ascites. When a high frequency probe is used, the middle three layers, deep mucosa, submucosa and muscularis (black-white-black) are always visible. In this patient with severe coprostasis, the three-layer wall architecture could only be recognized with a 12 MHz probe. Deep Mucosa The deep mucosa is hypoechoic and has a variable thickness. It represents the packed glandular tissue and - for only a small part-  the muscularis mucosae. Especially in the terminal ileum of children and young adults, prominent echolucent lymphoid tissue is found in the deep mucosa. These so-called Peyer’s patches (p) may be impressively large and asymmetrical. Submucosa The submucosa contains vessels, nerves and fat and is hyperechoic due to abundant loose connective tissue. In this patient with ulcerative colitis, prominent vessels (arrows) in the submucosa are visualized and proven with color Doppler in the right image. The submucosa “loosely connects” the mucosa with the muscularis, and during contraction, the submucosa can be seen to follow the mucosal folds (left upper). After drinking water, the mucosa and submucosa are stretched and unfolded (right upper). This loose connection also explains why gastroscopical biopsies can be taken unpunished, especially when the submucosa is injected with saline first (right under). Muscularis The muscularis is hypoechoic due to muscular tissue and as outer black layer is easy to identify. It consists of  two layers: an inner circular muscle layer and an outer longitudinal muscle layer, which cooperate to produce peristaltic movements. These two muscular layers are separated by a thin layer of connective tissue, containing the neural tissue of the Auerbach plexus. This thin layer (arrowheads) is hyperechoic on US and can be seen in the small bowel of lean patients. Although clinically not relevant, the separate US identification of the Auerbach plexus, underlines the high resolution of US compared to CT and MRI. (M= muscularis, BV= Bloodvessels, S= serosa, TC= tenia coli) The muscularis of the large bowel is different from that of the small bowel. The longitudinal muscle layer is limited to three longitudinally oriented bands, known as teniae coli. In the empty, compressed colon in thin patients, these three teniae (arrowheads), can often be identified by US as a local thickening of the muscular layer, separated from the circular layer by a thin hyperechoic line. In this longitudinal view only one tenia coli (arrowheads) is identified. Serosa The serosa or visceral peritoneum is the thin but tough outer hyperechoic layer, which usually blends with the hyperechoic fatty tissue of mesentery and omentum, surrounding  the bowel. If there is intraperitoneal fluid, the hyperechoic serosa (arrow) can be separately identified, as in these ileal loops.
Stomach:
In most patients referred for US, the stomach is empty, either  because they have been asked not to drink too much prior to the examination, or because they have vomited associated with their acute abdominal problem. If the stomach is fluid-filled and  the patient denies previous drinking, this is a relevant finding. It may be mechanical obstruction,  gastric paresis or hypersecretion with stasis due to active peptic ulcer disease. Antrum and duodenal bulb are the parts of the stomach best identified by US. The pylorus is recognized as a local thickening of the muscularis distally to the antrum. The wall of the duodenal bulb is thinner than that of the stomach. Gastric fluid can be used to improve visualization of  the antrum and duodenal area, by turning patients on their right side: air rises to the gastric fundus, and fluid enters antrum and duodenal bulb. This is especially helpful in adults with  peptic ulcer disease. The left image shows a gastric ulcer (arrow). Note the loss of layer structure in the ventral stomach wall and the inflamed fat (asterisks) representing the omentum and mesentery, trying to wall-off the imminent perforation from this deep penetrating gastric ulcer. The right image shows an ulcer (arrow) in the ventral wall of the fluid-filled duodenal bulb. Descending and horizontal duodenum are rarely accessible for US. When specifically looked for,  large air-filled duodenal diverticula, present in 10-15 % of the normal population,  can be identified. They present as a (curvi)linear reflection within the pancreatic head. Note that these patients often have a wider common bile duct than normal patients. Enable Scroll

Small bowel:
The normal small bowel is easily visualized by US and is recognized by continuous and vivid peristalsis, even if the lumen is empty. Note multiple small round echolucencies with a hyperechoic border within the bright submucosa. These represent normal 0.4 – 0.5 mm vessels. Note also the thin hyperechoic line within the muscularis, representing the connective tissue separating the longitudinal and circular muscle layer, containing the Auerbach plexus. Enable Scroll

Jejunum:
The jejunum (left image) is mainly located in the LUQ, and contains more Kerckring’s folds (valvulae conniventes) than the ileum (right image), which is more located in the RLQ. Measuring bowel wall thickness with US is difficult because thickness changes with peristaltic movements. In this individual, measurements in the longitudinal plane (upper panel)  and in the axial plane during light compression (left under) vary considerably, but during moderate compression (right under) measurements are well reproducible and accurate. As the thin hyperechoic serosa is rarely discernible, bowel wall thickness is  measured from the outer contour of the ventral muscularis to the outer contour of the dorsal muscularis, and then of course, divided by two. Normally, single small bowel wall thickness during compression is about 1.5 - 2.5 mm. Measuring bowel wall thickness by US this way  is reproducible and comparable to what surgeons do with their fingers during laparotomy to decide whether small bowel is abnormal. In contrast to most diseased bowel loops, normal small bowel loops are well compressible during relaxation. Compare a normal terminal ileum (left) and a Crohn’s ileum (right), without compression (upper images) and with compression (lower images). Note the same cm-scale in all four US-images. Single wall thickness in the normal individual is 1.5 mm, in the Crohn patient 6.5 mm
Terminal ileum:
The terminal ileum can often be identified separately due to its specific location and course from the pelvis toward the paracolic gutter. The  actual discharging of the normal terminal ileum into the cecum can only be seen in thin patients with an empty cecum. The location of the ileocecal valve may vary widely, but its average location is right of the umbilicus. Note the lymphoid hyperplasia of the Peyer’s patches in the terminal ileum. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll More frequently the terminal ileum can be followed until it disappears into the feces-filled cecum. These are images of the terminal ileum in three different children and young adults with large Peyer’s patches presenting as asymmetrical, hypoechoic thickening of the deep mucosa. With every new antigen, the lymphoid tissue becomes reactivated. In young patients both mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches are –also in absolute dimensions- much larger than in adults. The stimulated lymphoid tissue in youngsters not only results in prominent Peyer’s patches in the terminal ileum and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (left under), but also in a thickened deep mucosa of the appendix (right under). Note that the –sometimes polyp-like- protrusions (right upper), may act as lead-point in the classic ileocecal intussusception in young children
Intussusception:
Here the US image in a 2 year-old child with intermittent ileocecal intussusception, examined in between attacks. The ileum with abundant Peyer’s patches shows prolaps into the cecum. Classic US image of ileocecal intussusceptions in two different children. In both, the intussuscepted ileum is asymmetrically positioned within the intussuscipiens, due to the hyperechoic fatty mesentery, attached to the ileum and following the ileum, when pulled in. Within the mesentery US shows an enlarged mesenteric lymph node (ln) in both. These nodes are enlarged as part of the general lymphoid hyperplasia and are not localised in the ileal lumen. Therefore it is not the primary lead point. In the patient on the right, the appendix (arrow) is pulled in also. Note  the multi-layered aspect of the ventral wall of the intussusception complex, representing three folded bowel wall layers. Although the lymphoid tissue in the terminal ileum is most impressive in the young child, it may be found until the age of 20 years. In this young man of 15 years with an acute appendicitis (arrowheads), there are still prominent Peyer’s patches (p.) in the deep mucosa of the terminal ileum. During US examination, it is not unusual to witness a small, transient, ileo-ileal intussusception. Apart from lack of symptoms, these can be discriminated by US  from the real symptomatic intussusception, because they are smaller (< 2 cm), compressible, transient and have no lead point. These transient intussusceptions may be associated with celiac disease and it is important to exclude this condition with blood tests.
Omentum, mesentery and lymph nodes:
The normal omentum is usually not separately visible. When it is thickened e.g. in malignant or, more rarely, in tuberculous peritonitis, it may present as omental cake, especially if there is concomitant ascites. US can also visualize the omentum (arrowheads)  in segmental omental infarction, in which the omentum is swollen due to venous hemorrhagic infarction. The small bowel is attached to the mesentery which is folded like a fan. The mesentery contains a variable amount of fat, and the folded, fatty mesentery has a multi-layered aspect, especially when compressed during US. The normal mesentery (arrows)  in thin patients is only visible when there is ascites. In the obese, the mesentery contains a lot of fat and can be visualized as a well-compressible, flat, multi-layered structure. In one plane this may simulate a thickened bowel wall (arrows in left image) . Turning the probe 90 degrees (right image), it is immediately recognized as a flat structure (arrows). Click image for animation. At the edge of the fatty mesentery, vivid peristalsis in two small bowel loops can be visualized. Click image for animation.
Epiploic appendages:
Next to mesentery and omentum, also the properitoneal fat is part of the intra-abdominal fatty tissue, as are the epiploic appendages (arrows). They have a fragile blood supply (white arrowheads) , prone to hemorrhagic infarction (epiploic appendagitis). Normal epiploic appendages are only visible on US and CT  in case of ascites. Within the mesentery the mesenteric lymph nodes can be visualized, predominantly in the region right of the umbilicus. During graded compression in thin patients the nodes appear very close to psoas muscle and iliac vessels. The dimensions of the normal mesenteric lymph node are variable, in this case the dimensions in three planes are 3 x 11 x 16 mm. Although transverse and longitudinal diameters may even be larger, the shortest axial diameter in adults should not exceed 5 mm. In case of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, it is -initially- only the shortest axial diameter that increases. Therefore, to decide whether a node is normal or abnormal, measuring the shortest axial diameter suffices. The shape of  a normal versus an abnormal mesenteric lymph node, is that of an almond versus an olive. In children, especially those of 5 to 10 years old, the mesenteric lymph nodes are much larger than in adults, with short axial diameters up to 10 mm. These large mesenteric lymph nodes in children, may be associated with viral infections, but can be found in otherwise healthy kids. Normal mesenteric lymph nodes have a relatively hyperechoic center and a lobulated, echolucent peripheral zone, representing the germinal centers.
Appendix:
An experienced sonographer can identify  the entire normal appendix -including the blind end-  in about 30 % of adult patients and 80 % of children. US visualization of the entire normal appendix, excludes appendicitis. The normal appendix has the same layers as in normal bowel wall. In this young woman all five layers are visible including the serosa, thanks to a little intraperitoneal fluid. Note the empty lumen and the normal triangle-shaped hyperechoic meso-appendix.

Disable Scroll To compress the appendix, a rather firm underground is mandatory like iliac artery, psoas muscle or vertebral body. The normal appendix  (arrowheads) is discriminated from small bowel by its location, its size, its absence of peristalsis, its attachment to the cecal pole (c.p.) and its blind distal end (arrows).

Disable Scroll The blind end of the normal appendix is firmly demonstrated using a “mini-clip”. The US diameter of the appendix is measured the same way as bowel: during moderate compression from outer contour of the ventral muscularis to the outer contour of the dorsal muscularis. Thus measured, the diameter of this normal appendix (left)  is 4.5 mm and of this inflamed appendix (right) 8.5 mm. In many textbooks a cut-off value of 6 mm is reported, however this is not a reliable value. Rettenbacher (Radiology 2001; 218: 757-62) did a large study and  found that  the diameter of the normal appendix was 6 mm or larger in 27 % of cases, with a range of 2-13 mm. The US criteria of appendicitis will be discussed  in a special chapter on appendicitis. CT measurements overestimate the appendix diameter compared to US. In the literature the mean CT diameter of a normal appendix is 6.5- 8 mms (range, 3 to14 mm). The explanation for this discrepancy may be that on CT: The left panel here shows a CT of a normal, feces-filled appendix of 8.5 mm. The middle  panel  is a US image of a comparable normal appendix in a different patient measuring 7.5 mm, the right panel shows that same appendix during compression (5.5.mm). The literature indicates that the US diameter of the normal appendix is 6 mms or less in 73  % of cases. Here you see the normal appendix during compression in ten different patients with AP-diameters varying from 2-10 mm (Note the same cm-scale). In the lower five, the lumen is filled with fecal material of various reflectivity, which make the appendix less compressible. The most important discriminating feature indicating appendicitis is inflamed fat, followed by diameter, non-compressibility, hyperemia and a fixed position. There are of course additional US features in advanced appendicitis, as fluid collections and loss of layer structure, but in these cases it is clear that the appendix is inflamed. More rarely, some intraluminal fluid is seen, in which case the appendix is easily compressible. Not rarely, the blind ending tip  (arrowheads) of the normal appendix has no lumen due to fibrosis. Unlike the inflamed appendix, the normal appendix has no fixed position and during the US examination may appear in different places in the abdominal cavity. If lying in a curved position, the individual sections (arrows) are close to each other, in contrast to the inflamed appendix that becomes more rigid and stretches to some extent. Not infrequently strongly reflective structures (arrows) with an acoustic shadow are found, indicating inspissated feces. As they are small and not calcified on CT, they are no true fecoliths and also do not predispose for appendicitis. US images in this 15 year old boy show a normal compressible appendix with a large fecolith (arrows), producing a hard acoustic shadow. The patient was symptom free at the time of the US examination, but he recalled four,  one-day-lasting, self-limiting episodes of severe RLQ pain over the past nine months, suggestive for recurrent acute appendicitis. After appendectomy he had no more attacks. In children, the deep mucosa may show remarkable hypoechoic thickening due to lymphoid hyperplasia, which may also render the appendix less compressible. This is a common finding in healthy kids, but in case of very prominent hyperplasia, a viral infection may be present. Note the complete absence of inflamed fat.
Colon:
Longitudinal (left) and transverse (right) image of the empty sigmoid in a lean patient. In the transverse image three areas of local thickening of the muscularis (arrowheads) represent the three teniae coli (arrowheads). Normal colon filled with feces (left), during contraction (middle) and during relaxation and compression (right). Normal colon wall thickness during compression is 3-4 mms. Acoustic shadowing of the feces prevents US visualization of the  posterior wall (left). Colon is distinguished from small bowel by location, fecal contents, scarce peristalsis and  a thick outer muscle layer with three tenia coli. The muscularis of the sigmoid may considerably vary in thickness, mainly due to contraction. Permanent thickening of the muscularis is associated with the development of diverticula (arrows). Sigmoid diverticulosis in four different patients. Feces-filled diverticula are best visualized when the colon is contracted. They present as bright reflective structures with an acoustic shadow on the outer contour of the colon. Note the variable thickness of the muscularis in these four patients. Detailed US image of sigmoid diverticulum in very lean 61-year old patient. There is a little feces present in the sigmoid lumen and a large fecolith in the diverticulum (arrows). Note the very thin wall of the diverticulum, consisting of herniated (sub)mucosa covered by a very thin serosa. The herniation through the muscularis, invariably occurs at a weak spot where the vessels penetrate the circular muscle layer, immediately next to the tenia coli (arrowheads). These penetrating vessels are identified by color Doppler in another very lean patient (left under) and illustrated in the Netter image right under. Undigested vegetables may incidentally appear as so-called “black feces” within the colonic lumen. These can be differentiated from colonic polyps by their edgy contours, lack of vascularity, their lack of adherence to the mucosa and their disappearance during follow-up. Incidental finding of a round echolucent structure in the sigmoid lumen. This proved to be a vascularized polyp at color Doppler. Subsequent colonoscopy and histology confirmed a polypoid, tubulovillous adenoma. Colonoscopy found also three other adenomas, not detected by US.
Coronary anatomy and anomalies:
Robin Smithuis and Tineke Willems
Radiology department of the Rijnland Hospital Leiderdorp and the University Medical Centre Groningen, the Netherlands.:
Publicationdate 2008-10-14 In this article we describe the anatomy of the coronary arteries of the heart and some of the anomalies with illustrations and CT-images. This article is an update of an article that appeared earlier in the Radiology Assistant.
Overview:
RCA, LAD and Cx in the anterior projection On the left an overview of the coronary arteries in the anterior projection. RCA, LAD and Cx in the right anterior oblique projection On the left an overview of the coronary arteries in the right anterior oblique projection. RCA, LAD and Cx in the lateral projection On the left an overview of the coronary arteries in the lateral projection. Read more about coronary anatomy inIntroduction to cardiothoracic imaging
Left Coronary Artery (LCA):
Left coronary (LC), right coronary (RC) and posterior non-coronary (NC) cusp The left coronary artery (LCA) is also known as the left main. The LCA arises from the left coronary cusp. The aortic valve has three leaflets, each having a cusp or cup-like configuration. These are known as the left coronary cusp (L), the right coronary cusp (R) and the posterior non-coronary cusp (N). Just above the aortic valves there are anatomic dilations of the ascending aorta, also known as the sinus of Valsalva.
The left aortic sinus gives rise to the left coronary artery. The right aortic sinus which lies anteriorly, gives rise to the right coronary artery. The non-coronary sinus is postioned on the right side. LCA divides into LAD and Cx The LCA divides almost immediately into the circumflex artery (Cx) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). On the left an axial CT-image. The LCA travels between the right ventricle outflow tract anteriorly and the left atrium posteriorly and divides into LAD and Cx. On the image on the left we see the left main artery dividing into On volume rendered images the left atrial appendage needs to be removed to get a good look on the LCA. In 15% of cases a third branch arises in between the LAD and the Cx, known as the ramus intermedius or intermediate branch. This intermediate branche behaves as a diagonal branch of the Cx.
Left Anterior Descending (LAD):
CT image of the LAD in RAO projection The LAD travels in the anterior interventricular groove and continues up to the apex of the heart. The LAD supplies the anterior part of the septum with septal branches and the anterior wall of the left ventricle with diagonal branches. The LAD supplies most of the left ventricle and also the AV-bundle. Mnemonic: Diagonal branches arise from the LAD. The diagonal branches come off the LAD and run laterally to supply the antero-lateral wall of the left ventricle. The first diagonal branch serves as the boundary between the proximal and mid portion of the LAD (2). There can be one or more diagonal branches: D1, D2 , etc.
Circumflex (Cx):
Circumflex and LAD seen in Lateral projection The Cx lies in the left AV groove between the left atrium and left ventricle and supplies the vessels of the lateral wall of the left ventricle. These vessels are known as obtuse marginals (M1, M2...), because they supply the lateral margin of the left ventricle and branch off with an obtuse angle. In most cases the Cx ends as an obtuse marginal branch, but 10% of patients have a left dominant circulation in which the Cx also supplies the posterior descending artery (PDA). Mnemonic: Marginal branches arise from the Cx and supply the lateral Margin of the left ventricle.
Right Coronary Artery (RCA):
RCA, LAD and LCx in Anterior projection The right coronary artery arises from the anterior sinus of Valsalva and courses through the right atrioventricular (AV) groove between the right artium and right ventricle to the inferior part of the septum. In 50-60% the first branch of the RCA is the small conus branch, that supplies the right ventricle outflow tract. In 20-30% the conus branch arises directly from the aorta. In 60% a sinus node artery arises as second branch of the RCA, that runs posteriorly to the SA-node (in 40% it originates from the Cx). The next branches are some diagonals that run anteriorly to supply the anterior wall of the right ventricle. The large acute marginal branch (AM) comes off with an acute angle and runs along the  margin of the right ventricle above the diaphragm. The RCA continues in the AV groove posteriorly and gives off a branch to the AV node. In 65% of cases the posterior descending artery (PDA) is a branch of the RCA (right dominant circulation). The PDA supplies the inferior wall of the left ventricle and inferior part of the septum. LEFT: RCA comes off the right sinus of ValsalvaRIGHT: Conus artery comes off directly from the aorta On the image on the far left we see the most common situation, in which the RCA comes off the right cusp and will provide the conus branch at a lower level (not shown). On the image next to it, we see a conus branch, that comes off directly from the aorta. The large acute marginal branch (AM) supplies the lateral wall of the right ventricle. In this case there is a right dominant circulation, because the posterior descending artery (PDA) comes off the RCA.
Coronary Anomalies:
Coronary anomalies are uncommon with a prevalence of 1%. Early detection and evaluation of coronary artery anomalies is essential because of their potential association with myocardial ischemia and sudden death (3). With the increased use of cardiac-CT, we will see these anomalies more frequently. Coronary anomalies can be differentiated into anomalies of the origin, the course and termination (Table). The illustration in the left upper corner is the most common and clinically significant anomaly. There is an anomalous origin of the LCA from the right sinus of Valsalva and the LCA courses between the aorta and pulmonary artery. This interarterial course can lead to compression of the LCA (yellow arrows) resulting in myocardial ischemia. The other anomalies in the figure on the left are not hemodynamically significant.
Interarterial LCA:
On the left images of a patient with an anomalous origin of the LCA from the right sinus of Valsalva and coursing between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Sudden death is frequently observed in these patients.
ALCAPA:
On the left images of a patient with an anomalous origin of the LCA from the pulmonary artery, also known as ALCAPA. ALCAPA results in the left ventricular myocardium being perfused by relatively desaturated blood under low pressure, leading to myocardial ischemia. ALCAPA is a rare, congenital cardiac anomaly accounting for approximately 0.25-0.5% of all congenital heart diseases. Approximately 85% of patients present with clinical symptoms of CHF within the first 1-2 months of life.
Myocardial bridging:
Myocardial bridging is most commonly observed of the LAD (figure). The depth of the vessel under the myocardium is more important that the lenght of the myocardial bridging. There is debate, whether some of these myocardial bridges are hemodynamically significant. Left to right shunt: septal branch of LAD teminates in right ventricle
Fistula:
On the image on the left we see a large LAD giving rise to a large septal branch that terminates in the right ventricle (blue arrow). by Carl Jaffe and Patrick J. Lynch

US of the GI tract - Technique:
Julien Puylaert
Medical center Haaglanden in the Hague and Academical Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 3-4-2020 The GI tract is the most challenging part of the abdomen to examine by US. 
Although technically demanding, its results have great clinical implications in early triage of bowel diseases and in the acute abdomen. 
This is the first of a series on US of the GI tract. Press ctrl+for larger images and text on a PC or ⌘+ on a Mac.

Examination technique:
Thickening of mucosa and submucosa in Clostridium colitis Modern ultrasound machines provide high resolution images of the GI tract, like in this patient with massive thickening of mucosa and submucosa in Clostridium colitis. However nowadays cheap ultrasound systems consisting of a 1200 euro transducer connected to a tablet or phone will produce images of good quality (see next image). We expect that more doctors and health workers will use ultrasound in their daily practice.
Knowledge of technique, normal anatomy and pathology of the GI tract will be important for patient management. US image made with a 1200 euro probe and tablet.
US machines and probes:
In this lean person, the normal terminal ileum and the normal, compressed appendix (arrow) are visualized on a tablet connected to a 1200 euro probe. For the average abdominal US program with patients of varying habitus, still three probes is the minimum. The cm’s indicate the range where image resolution is optimal. Since bowel lies close to the abdominal wall, the middle and small probe are the workhorses in US of the GI tract. Choice of the probe is based on the depth where the bowel is visualized during compression. For example, the fluid-filled stomach in this obese patient (left), is best studied with the middle-transducer, the normal ileum and appendix in a thin patient (right), with the small transducer. Pre-sets for specific abdominal organs can be helpful, but we use only two abdominal pre-sets per probe: normal and XL for large and obese patients.
The “over-processed” US image:
The processed US image: speckle-noise-reduction Compare the native US images (left) of the pancreatic region with the strongly processed US images (right). In these over-processed images the vessels have a sharper delineation with a completely anechoic lumen. However, also unrealistic reflections and contours are “created”. Note the unnatural bright reflections in the area dorsal from the pancreatic tail (right upper image) and note the bizarre contour of the stomach and the falciform ligament (right lower image).
US examination of bowel:
US of the GI tract has been quite unpopular in the past because of the interference of gas and other bowel contents (upper image). The good news is that pathological bowel usually is often conspicuous, due to local wall thickening and an empty lumen, e.g. in this patient with segmental Crohn’s colitis (lower image). Searching and screening for bowel pathology is best done using the so-called  “mowing-the-lawn” technique. This technique requires graded compression, a high-frequency probe and not too viscous US gel. Like in mowing the lawn, overlapping lanes are necessary, not to miss any pathology. Most commercially available US gels are quite viscous. It has several advantages to make it more fluent by adding about one third of hot tap water. Better skin contact prevents disturbing air-artifacts (arrowheads). It is time-efficient to put the US gel on the patient, and not on the probe. With a normal habitus, one large dose ( ~25 cc) of  diluted US gel is sufficient for the entire examination. A small reservoir in the epigastric area may be used for “dipping”. In general, liberal use of US gel has great advantages. 
There are however two drawbacks: things may get quite messy and hygiene may be endangered. This requires “US gel discipline” and a lot of towels or cleaning tissue. To avoid the cable getting sticky, you can put it around your neck or place it on the patient’s chest when studying the left flank. US gel should be removed from the probe, before putting the probe back. Proper cleaning of the probes after each patient speaks for itself. Ask the manufacturer what to use as cleaning fluid. It is very important to keep the fingers of the probe-hand free of US gel: the combination of rather forceful compression with subtle rotational movements requires a dry hand.
Graded compression:
Advantages compression Compression should be graded and gentle Graded compression is remarkably well tolerated, even in peritonitis. The CT scan shows how intra-abdominal anatomic relations are altered by graded compression. 
During compression, the ventral wall of the bowel is compressed against the dorsal wall, eliminating the disturbing effect of gas and other bowel contents. This sagittal CT scan demonstrates a retrocecal, inflamed appendix (arrowheads) with an obstructing fecolith (arrow). By graded compression with the US probe, the air-filled cecum is pushed aside and the appendix is visualized  close to the abdominal wall (note cm-scale). CT shows contracted colon (arrow) in obese patient. During light compression (middle) the contracted colon can be visualized with a 12 MHz probe. During moderate compression (right), the relaxed colon can even be seen flattened against the dorsally located psoas muscle. CT of an obese patient with inactive ulcerative colitis. The sigmoid lies 9 cms from the skin. During compression (arrowheads) this distance was decreased to 2.5 cms allowing the use of a high frequency probe. Click on image for animation To visualize a tubular structure (e.g. the inflamed appendix) in two perpendicular planes, it is essential to bring the structure in its axial view in the middle of the US image. This allows to keep the structure visible, while rotating the probe 90 degrees (click on image). Gentle “rocking” of the probe during rotation helps in keeping a small tubular structure in sight. The rather ovoid than round shape of most probe-handles is not very helpful in making easy and subtle rotational movements combined with compression. Try to develop a grip that allows you to rotate the probe from your wrist, and not from your arm or shoulder, always trying to hold the red line axis.
Preparation of the patient:
A half-full bladder allows optimal examination of the bladder and distal ureters and uterus and ovaries in women (images). 
In patients with acute abdominal pain, preparation is not an issue: most of the patients have not eaten or have vomited, and are readily instructed not to eat or drink, until a surgical condition is ruled out.
MRI traumatic changes:
Mini Pathria and Jennifer Bradshaw
Department of Radiology of the University of California School of Medicine, San Diego, USA and the Medical Centre Alkmaar, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2009-10-01 This article is based on a presentation given by Mini Pathria and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Jennifer Bradshaw. In part I we will discuss MR features of various muscle injuries. In part II we will discuss non-traumatic muscle changes.
Introduction:
Dr. Pathria is a Professor of Clinical Radiology at the University of California, San Diego . Dr. Pathria's specific areas of interest include musculoskeletal trauma, emergency radiology, and musculoskeletal MR imaging. She is the author of the book MRI of the Musculoskeletal System. Normal muscle is symmetrical with smooth convex borders, linear branching and feathery fat planes and low signal on all sequences When looking at muscle on MR there are a few rules to keep in mind: When looking at muscle pathology try to decide which one of the four basic patterns of abnormality is present: On the left an example of a lipoma creating a mass effect in the anterior compartment of the calf.
Muscle injury:
The most common muscle injury is muscle strain (1). It is an injury to the musculotendinous junction. Typical for muscle strain is edema centered along the musculotendinous junction (1). More severe muscle strains contain fluid collections such as hematomas and may contain grossly interrupted muscle fibers and thus may show masslike features on MR images in addition to muscle edema. Muscle contusions are caused by a direct blow. MR images reveal interstitial hemorrhage as well as edema at the injured site . More severe contusions may contain hematomas and thus reveal a masslike lesion in addition to the edema. Abnormal Signal Intensity in Skeletal Muscle at MR Imaging: Patterns, Pearls, and Pitfalls by David A. May, MD et al October 2000 RadioGraphics, 20, S295-S315
Muscle Strain:
The musculo-tendinous junction extends deeply into the muscle Muscle strain is an injury to the musculotendinous junction. The tendinous junction is where the muscle fibers meet the tendon, and the shape of it varies in different muscles. In many muscles, the tendon extends deeply into the muscle creating a long musculo-tendinous junction (figure). This area is especially important in a trauma setting, because it is often involved. The epimysium is the fibrous tissue that lies at the edge of the muscle. It becomes the muscle sheath that fuses with the tendon. This is also an important area to consider because when there is a tear in the muscle, fluid tends to leak out and collect in the epimysium. The pattern of edema in muscle strain will depend on the architecture and shape of the musculotendinous junction involved. The image on the left nicely demonstrates the feather-like arrangement of the musculotendinous junction in an atrophic muscle. Complete tear of the rectus femoris with edema at the musculotendinous junction (arrows) The image on the left demonstrates edema surrounding the musculotendinous junction in a feather-like arrangement. This is a complete tear to the rectus femoris (arrows). The architecture can be very confusing. For example on the left the rectus femoris, which can show a variety of edema patterns depending on where (anatomically)
the injury took place. The blue arrow demonstrates the tendon of the indirect head, which comes from the hip, it has a vertical orientation
on this axial image. Along the posterior portion of the muscle (yellow arrows), there is a flat area of tendon originating from the knee. When a muscle has different orientations of the tendons it means that there are different patterns of edema possible
depending on the tendon injured. Therefore this is a pattern of edema corresponding to an injury arising from the knee. Muscle Strain (2) Muscle strain is an acute injury. The history is usually very concise. The muscles that are most prone to strain are the long fusiform muscles that cross 2 articulations. Most at risk are the hamstrings, rectus femoris and medial gastrocnemius. Strain involving the upper extremity is slightly less common and then usually involves the biceps brachii. The hallmark of strain is a lot of edema around the myotendinous juntion because that is where the tearing takes place. There is edema around the tendon and sometimes the tendon itself will show signal changes. Myotendinous junction pattern of muscle strain (left) and epimysial strain pattern (right) There are 2 patterns found with muscle strain. By far the most common is the myotendinous junction pattern, which occurs roughly 97% of the time. Depending on the severity of the strain, there might also be fluid collections. The remaining 3% will show an epimysial strain pattern, with the abnormalities found at the periphery of the muscle. Epimysial strain pattern of an acute muscle strain of the supraspinatus muscle Muscle Strain (3) On the left an example of a weight-lifter with an epimysial strain pattern. The tendon tears at the myotendinous junction, and the fluid leaks around the edge of the muscle showing an epimysial appearance. Do not confuse this with a degenerative or impingement-type tear. Strain of the subscapularis muscle On the left a strain with partial tear of the subscapularis. The subscapularis is a convergent muscle (like for example the pectoral muscle) with multiple tendons. Edema will have a multipennate distribution pattern, as the edema tracks in different directions along the multiple tendons. Two different types of musculotendinous junction strain On the far left a complete tear of the indirect head of the rectus femoris (yellow arrow). This tear originates in the hip. The image next to it, which was also shown above, shows a completely different finding. There is edema surrounding the distal tendon that is connected to the patella. The other tendon is completely normal (blue arrow).
Grading muscle strain:
Clinically the severity of a muscle injury is graded from 1-3. Trying to grade a muscle injury by the signal intensity is tricky. Chronic injuries can show mild signal changes and yet still be high grade injuries according to the clinical classification. On the left an example of a tear in the left pectoral muscle. On T1-weighted image there is a gap in the muscle with a small amount of fat filling it up. The gradient echo demonstrates focal fluid accumulation and some increased signal within the muscle. It does not look that severe. However, when asked to fully contract the pectoral muscles there is an obvious asymmetry due to a complete tear in the muscle (blue arrow). This clinically is a grade 3 injury, with a complete loss of function of the muscle.
Low grade muscle strain:
On the left a low grade injury of the flexor hallucis longus. There is normal muscle architecture on the T1-weighted image, and increased signal on T2-weighted image and STIR. The injury will heal completely within a couple of weeks. This example shows edema with an epimysial pattern which is common around the flexor hallucis. When grading acute injuries, look not only at the architecture but also at the length of the muscle. Studies have shown that the length of the muscle strain is the best predictor of the duration of disability, with longer lesions requiring more time to recover. (Reference article by Dr. Connell DA et al, AJR 2004, 83: 975-984). So the longer the abnormality, the longer it takes for the injury to heal. On the left a patient with 2 grades of injury to the gastrocnemius. There is a low grade injury to the lateral head.
Moderate grade muscle strain:
On the left the same patient. There is also a moderate grade injury to the medial head. Note the fluid accumulations around the muscle head. The more fluid, the higher the grade. Moderate grade injury to the rectus femoris muscle On the left an injured rectus femoris muscle. The images demonstrate a moderate grade injury, with architectural distortion and a fluid collection (arrow). Notice the edema at the bipennate musculotendinous junction.
High grade muscle strain:
On the left an example of a high grade injury. There is a complete tear of the tendon or myotendinous junction of the pectoral muscle. This patient will lose all function in this muscle. On the left a complete tear of the left hamstring at the musculotendinous junction. Tthe tendons are avulsed and there is fluid accumulation. Complete hamstring rupture with an epimysial pattern of edema On the left a different patient with also a complete hamstring rupture. There is an epimysial pattern of edema and sciatic nerve irritation.
A hamstring syndrome may occur. This is a painful condition caused by post-traumatic scar formation around the sciatic nerve (arrow). Chronic changes after prior muscle strain
Chronic changes of muscle strain:
On the left images of a patient who had a prior muscle strain. There are typical chronic changes such as focal tendon thickening (blue arrow) and peritendinous muscle atrophy (yellow arrow). On the left images of a patient who had an injury to the long head of the biceps femoris muscle. There are typical chronic changes such as focal tendon thickening (blue arrow) and severe muscle atrophy.
Contusion:
Muscle contusion with edema of the skin, muscle and bone marrow (arrows) Muscle contusions are caused by a direct blow. The MR findings in contusion are similar to strain but without the typical myotendinous junction localization seen in the latter. Typically, there is also skin edema and sometimes, bone contusion. MR images reveal edema at the injured site, frequently due to interstitial hemorrhage as well as edema. More severe contusions may contain hematomas and thus reveal a masslike lesion in addition to edema. It is mostly seen in the superficial muscles. Muscle contusion On the left images of a patient who has a mass-like swelling of the fore-foot. The findings are nonspecific, but the history 'Slammed car door on foot' was specific.
Hemorrhage:
Muscle hematoma and parenchymal hemorrhage Hemorrhage can present as a discrete hematoma or as parenchymal hemorrhage. In the case on the left there is a mixed pattern. The signal intensity of a hematoma on T1W- and T2W-images depends on the stage of the hematoma (Table). Hyperacute hematoma On the left images of a patient who fell on a slippery floor. There is a hyperacute hematoma. Low signal intensity on T1W and high signal on T2W. Acute hematoma On the left an acute hematoma. It is isointense or hypointense to muscle on T1. The hypointensity in T2WI in the acute period is due to the high concentration of intracellular deoxyhemoglobin. Early subacute hematoma On the left images of two different patients with an early subacute hematoma. On the far left a T1-weighted image. The hyperintensity at the periphery of the hematoma is due to methemoglobin which is seen after 2-7 days and can persist for months. The image on the right shows the same hyperintensity on a T2-weighted image. Late subacute hematoma: T1 (left) and T2 (right) On the left a late subacute hematoma with layering. Chronic tennis leg On the left images of two different patients with a chronic hematoma in the calf. On the left a T1-weighted image. Notice the dark rim of hemosiderin surrounding the hematoma. On the right a T2-weighted image of a similar case. Notice that the hemosiderin is also dark on T2-weighted image. Morel-Lavallee lesion
Morel-Lavallee:
On the left a chronic hematoma known as Morel-Lavallee lesion. A Morel-Lavallee lesion is the result of separation of the skin and subcutis from the fascia, producing a cavity that is filled with fluid and debris. These lesions are found around the thigh and have a well-defined oval or fusiform shape. They are usually partially or wholly encapsulated Long-Standing Morel-Lavallee Lesions of the Trochanteric Region and Proximal Thigh: MRI Features in Five Patients by J. M. Mellado et al AJR 2004; 182:1289-1294 Metastasis of a renal cell carcinoma A hematoma can look like a tumor and vice versa. On the left a metastasis of a renal cell carcinoma. When in doubt use gadolinium to see if the abnormality enhances. Continue with the post-Gad image. Metastasis of a renal cell carcinoma with central necrosis The majority of the lesion enhances, making hematoma unlikely. In the centre there is no enhancement as a result of necrosis. Hematomas can show some enhancement, but only at edge.
Myositis ossificans:
Myositis ossificans Severe blunt trauma causing an intra-muscular hematoma may result in delayed ossification in the soft tissues known as myositis ossificans. Myositis ossificans has a variable appearance depending on the maturity: Myositis ossificans On MRI myositis ossificans can be difficult to differentiate from osteosarcoma. On X-rays and CT soft tissue ossification not attached to bone is seen. Myositis ossificans On the left another case of myositis ossificans with bone formation.
Compartment syndrome:
Post fasciotomy for post fracture compartment syndrome Compartment syndrome is a limb-threatening and life-threatening condition observed when perfusion pressure falls below tissue pressure in a closed anatomic space. A fasciotomy procedure with incision in the skin and the muscle fascia is necessary to release the pressure and regain normal function of the capillaries. Compartment syndrome progresses to rhabdomyolysis if untreated. Necrosis of tissue may begin at interstitial pressure as low as 30 mm Compartment Syndrome in Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics Muscle necrosis, post IV gadolinium In the lower leg there are four compartments: the anterior, deep and superficial posterior compartment and a small lateral compartment. On the left T1W-images of a patient one month post trauma. On the post-Gadolinium image the necrosis in the anterior and lateral compartment is seen. The posterior compartment is normal. Chronic lateral compartment syndrome On the left a T2W-image of a patient with a chronic lateral compartment syndrome. Rhabdomyolysis as a result of compartment syndrome On the left a compartment syndrome in the upper leg which progressed to rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is a dissolution of skeletal muscles that causes extravasation of toxic intracellular contents from the myocytes into the circulatory system and can lead to kidney failure. Calcific myonecrosis
Calcific myonecrosis:
Calcific myonecrosis is a rare post- traumatic entity characterized by latent formation of a dystrophic calcified mass occurring almost exclusively in the lower limb. In calcific myonecrosis an entire single muscle is replaced by a fusiform mass with central liquefaction and peripheral calcification. They can present as enlarging soft tissue masses with clinical features that suggest an enlarging soft-tissue neoplasm or infection.

Laceration:
Laceration of right pectineus muscle with atrophy and scar tissue On the left a patient who met up with the wrong end of a knife. The man was caught by his wife while cheating on her with another woman and he was rewarded with a stab into the groin. This resulted in a laceration of his right pectineus muscle. MR imaging is usually not required for laceration, since these patients usually go directly to the ER or OR for surgical exploration, but this case nicely demonstrates the atrophied muscle and the scar tissue.
Delayed onset muscle soreness:
Delayed onset muscle soreness of gasctrocnemius Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) develops 1-2 days following exercise and resolves in 1-2 weeks (for example after the first days on the ski slopes). DOMS is a type of overuse injury that does not become symptomatic until hours or days after the overuse episode, in contrast with a muscle strain or contusion, which usually is immediately painful. The MR findings show diffuse muscle edema that does not localize to the myotendinous junction and can persist for weeks. On the left a patient who had gone for a run for the first time in quite a while. The muscle is irritated as illustrated by edema in the gastrocnemius (arrows). Because there is a delay in symptoms, patients are not always aware of when or how the injury was actually caused. On the left a navy recruit with delayed onset muscle soreness after weight-lifting. Note the swollen edematous brachialis muscle. These abnormalities can last for weeks.
Fascial hernia:
A fascial tear presents as a mass, the signal is usually normal (rather like an accessory muscle). The muscle herniates through the fascial defect, protruding upon muscle contraction. It is an intermittent mass and can be missed on MR if it is only visible during contraction. A fascial tear is a typical sports injury and most commonly involves the calf (figure). This type of muscle injury is well evaluated with ultrasound, because it is an dynamic examination. David A. May et al October 2000 RadioGraphics, 20, S295-S315.

TNM classification 8th edition:
Onno Mets and Robin Smithuis
Department of Radiology of the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam and the Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2017-12-09 This is a summary of the 8th Edition of TNM in Lung Cancer, which is the standard of non-small cell lung cancer staging since January 1st, 2017. It is issued by the IASLC (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) and replaces the TNM 7th edition.
TNM-8:
TNM-staging 8th edition. Changes to 7th edition in red. The 8th edition of the TNM classification for non-small lung cancer is shown in the table. Conform previous editions there are three components that describe the anatomic extent of the tumor: T for the extent of the primary tumor, N for lymph node involvement, and M for metastatic disease. T-classification is performed using CT, the N- and M-classification using CT and PET-CT. It can be used in the pre-operative imaging and clinical classification iTNM/cTNM, but it is also applicable for definitive pathological staging pTNM, re-staging after therapy yTNM and staging of a recurrence rTNM. Differences with the 7th edition are presented in red.
What is new in the TNM 8th edition:
In the new TNM 8th edition the size went down for several T-categories, and some new pathology based categories were introduced. Also, new M-categories were introduced regarding extrathoracic metastatic disease. Size of a solid lesion is defined as maximum diameter in any of the three orthogonal planes in lung window. In subsolid lesions T-classification is defined by the diameter of the solid component and not the diameter of the complete groundglass lesion. Stages of lung cancer adapted from the 8th Edition of TNM in Lung Cancer
Non-small lung cancer stages:
Subsets of T, N and M categories are grouped into certain stages, because these patients share similar prognosis [1]. For example cT1N0 disease (stage IA) has a 5-year survival of 77-92%. On the other end of the spectrum is any M1c disease (stage IVB) that has a 5-year survival of 0%. Lungcancer with evident transfissural growth on both the coronal and sagittal reconstructions; lobectomy is no longer possible. Lobectomy is generally not possible if there is: These are specific items to report. Thin-slice images and three-plane reconstructions are necessary to best demonstrate the relation with surrounding structures. In case of indeterminate invasion, the multidisciplinary oncology board should decide whether the benefit of doubt is given, depending on the individual case and co-morbidity.
T-classification:

T0:

Tis:
This can only be diagnosed after resection of the tumor. T1 tumor – A typical T1 tumor in the left lower lobe, completely surrounded by pulmonary parenchyma.
T1:
Tumor size ≤3cm T1a(mi) is pathology proven 'minimally invasive', irrespective of size. T1a(ss) is a superficial spreading tumor in the central airways, irrespective of location. T2 tumor - A typical T2 tumor with atelectasis/pneumonitis of the left lower lobe up to the hilum, due to involvement of the left main bronchus.
T2:
T2a= >3 to 4cm T2b= >4 to 5cm T3 tumor - A typical T3 tumor in the right upper lobe with invasion of the chest wall.
T3:
T4 tumor – A typical T4 tumor in the right upper lobe with invasion of the mediastinum.

N - Staging:
Adapted from the American Thoracic Society mapping scheme
Regional Lymph Node Classification System:
Lymph node staging is done according to the American Thoracic Society mapping scheme. Supraclavicular nodes Superior mediastinal nodes Inferior Mediastinal nodes Aortic nodes Subcarinal nodes Inferior Mediastinal nodes Pulmonary nodes The boundary between level 10 and level 4 is on the right the lower border of the azygos vein and on the left the upper border of the pulmonary artery (N1 vs. N2). There is an important separation to be made between level 1 and level 2/3 nodes, because it is N3-stage versus N2. The lower border of level 1 is the clavicles bilaterally and, in the midline, the upper border of the manubrium. The boundary between level 4R and 4L is the left lateral border of the trachea, and not the anatomic midline. Paracardial, internal mammarian, diaphragmatic, axillary and intercostal lymph nodes are not described in the IALSC lymph node map. Occasionally these can be present. It is proposed to regard these non-regional nodes as metastastic disease [2]. CT is unrealiable in staging lymph nodes in patients with NSCLC regardless of the threshold size that is chosen. PET-CT is much more reliable in determining the N-status. False-positives occur in patients with sarcoid, tuberculosis and other infections. Because of the high negative predictive value, PET scanning should be performed in all patients considered for surgery. T2 tumor (> 3cm) in the right lower lobe with ipsilateral hilar node (N1)
N1 - Nodes:
N1-nodes are ipsilateral nodes within the lung up to hilar nodes. N1 alters the prognosis but not the management. N2-disease – Right sided tumor with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes
N2 - Nodes:
N2-nodes represent ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymphadenopathy. There is only a subset of patients with N2 disease that benefits from resection. Those are the patients who -after a negative mediastinoscopy- are found to have microscopic metastatic disease at the time of thoracotomy. These patients have a better prognosis than those with evident N2-disease. N3-stage disease.
N3 - Nodes:
N3-nodes represent contralateral mediastinal or contralateral hilar lymphadenopathy or any scalene or supraclavicular nodes. These are irresectable. For a tumor in the right lung the N-stages are: N1Ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes 10R-14R N2Ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes 2R, 3aR, 3p, 4R, 7, 8R, 9R N3Contralateral mediastinal and/or hilar, as well as any supraclavicular lymph nodes 1, 2L, 3aL, 4L, 5, 6, 8L, 9L, 10L-14L For a tumor in the left lung the N-stages are: N1Ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes 10L-14L N2Ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes 2L, 3aL, 4L, 5, 6, 7, 8L, 9L N3Contralateral mediastinal and/or hilar, as well as any supraclavicular lymph nodes 1, 2R, 3aR, 3pR, 4R, 8R, 9R, 10-14R
M-Staging:
Almost every organ may be involved in metastatic disease. Common are adrenal, nodal, brain, bone and liver involvement. M-staging in the current edition is based on the presence of metastases, their location and multiplicity. A distinction is made between regional metastatic disease (M1a) and solitary (M1b) or multiple (M1c) distant metastatic disease: M1: Distant metastases The Eighth Edition Lung Cancer Stage Classiï¬cation.

Cardiovascular Pearls on Chest CT:
Onno Mets¹ and Robin Smithuis²
¹Radiology department of the University Medical Center Amsterdam and ²Alrijne hospital in Leiden, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2023-12-31 The primary focus of chest-CT is often on the pulmonary
parenchyma and associated pathology. However, beyond the pulmonary domain, chest CT also provides
valuable insights into the cardiovascular system, although it is frequently
beyond the scope of imaging indication. Due to the wealth of information on non-cardiac chest CT
scans, there is a risk of oversight for those not specifically trained in or
focused on cardiovascular
radiology. In this article we provide a systematic diagnostic approach
to the heart and vessels, and we will discuss the following helpful tools: 'Go with the
flow' - a more systematic approach to study the cardiovascular structures as blood flows
towards the right
atrium and eventually leaves the left
ventricle. Introduction
Introduction:

Five Corner approach:
Detecting vascular anomalies on non-cardiac chest CT scans can be
challenging, especially when they are not suspected and therefore not the primary focus of the examination.
By just checking five corners it is possible to detect the vast majority of vascular variants:
Go with the flow:
An easy way to study the cardiovascular structures is to use the  ‘go-with-the-flow’ method. 
This evaluates
 the structures transferring the blood as it enters through
 the caval veins, through the right side of the
 heart into the pulmonary arteries, that carry the blood to the lungs. 
Then the blood travels back
 through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium and ventricle to enter the aorta and major branches including the coronary arteries. Look for the following abnormalities:
SVC and IVC:

Azygos continuation of the inferior vena cava:
In this variant there is absence of the infrahepatic portion of the IVC with the infrarenal and renal segments draining via an enlarged azygos vein into the superior caval vein. 
The supra-hepatic segment of the IVC is present but drains only blood from the hepatic veins into the right atrium. Azygos continuation of the inferior caval vein is normally an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients, although it might be associated with other cardiovascular abnormalities, as well as with splenic absence or polysplenia.
The importance of not overlooking this condition lies mainly in its relevance for surgical planning as well as endovascular procedures, as it prevents catheterizing the right heart from inferior.

Persistent left superior vena cava:
This is the most common thoracic venous anomaly and may be seen either
in isolation or as component of more
complex congenital pathology. The vein begins at the confluens of the left
subclavian and internal jugular vein, passes through the left side of the
mediastinum adjacent to the arcus aorta, and typically drains into the
right atrium via the coronary sinus. For a vessel in this location, lateral to the
aortic arch, there is a differential diagnosis of four:
Levo-atrial cardinal vein:
A rare vascular anomaly that some consider a left-sided
SVC connecting to the left atrium is the levo-atrial cardinal vein (LACV).
However, one may argue its behavior is more on the anomalous pulmonary venous return spectrum. Although
in levo-atrial cardinal vein, the pulmonary veins drain normally into the left atrium, there
is an anomalous venous connection between the left atrium and
left brachiocephalic vein, creating a left-to-right shunt. Due to its location a levo-atrial cardinal vein may easily be misinterpreted for
a left-sided superior caval vein, however,
a left SVC should connect to the coronary
sinus and right atrium and just
represents a venous variant and not a cardiovascular shunt. Simply check the drainage site to differentiate these two.
Left superior intercostal vein - Aortic nipple:
A mimicker of a
vascular variant lateral to the aortic arch is the left superior
intercostal vein. This is a normal venous structure considered part of the hemi-azygos system, and is sometimes more prominent than in others depending on collateral flow. 
Due to
its location it may suggest an anomalous pulmonary venous return, left-sided SVC or levo-atrial cardinal vein, however, assessment of the origin and course of the vascular structure will help separate this
normal venous structure from the above mentioned differential diagnoses of vascular
anomalies. Images
Prominent
left superior intercostal vein, sometimes referred to as ‘aortic
nipple’.
Notice te resemblence to the levo-artial cardinal vein (on the axial view).
Right side of the heart:

Tricuspid valve:
The majority of cases of right-sided infective endocarditis involve the tricuspid valve and are associated with intravenous drug use. In addition to intravenous drug users, patients with hemodialysis catheters, pacemakers, and defibrillator leads are also at increased risk for tricuspid valve infective endocarditis. Image

Right heart dilatation:
The right atrium generally dilates due to
tricuspid valvular disease, which may be primary or secondary to right
ventricular pathology. The right ventricle can be dilated due to various
reasons, either in acute setting or more chronically. 
In the acute setting
massive thrombo-embolic disease may lead to outflow obstruction and ballooning
of the right ventricle, which is inversely related to morbidity and mortality. More chronically, RV dilation can be seen in right-sided cardiomyopathy, congential abnormalities, and pulmonary hypertension due to various etiologies, including chronic thrombo-embolic disease.
Adaptation and remodelling of the right ventricle shows a spectrum of dilation, hypertrophy and eventually failure.
Right heart failure will lead to ascites and body edema, in contrast to left heart failure which leads to congestion with pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Image

Pulmonary Arteries:
Dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) may reflect
primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension. As in aortic dimensions, size may differ between patients
based on multiple factors, such as sex, age, BSA, etc. 
In the general population with a low risk of pulmonary hypertension, main pulmonary artery diameter > 34 mm, or a
MPA-to-Aorta ratio >1.1, should be reported as dilated. In high risk populations with predisposing factors such as
left heart disease, COPD, systemic sclerosis etc. the threshold lowers to >
30 mm, or an MPA-to-Aorta ratio > 0.9. When a dilation of the pulmonary artery is seen this should trigger the search for markers of possible etiology, within the study limitations of non-cardiac chest CT.
This can help in recommending additional imaging modalities, as well as referral to the correct clinician. Dilation may for example be caused by underlying chronic pulmonary emboli, congestion due to left heart disease, fibrotic and other severe lung disease, or due to a left-to-right-shunt in a vascular anomaly. ImageDilated pulmonary artery of 38 mm due to a cardiovascular left-to-right shunt (ie. PAPVR).
Pulmonary Veins:

Anomalous pulmonary venous return:
This figure is shown before. By checking these five corners it is possible to detect the vast majority of vascular variants, and is especially helpful to detect pulmonary venous anomalies (in bold): Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Anomalous pulmonary venous return (2)Normally the oxygenated blood runs from all lung lobes to the
left atrium through several pulmonary veins.
Although number and size of pulmonary veins may vary between patients, site of drainage should not.
In abnormal pulmonary venous return there is drainage into
the systemic circulation rather than into the left atrium, creating a
left-to-right shunt. Drainage can either be supracardiac (eg. caval
vein), cardiac (eg. right atrium), infracardiac (eg. IVC) or mixed (ie.
combination of the above). In adults there is most often a partial anomalous return (PAPVR) as
compared to total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), which is a severe
congenital abnormality that is not incidentally found on chest CT later in life. The impact
the anomaly has on the right
side of the heart, as well as presence of symptoms such as dyspnea, depend on the shunt
fraction. If small, a PAPVR may prove to be a clinically
irrelevant finding. In PAPVR most often the left upper lobe drains into the left
brachiocephalic vein.The next most common anomaly is the right upper lobe draining into the
superior caval vein. 
A right-sided PAPVR has a strong association with a sinus venosus defect
(approx. 40%), wich is an atrial septal defect at the location of the
cavo-atrial junction. One should thus check for the presence of this type of
ASD when a right PAPVR is seen. ImagesThis patient was scheduled
for right upper lobe lobectomy for lung cancer and the vascular anomaly was

implications of such an anomaly underline the importance of not overlooking
such variants. Enable Scroll

A scimitar vein is a PAPVR of the right lung draining infracardially, most often into the IVC. ImagesPAPVR of the right lower lobe, draining blood into the IVC. This is also known as a Scimitar vein, due to its resemblance to a certain type of sword.
Left Atrium and Appendage:

Dilatation of Left Atrium:
Left
atrial dilation is a very common finding and most often related to atrial fibrillation
and mitral valvular heart disease. 
Dilation of the left atrium may coincide
with arrhythmias and cloth formation, increasing the risk for embolic events. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll
Thrombus:
The most common intracardiac mass is a thrombus, which is often
located in the left atrial appendage (LAA), predominantly in patients with atrial
fibrillation and significant dilation. 
Nevertheless, thrombus may also be seen in the right atrium in relation to a
central venous catheter or in a left ventricle apical aneurysm after prior
myocardial infarction. Scroll through the images of a patient with atrial fibrillation.
What are the findings? Images
The left atrium is dilated.
There is a thrombus in the left atrial appendage (arrow) extending towards the left atrium (arrowhead). In the left atrial appendage there is often the imaging differential of a thrombus or incomplete opacification due to slow-flow, especially in early contrast phase imaging.
This might be solved with CT in a later contrast phase or acquisition in the prone position.Transesophageal cardiac ultrasound is considered the gold standard. Images

left atrial appendage, with inital incomplete opacification of the LAA but

Myxoma:
A myxoma is a relatively rare benign tumor, but one of the commonest primary cardiac masses.
It usually originates in the atrium, mostly on the left side. 
It is often pedunculated and attached to the interatrial septum.
They are heterogeneously low attenuating and calcification may be seen.
Depending on the size it may lead to valvular obstruction, prolapse and systemic embolic events. Image

Cor triatriatum:
In cor triatriatum the atrium is divided into two compartments by a fibromuscular membrane.
The membrane is more commonly seen in the left atrium. 
The severity of clinical symptoms depends on the size of the fenestration in the membrane.
Less severe cases may go undetected for a long time. Image

Left Ventricle:

Dilatation:
The
left ventricle can be dilated due to various reasons, but most commonly due to
dilated cardiomyopathy, or post-infarction ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
Decreased
systolic function of the left ventricle will lead to congestion, with left
atrial dilation, pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. In the chronic situation, left heart disease and longstanding congestion may result in increased pressure on the right side of the heart, and eventually
cause pulmonary hypertension. This image is of a female trauma patient, who presented with an intracranial hemorrhage. Image
Incidentally found severely dilated left ventricle.
The transverse LV diameter is > 70 mm.
Hypertrophy:
Myocardial dimensions are influenced by the time of acquisition,
as in systole the myocardium will appear thicker than in diastole. Nevertheless myocardial
hypertrophy should be suggested when thickness exceeds 20-25 mm.
Left
ventricular hypertrophy may either be concentric of asymmetrical: Multiplanar
reconstructions can help to asses morphology of the myocardial hypertrophy, and
suggest possible underlying etiology. ImageConcentric left ventricular hypertrophy in chronic
hypertensionmeasuring up to 26 mm at the basal septum.
This is abnormal even in systole.
Myocardial infarction:
A prior myocardial infarction may go undetected and signs of
such an event can incidentally be found on non-cardiac
chest CT. Typically CT shows myocardial thinning with or without fatty
replacement, which is seen as a hypodense subendocardial line. Image
Subendocardial fibro-fatty replacement after a prior infarction in the LAD territory. In the acute phase of a myocardial infarction a perfusion defect may be seen on contrast-enhanced chest CT as hypodense attenuation in a coronary territory. 
This may present in scenarios where the patient's initial presentation is related to trauma – such as a traffic accident or fall from stairs – and the triggering cardiac issue is initially overlooked. 
This scenario underscores the importance of a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular abnormalities in the early detection of unsuspected pathology. ImagePerfusion defect in LAD territory of 45 year old trauma patient, who presented after a fall from the stairs during heavy lifting.
A sharper window setting helps to assess the myocardial attenuation differences.
Aneurysm of the left ventricle:
Aneurysmatic dilation of the left ventricular may develop
post-infarction, and sometimes shows wall
calcification. Check for signs of an intracardiac thrombus in these cases,
as this can result in systemic emboli. Image Post myocardial infarction in LAD territory with apical
aneurysm formation, wall calcification and a large intraventricular thrombus.

Aorta:

Aortic dilatation:
The suggested cut-off values for defining an aortic aneurysm are 50 mm for the ascending and 40 mm for the descending aorta, with normal values approximately capped at 40 and 30 mm, respectively.
Values between normal and aneurysmatic should be considered dilated. 
However, aortic size varies among patients, and individual values differ based on factors like age, sex, and body surface area. 
Also, acknowledging the potential challenges in measurement accuracy due to factors like movement in non-ECG triggered CT imaging is important. 
Nevertheless, taking into consideration the above mentioned margins of error it is important not to miss a significantly dilated aorta as there is increased risk of rupture, particularly in patients with a proximal aorta size exceeding 55 mm. 
The threshold of determining the need for surgical intervention is lower in patients with known connective-tissue diseases such as Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos. ImageSevere aneurysmatic dilation of aortic sinus and ascending
aorta. When a dilated proximal aorta is seen, this should trigger
more thorough evaluation of possibly associated
abnormalities such as aortic valve stenosis
or bicuspid aortic valve. Image
Bicuspid aortic valve. From reference 1
Aortic valve calcification:
Aortic valve calcification is most often caused by calcific
degeneration and is therefore increasingly seen in older patients. In younger
patients a bicuspid aortic valve should be high in the differential diagnosis. The extent of aortic valve calcifications correlate with the
severity of aortic stenosis. It is recommended to visually quantify aortic valve calcification as mild, moderate and
severe (figure). A recommendation can be included in the radiology report (see Figure). If aortic valve calcification is identified, study the dimensions of the aortic root and ascending aorta. Calcification may also occur elsewhere in the heart, including at the mitral valve or annulus, and in the pericardium. However, in many cases these are findings without clinical significance and require no recommendation in the report impression.
Papillary fibroelastoma of the Aortic valve:
Non-ECG gated chest CT does not visualize the cardiac valves well, however, sometimes abnormalities can be seen.
As discussed above, main valvular incidental findings will be aortic valve and mitral calcification. A rare finding is a papillary fibroelastoma (arrow), which is the commonest primary tumor in relation to the cardiac valves, mainly in relation to the aortic or mitral valve. The typical CT finding of a PFE is a small irregular pedunculated mass in relation
to the heart valve. Most often it is an asymptomatic incidental finding, although a
papillary fibroelastoma can be complicated by systemic embolic events. Right Aortic Arch with an aberrant left subclavian. View from anterior.
Aortic arch and branch variants:
Anomalies of the aorta and branches are discussed in the article 'Vascular Anomalies of Aorta, Pulmonary and Systemic vessels' by Marilyn J. Siegel and Robin Smithuis.
Aortic diverticulum:
An aortic diverticulum is usually seen at the site of the isthmus where the ductal remnant or ligamentum arteriosum attaches. 
Because this is also the location where the majority of traumatic aortic injuries is seen, it is sometimes mistaken for a pseudo-aneurysm. 
A diverticulum shows more obtuse angles, often a more beak-like appearance and calcification may be present. Contrarily to an aortic injury, a diverticulum shows no irregularity and no surrounding infiltration or fluid. Just distal to the level of the isthmus the aorta may show a more diffuse bulging, which is known as an aortic spindle. This is also a clinically irrelevant variant. ImagesExamples of an aortic diverticulum (left), an aortic splindle (middle), and traumatic aortic injury at the level of the isthmus.
Aortic branches including coronaries:

Aberrant right subclavian artery:
Also known as Lusoria artery, this is the most common aortic arch anomaly. Instead of being the first branch, the right subclavian artery originates distal to the left subclavian artery as the fourth branch. It then runs back towards the right side, its course variable in relation to the esophagus and trachea. In the majority of cases it runs posterior to the esophagus, but sometimes between the trachea and esophagus, or rarely even anterior to the trachea. Normally asymptomatic, it might result in trachea-esophageal symptoms, mainly dysphagia. ImagesAberrant right subclavian artery with a retro-esophageal course. Here a dilated aberrant right suclavian artery.
Notice the take off from the aorta behind the trachea and esophagus.
The dilatation results in swallowing problems due to obstruction of the esophagus.
Hypertrophy of bronchial arteries:
The bronchial arteries deliver oxygenated blood under
systemic pressure to the supporting structures of the lung, including the
pulmonary arteries. Although variation occurs, they
origin from the descending aorta mostly at the level of the fifth thoracic
vertebra. 
Bronchial arteries are small and often not easily depicted. When enlarged and sufficiently opacified they may be seen on chest CT.
Bronchial artery hypertrophy can be seen for
example in severe parenchymal disease and chronic thrombo-embolic
pulmonary hypertension. ImagesHypertrophy of the bronchial artery up to 4 mm in diameter (arrows) with a small aneurysm (arrowhead). Click on the image to see the jet
Persistent ductus arteriosus:
The ductus arteriosus runs between the inferior aortic arch
at the level of the isthmus and the proximal left pulmonary artery. Before birth it allows blood to bypass the non-ventilated
lungs in a physiologic right-to-left shunt. The ductus normally closes in the early postnatal period. Contrarily to the prenatal situation, a persistent ductus
after birth results in a left-to-right shunt with blood flowing from the
high-pressure systemic circulation into the low-pressure pulmonary artery. 
This
leads to lung overcirculation and left heart volume overload. The severity of the condition depends on the size of the shunt fraction. Patency of the ductus may be isolated or associated with
other cardiac anomalies. ImagesIncidental patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with a jet of less opacified blood (arrows) into the pulmonary artery.
Arch vessels:
The arch
vessels can easily be assessed for proximal obstruction on contrast-enhanced CT
imaging. 
Depending on which vessel is compromised this may have clinical
implications regarding perfusion of the brain (ie. carotids) or the upper
extremities (ie. subclavian arteries). Image Severe atherosclerosis in the proximal left
subclavian artery.
Proximal subclavian occlusion or severe flow obstruction may
explain a left-to-right difference in blood pressure, and is important
information for example to prevent a clinical suspicion for aortic dissection later in life. Enable Scroll

Sequestration:
In pulmonary sequestration there is a systemic arterial
supply of the involved segment of the lung. This lung segment is not aerated and has per
definition no normal connection to the bronchial tree and pulmonary
arterial system. ImagesSystemic arterial supply to the left lower lobe in pulmonary sequestration. Sometimes part of the lung parenchyma is supplied by a
systemic artery, either solely (ie. isolated) or in conjunction with normal pulmonary arterial supply (ie. dual
supply), while the bronchial anatomy and aeration of the involved lung segment is normal. 
This
condition is named anomalous systemic arterial supply of the normal lung. This is often an asymptomatic finding, but some
patients can develop focal hypertension with signs of congestion and
haemoptysis. 
This may require surgical or endovascular intervention. ImagesIncidental anomalous systemic arterial supply of the normal posterobasal segment of the right lower lobe, without pulmonary sequastration. Note the subtle signs of congestion in the involved segment of the right lower lobe.
Aberrant coronary arteries:
Large variation in origin and course of the coronary arteries exists. 
Most are benign variants, but a proximal interarterial and intramural course (mostly RCA from left coronary cusp) is believed to carry an increased risk of ischemia, infarction and sudden cardiac death.
Within study limitations of non-cardiac chest CT one can check origin and proximal course of the coronaries to detect abnormalities. Image

Bladder volume:
Material and methodA total of 3376 children were recruited in this ultrasonographic study. The total number of patients does not add up to the total number of patients in this study because not all age-subgroups were included in the table. The bladder volume was calculated first by measuring the maximum length (L) of the urinary bladder on the longitudinal scan, which was obtained from the neck to the fundus of the bladder. Depth (D) was measured, perpendicular to the first plane at the level of the maximum area, in the midline from the anterior to posterior mucosal surface of the bladder. The width (W) was taken perpendicular to D at its mid-point. Bladder volume as presented in the table was recalculated from the data in this study using the equation for an ellipsoïd: L×D×W (in centimetres) x 0.523. Adapted from reference 17
Bladder wall thickness:
Materials and method: A total of 3376 children were recruited. Bladder wall thickness was only measured when the residual bladder volume was <10% of the original volume. Causes of bladder wall thickening: The bladder wall thickness was measured from a zoomed image of the transverse plane of the voided bladder at 3 points: anterolaterally, laterally and posterolaterally (figure). The mean was taken for these three measurements. The bladder wall thickness depends on the degree of filling of the bladder and its capacity. Therefore the bladder wall thickness is expressed as the bladder volume wall thickness index (BVWI).

Anterior recess:
Materials and method Ultrasonographic study of 58 healthy children and 105 children with unilateral transient synovitis (age range 1.7-12.8 years). The children were examined in the supine position with hips in neutral position. Adapted from reference 22 The children are examined in the supine position with hips in neutral position. The anterior joint capsule was measured, including both of its components (the anterior and posterior layer). Also the anterior contour of the joint casule is evaluated. There was no statistically significant correlation between age and thickness of the anterior joint capsule. A difference >2mm or an effusion >2mm is considered abnormal.

Children:
Materials and method These ultrasonography studies comprised of 512 healthy children - 238 boys and 274 girls - with ages ranging from 1 day (full-term neonate) to 17 years and 96 premature infants with gestational ages from 25-35 weeks. None of the children had a problem that could affect spleen size. Ultrasonography was performed using standard probes matched for age. Causes of splenomegaly: The measurement of spleen length is the optically maximal distance -ideally at the hilum - on the longitudinal coronal view between the most superomedial and the most inferolateral points (figure).
Kidney volume:
Material and method A total of 3376 children were recruited in this ultrasonographic study. Kidney volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula as Length x Width x Depth x 0.523. In this study, the total renal volume was obtained by adding together both kidney volumes but without mentioning the separate values for the left and right kidney. The values in the table were obtained by dividing the total renal volume by two. Ultrasonographic measurement of the length, width an depth of a kidney.

Doppler values:
Materials and MethodOne-hundred ultrasound examinations performed in 100 healthy children aged 0–17.9 years (median 7.8 years, interquartile range 1.1–14.1 years) were included. Reference values for the hepatic hilum portal vein peak systolic velocity, hepatic artery peak systolic velocity, and hepatic artery resistive index in children were established (reference). Portal vein peak systolic velocity is not age-dependent, whereas hepatic artery peak systolic velocity and hepatic artery resistive index decrease when children get older.
Mesenteric lymph nodes:
Adapted from reference 15 Materials and method In this retrospective study in 61 children (36 boys and 25 girls, mean age 10.7 years, range 1.1-17.3 years) who underwent non-contrast abdominal CT examination for evaluation of suspected or known renal stones abdominal lymph node size was evaluated. It is assumed that these CT findings can be extrapolated to ultrasonography. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (short axis > 5 mm) were found in 33 (54%) of the 61 children. The majority of the enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were found in the right lower quadrant (88%). Based on their findings the authors state that: using a short-axis diameter of >8 mm might be a more appropriate definition for mesenteric lymphadenopathy in children. False-positive rate for enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with varying lymph node threshold size is seen in the table. Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes:

Pancreas:
Adapted from reference 12 Materials and method Two hundred and seventy-three patients (differentiation in sex not mentioned) were included in this retrospective ultrasonography study. The maximum anteroposterior (AP) diameters of the head, body and tail of the pancreas were measured on transverse/oblique images. Echogenicity was low in 27 (10%), isoechoic in 145 (53%) and high in 101 (37%). The maximum anteroposterior (AP) diameters of the head, body and tail of the pancreas were measured on transverse/oblique images. Causes of enlargement of the pancreas:
Portal vein:
Adapted from reference 9 Materials and method One hundred and fifty children aged 0-16 years, without clinical evidence of liver or intestinal disease, which were referred for abdominal ultrasound were included in the study. Measurement of portal vein diameter The portal vein is visualized in the longitudinal axis from the splenomesenteric junction to the liver hilum. The greatest anteroposterior diameter is measured at the site where the hepatic artery crosses the portal vein.

Thymus:
Adapted from reference 22 Materials and method Mediastinal ultrasonography was performed in 151 infants (79 boys and 72 girls). All children were healthy and had no stress factors affecting their thymic size. Causes of enlarged thymus: The maximum transverse diameter, right lobe anteroposterior, left lobe anteroposterior. Perpendicular to the transverse plane the longest craniocaudal dimension (length) is assessed. The thymic index was calculated by multiplying the transverse diameter (a) by the largest sagittal area (b).

Elbow fractures in Children:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology department, Rijnland Hospital Leiderdorp, the Netherlands.:
Publicationdate 2008-12-01 Elbow fractures are the most common fractures in children. The assessment of the elbow can be difficult because of the changing anatomy of the growing skeleton and the subtility of some of these fractures. In this review important signs of fractures and dislocations of the elbow will be discussed. Before reading this article you can try one of the cases in the menubar. You can test your knowledge on pediatric elbow fractures with these interactive cases. On some of the images you can click to get a larger view.

Hyperextension:
Injury to the elbow joint is usely the result of hyperextension or extreme valgus due to a fall on the outstretched arm. Scroll through the images on the left to see how hyperextension leads to a supracondylar fracture. The hemarthros will result in a displacement of the anterior fat pad upwards and the posterior fat backwards. Enable Scroll

Extreme valgus:
The other important fracture mechanism is extreme valgus of the elbow. The normal elbow already has a valgus positioning. When a child falls on the outstrechted arm, this can lead to extreme valgus. On the lateral side this can result in a dislocation or a fracture of the radius with or without involvement of the olecranon. When the forces have more effect on the humerus, the extreme valgus will result in a fracture of the lateral condyle. On the medial side the valgus force can lead to avulsion of the medial epicondyle. Sometimes the medial epicondyl becomes trapped within the joint. Because of the valgus position of the normal elbow an avulsion of the lateral epicondyle will be uncommon.
Radiological Interpretation:

Methodical review:
When looking at radiographs of the elbow after trauma a methodical review of the radiographs is needed . You should ask yourself the following important questions. Is there a sign of joint effusion? After trauma this almost always indicates the presence of hemarthros due to a fracture (either visible or occult). Is there a normal alignment between the bones? In children dislocations are frequent and can be very subtle. Are the ossification centres normal? Is the piece of bone that you're looking at a normal ossification centre and is this ossification centre in the normal position. . Look especially for the position of the radial epiphysis and the medial epicondyle (figure). Is there a subtle fracture? Some of the fractures in children are very subtle. 
So you need to be familiar with the typical picture of these fractures. . Normal anterior fat pad.
Fat Pad Sign and Joint effusion:
Normally on a lateral view of the elbow flexed in 90? a fat pad is seen on the anterior aspect of the joint . This is normal fat located in the joint capsule. On the posterior side no fat pad is seen since the posterior fat is located within the deep intercondylar fossa. Positive fat pad sign both anteriorly as well as posteriorly. Positive fat pad sign Distention of the joint will cause the anterior fat pad to become elevated and the posterior fat pad to become visible. An elevated anterior lucency or a visible posterior lucency on a true lateral radiograph of an elbow flexed at 90? is described as a positive fat pad sign (figure). Hemarthros results in an upward displacement of the anterior fat pad and a backward displacement the posterior fat. Positive Anterior Fat Pad sign. On digital radiographs you may need to adjust the window width and level to appreciate this. No fracture was visible on the X-rays. Positive fat pad sign (2)
Any elbow joint distention either hemorrhagic, inflammatory or traumatic gives rise to a positive fat pad sign. If a positive fat pad sign is not present in a child, significant intra-articular injury is unlikely. A visible fat pad sign without the demonstration of a fracture should be regarded as an occult fracture. These patients are treated as having a nondisplaced fracture with 2 weeks splinting. Skaggs et al repeated x-rays after three weeks in patients with a positive posterior fat pad sign but no visible fracture. They found evidence of fracture in 75%. They concluded that in trauma displacement of the posterior fat pad is virtually pathognomonic of the presence of a fracture. Displacement of the anterior fat pad alone however can occur due to minimal joint effusion and is less specific for fracture. Notice that the elbow is not positioned well. Try to find out what went wrong in the chapter on positioning.
Alignment:
There are two important lines which help in the diagnosis of dislocation and fracture . These are the Radiocapitellar line and the Anterior humeral line. Radiocapitellar line
A line drawn through the centre of the radial neck should pass throught the centre of the capitellum, whatever the positioning of the patient, since the radius articulates with the capitellum (figure). In dislocation of the radius this line will not pass through the centre of the capitellum. On the left we see, that the radiocapitellar line goes through centre of the capitellum on every radiogragh even though C and D are not well positioned. Notice supracondylar fracture in B. On the left more examples of the radiocapitellar line. The right lower image shows an obvious dislocation of the radius. Radiographs of elbows at different ages. The Anterior Humeral line goes through the middle third of the capitellum . Anterior humeral line. A line drawn on a lateral view along the anterior surface of the humerus should pass through the middle third of the capitellum.. This line is called the Anterior Humeral line . In cases of a supracondylar fracture the anterior humeral line usually passes through the anterior third
of the capitellum or in front of the capitellum due to posterior bending of the distal humeral fragment. On the left the anterior humeral line passes through the anterior third of the capitellum. This indicates that the condyles are displaced dorsally (i.e. supracondylar fracture). First study the images on the left. Then continue reading. The radiocapitellar line ends above the capitellum. This means that the radius is dislocated. Did you also notice the olecranon fracture? Whenever the radius is fractured or dislocated, always study the ulna carefully. The order of appearance of the ossification centres is specified in the mnemonic C-R-I-T-O-E.
Ossification centres:
There are 6 ossification centres around the elbow joint.
 They appear and fuse to the adjacent bones at different ages. It is important to know the sequence of appearance since the ossification centers always appear in a strict order. This order of appearance is specified in the mnemonic C-R-I-T-O-E
(Capitellum - Radius - Internal or medial epicondyle - Trochlea - Olecranon - External or lateral epicondyle). The ages at which these ossification centres appear are highly variable and differ between individuals. It is not important to know these ages, but as a general guide you could remember 1-3-5-7-9-11 years. Fragmented appearance of the Trochlea in 2 different children. The Trochlea has two or more ossification centres which can give the trochlea a fragmented appearance. Trochlea ossification-fragments simulate loose bodies in the joint On a lateral view the trochlea ossifications may project into the joint. They should not be mistaken for loose intra-articular bodies (arrow).
Radiography:
Shoulder higher than elbow. Radius and Capitellum project on to the ulna.
Common errors in positioning:
Error 1: Shoulder higher than elbow For a true lateral view the shoulder should be at the level of the elbow. If the shoulder is higher than the elbow, the radius and capitellum will project on the ulna. The solution is either to lift the examination table which will lift the elbow or to lower the shoulder by placing the patient on a smaller chair. LEFT: Slight endorotation of the humerus due to a low position of the wrist. RIGHT: More endorotation due to malpositioning. Error 2: Wrist lower than elbow On the left two examples of a 'low wrist positioning' leading to rotation of the humerus. The low position of the wrist leads to endorotation of the humerus. The lateral structures like the capitellum and the radius will move anteriorly, while a medial structure like the medial epicondyle will move posteriorly. The wrist should be higher than the elbow to compensate for the normal valgus position of the elbow. The hand should be with the 'thumb up'.
Elbow fractures:

Supracondylar fractures:
These fractures account for more than 60% of all elbow fractures in children (see Table). More than 95% of supracondylar fractures are hyperextension type due to a fall on the outstretched hand. 
The elbow becomes locked in hyperextension. 
The olecranon is pushed into the olecranon fossa causing the anterior humeral cortex to bend and eventually break. 
If the force continues both the anterior and posterior cortex will fracture. Supracondylar fractures. In A the anterior humeral line passes through the anterior third of the capitellum and in B even more anteriorly. Notice positive posterior fat pad sign in both cases Supracondylar fractures (2)
If there is only minimal or no displacement these fractures can be occult on radiographs. 
The only sign will be a positive fat pad sign. 
Usually there is some displacement and the anterior humeral line will not pass through the centre of the capitellum but through the anterior third or even anterior to the capitellum (figure). Supracondylar fractures (3)
Supracondylar fractures are classified according to Gartland.
Gartland Type I fractures are often difficult to see on X-rays since there is only minimal displacement. 
Most of these fractures consist of greenstick or torus fractures. The only clue to the diagnosis may be a positive fat pad sign. 
These patients are treated with casting. In Gartland type II fractures there is displacement but the posterior cortex is intact. 
There may be some rotation. These fractures require closed reduction and some need percutaneous fixation if a long-arm cast does not adequately hold the reduction. Gartland type III fracture Gartland type III fractures are completely dislocated and are at risk for malunion and neurovascular complications (figure). They require reduction by closed or if necessary open means. Stabilisation is maintained with either two lateral pins or medial lateral cross pin technique. Gartland III fracture with medial-lateral cross pin technique. After reduction there is inadequate correction of medial collaps. After two months there is malunion with cubitus varus deformity. Supracondylar fractures (4)
Malunion will result in the classic 'gunstock' deformity due to rotation or inadequate correction of medial collaps. Posterolateral displacement of the distal fragment can be associated with injurie to the neurovascular bundle which is displaced over the medial metaphyseal spike. Nerve injurie almost always results in neuropraxis that resolves in 3-4 months. Vascular injurie usually results in a pulseless but pink hand. 
Conservative management and vascular intervention have the same outcome. 
A pulseless and white hand after reduction needs exploration. Flexion-type supracondylar fracture caused by direkt impact Supracondylar fractures (5) Flexion-type fractures are uncommon (5% of all supracondylar fractures). 
They are caused by direct impact on the flexed elbow.
 Ulnar nerve injury is more common. 
Compared to extension types, they are more likely to be unstable, so more likely to require fixation.
Lateral Condyle fractures:
This fracture is the second most common distal humerus fracture in children. They occur between the ages of 4 and 10 years. These fractures occur when a varus force is applied to the extended elbow. They tend to be unstable and become displaced because of the pull of the forearm extensors. Since these fractures are intra-articular they are prone to nonunion because the fracture is bathed in synovial fluid. Lateral condyle fractures are classified according to Milch. They are Salter-Harris IV epiphysiolysis fractures. Most are Milch II fractures that travel from the lateral humeral metaphysis above the epiphysis and exit through the lateral crista of the trochlea leading to an unstable humeral ulnar articulation. Lateral Condyle fractures (2) The problem with the Milch-classification is the fact that the fracture fragments are primarily cartilaginous. The fracture line through the cartilage is not visible on radiographs, so the radiographic interpretation concerning classification is difficult.
Treatment strategies are therefore based on the amount of displacement (see Table). Undisplaced fractures are treated with a long arm cast.
These fractures must be carefully monitored as they have a tendency to displace. At follow up both AP and Oblique views are taken after removal of the cast. 
Once displaced fractures consolidate in a malunited position, treatment is difficult and fraught with complications.
For this reason surgical reductions is recommended within the first 48 hours. Open reduction is indicated for all displaced fractures and those demonstrating joint instability. Lateral Condyle fractures (3) .
The diagnosis of a lateral condyle fracture can be challenging. Fracture lines are sometimes barely visible (figure). Remembering the fact that the lateral condyle fracture is the second most common elbow-fracture in children and because you know where to look for will help you Lateral condyle fracture. On the x-ray only a small metaphyseal fragment is visible. The detatched fragment however is larger than it appears on the radiograph. The fracture extents into the lateral ridge of the trochlea. Elbow is probably unstable. Lateral Condyle fractures (4) . Since most of the structures involved are cartilageneous, it is very difficult to know the exact extent of the fracture. CT reconstruction of displaced lateral condyle fracture. Humeroulnar joint is stable. Sometimes the fracture runs through the ossified part of the capitellum. In those cases it is easy. The case on the left shows a lateral condyle fracture extending through the ossified part of the capitellum. This is a Milch I fracture. The elbow is stable. 
There is too much displacement so osteosynthesis has to be performed. MR of lateral condyle fracture. Milch II and unstable elbow. T2 image with fat saturation on the right shows cartilaginous fracture. Fracture-fragment surrounded by synovial fluid. (Courtesy of Lynne Steinbach, M.D. Univ. of California, San Francisco) MRI can be helpfull in depicting the full extent of the cartilaginous component of the fracture. The case on the left shows a fracture extending into the unossified trochlear ridge. The fracture through the trochlear cartilage is so far medial that the ulna is only supported on the medial side. This means that the elbowjoint is unstable. LEFT a subtle lateral condyle fracture. Less than 2 mm displacement and probably stable. RIGHT a different case. Oblique view gives nice impression of fracture. Blue arrow indicates a cleft epiphysis of the radius (normal variant) Lateral Condyle fractures (5) 
In lateral condyle fractures the actual fracture line can be very subtle since the metaphyseal flake of bone may be minor. The fracture fragment is often rotated. An oblique view can be helpfull, but usually these are not routinely performed (figure). Two cases of overprojection of the capitellum on humeral epiphysis simulating a fracture. Notice olecranon fracture on the right Lateral Condyle fractures (6) . Overprojection of the capitellum on the humeral metaphysis may simulate a lateral condyle fracture (figure). Lateral Condyle fractures (7) . On the left a couple of examples of lateral condyle fractures. Capitellum fracture While fractures of the lateral condyle occur in children between the age of 4 -10 years, isolated fractures of the capitellum are seen in children above the age of 12. Capitellum fractures are uncommon. The rotation of the fracture fragment gives a typical appearance on the X-rays (arrow). Normal medial epicondyle projecting posteriorly. Notice radial head dislocation and olecranon fracture
Medial Epicondyle avulsion:
The medial epicondyle is an apophysis since it does not contribute to the longitudinal growth of the humerus. 
It is located on the dorsal side of the elbow. On a lateral view especially if the arm is endorotated it can project so far posteriorly that one could suggest an avulsion (figure). However avulsions are located more distally and anteriorly. Since the medial epicondyle is an extra-articular structure a fracture or avulsion will not automatically produce a positive fat pad sign. Avulsion of medial epicondyle. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (2). 80% of avulsion fractures occur in boys with a peak age in early adolescence. The mechanism is an acute valgus stress due to a fall on the outstretched hand or sometimes due to armwrestling. Chronic injuries do occur in young athletes (little league elbow). The mechanism that causes these stressfractures on the medial side is the same mechanism that causes a osteochondritis of the capitellum due to impaction on the lateral side. Dislocation of the elbow with interposed medial epicondyle. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (3). There is a 50% incidence of associated elbow dislocations. 
When the elbow is dislocated and the medial epicondyle is avulsed,
 it may become interposed between the articular surface of the humerus and the olecranon (figure). In every dislocation the first question should be 'where is the medial epicondyle'. Same case as above. After reduction the epicondyle returned to its normal position (not good visible due to cast) and was fixated with K-wires. On reducing the elbow the fragment may return to it's original position or remain trapped in the joint. 
This may severely damage the articular surface. So post-reduction films should be studied carefully. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (4). Due to the extreme valgus force the joint may temporarily open. 
The avulsed fragment may become entrapped in the joint even when there is no dislocation of the elbow. On AP-view the avulsed medial epicondyle projects over the trochlea. Lateral view shows the fragment to be trapped within the joint. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (5).
An avulsed fragment that is located within the joint can give diagnostic problems. On an AP-view this fragment may be overlooked (figure). When the trochlea is not yet ossified the avulsed fragment may simulate a trochlear ossification centre. Another example of a dislocated elbow with avulsion of the medial epicondyle. In this case the epicondyle is not retracted into the joint. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (6). Treatment Non-displaced fractures are treated with 1-2 weeks cast or splint. 
There is disagreement about the amount of displacement of the medial epicondyle that requires operative fixation. There is support for both operative aswell as non-operative management of medial epicondyle fractures with 5-15mm displacement. Avulsion of the medial epicondyle. The amount of soft tissue swelling on the medial side suggests that the elbow was dislocated. Medial Epicondyle avulsion (7). If the history or the radiographs suggest that the elbow was or is dislocated, greater soft tissue injurie is likely to be present requiring need for early motion.

Click on the image to enlarge The MR shows the small medial epicondyle with tendon attachement trapped within the joint. The avulsed medial epicondyl was found within the joint and repositioned and fixated with K-wires. Subtle radial neck fracture seen only on AP-view.
Proximal fractures of the Radius:
In adults fractures usually involve the articular surface of the radial head.
 In children however it's the radial neck that fractures because the metaphyseal bone is weak due to constant remodelling. 
Usually it is a Salter Harris II fracture. If there is no displacement it can be difficult to make the diagnosis (figure). Radial neck fracture with tilt. Notice trochlear ossifications projecting in between humerus and ulna simulating intra-articular fragments. If there is less than 30? tilt of the radial head patients are treated with a collar. 
It is important to realize that there is normally some angulation of the radial head ( up to 15?). If there is more than 30? tilt closed reduction is performed. After closed reduction radiograph in cast shows unsuccesfull reduction. K-wire insertion is performed Whenever closed reduction is unsuccesfull in restoring tilt or when it is not possible to pronate and supinate up to 60?, a K-wire is inserted to maintain reduction. The radial epiphysis is slipped (arrows). The radiocapitellar line does not pass through the capitellum indicating dislocation and there is a fracture of the olecranon Radial neck fractures aswell as radial head dislocations are in 50% of the cases associated with other elbow injuries. 
The most common is a fracture of the olecranon. When the radial epiphysis is yet very small a slipped radial epiphysis may be overlooked (figure). Same patient as above 4 weeks later If these fractures are not recognized or reduction is unsuccesfull radial head overgrowth can be the result. A short radius may also be the result since the epiphysis of the radius contributes to the length growth of the radius. LEFT: an obvious radial dislocation. No fracture of the ulna (Monteggia) was foundRIGHT: a subtle radial head dislocation. Associated olecranonfracture is seen on carefull inspection
Dislocations of the Radial head:
Dislocations of the radial head can be very obvious.
 It is however not uncommon that these dislocations are subtle and easily overlooked. In all cases one should look for associated injury. 
In the original discription of Monteggia there is a radial dislocation in combination with a proximal ulnar shaft fracture. 
However fractures anywhere along the ulna have been reported. 
Especially associated fractures of the olecranon are very common (figure). Radius Pulled Elbow (Nursemaid's elbow) In children When the forearm is pulled the radial head moves distally and the ligament slips over the radial head and becomes trapped within the joint. The X-ray is normal. The condition is cured by supination of the forearm. Sometimes this happens during positioning for a true lateral view (which is with the forearm in supination). Olecranon fracture indicated by discontinuity of the dorsal cortex. No associated fracture.
Olecranon fractures:
Olecranon fractures in children are less common than in adults. As discussed above they are associated with radial neck fractures and radial dislocations. Normal olecranon ossification centres in a patient with a tilted radial neck fracture. Olecranon fractures (2) Do not mistake the apophysis or its separate ossification centres for a fracture. 
The apophysis has undulating faintly sclerotic margins. 
The growth plate usually has a different oblique course compared to a fracture-line. Olecranon fractures (3) On the left some examples of fractures of the olecranon. Notice how subtle some of these fractures are.

Fractures:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Rijnland Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2008-01-12 Fractures of the distal radius account for one-sixth of all fractures seen in the emergency department. The radiologist must possess an understanding of the factors that alter clinical decision making and patient treatment. In this review we will discuss: Complications Imaging
Imaging:
PA view: wrist and elbow at shoulder heightLateral view: shoulder, elbow and wrist in sagittal plane
Positioning:
PA view should be taken with the wrist and elbow at shoulder height. This means that the wrist, elbow and shoulder are all in the transverse plane, perpendicular to the x-ray beam. Only in this position, the radius and the ulna are parallel. Lowering the arm makes the radius cross the ulna and become relatively shorter resulting in improper measurement of the length of the radius. Lateral view is taken with the elbow adducted to the side. Shoulder, elbow and wrist are again in one plane, i.e. the sagittal plane. This positioning will make the lateral view exactly perpendicular to the PA view. On a correctly positioned PA view the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon groove (arrow) can be seen. The extensor carpi ulnaris tendon groove should be at the level of or radial to the base of the ulnar styloid. True lateral: The palmar cortex of pisiform (red arrow) lies between the palmar cortex of scaphoid and capitate. A true lateral view is defined by the relationship between the pisiforme, capitate and scaphoid bones. On a standard lateral view, the palmar cortex of the pisiform bone should overlie the central third of the interval between the palmar cortices of the distal scaphoid pole and the capitate head. Apparent volar tilt of the surface of the distal radius, as measured on the lateral view, increases with supination and decreases with pronation of the wrist (5). A change of 10 degrees rotation between two consecutive control lateral radiographs is not uncommon during clinical follow-up and results in 5 degrees change in apparent tilt. CT should be performed if conventional radiographs provide insufficient detail about radiocarpal articular step-off and gap displacement. On the left a patient with a communitive intraarticular fracture of the distal radius with displacement of the volar rim of the radius together with the carpus (i.e. a volar Barton's). There is an axial CT image with 3D-, coronal and sagittal reconstructiosn. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll On the left sagittal reconstructions of 1mm axial CT slices. Scroll through the images and notice how well CT demonstrates the fracture components and the displacement. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is of benefit when concomitant injuries of ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are suspected or if a fracture is suspected but not demonstrated on routine radiographs. On the left a fracture of the ulnar styloid process not visible on standard radiography, but clearly demonstrated with MR.
Measurements:
Radial length or height Radial length is measured on the PA radiograph as the distance between one line perpendicular to the long axis of the radius passing through the distal tip of the radial styloid. A second line intersects distal articular surface of ulnar head. This measurement averages 10-13 mm. Radial inclination or angle Radial inclination represents the angle between one line connecting the radial styloid tip and the ulnar aspect of the distal radius and a second line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius. The radial inclination ranges between 21 and 25 degrees . Loss of radial inclination will increase the load across the lunate. Radial tilt Radial tilt is measured on a lateral radiograph. The radial tilt represents the angle between a line along the distal radial articular surface and the line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius at the joint margin. The normal volar tilt averages 11 degrees and has a range of 2-20 degrees .
Radiological Interpretation:
Table 1: Description of fracture characteristics There are many ways to describe distal radial fractures and there are several classification systems. In clinical practice however frequently eponyms like Colles' and Barton's are used. When these epomyms are used, an accurate description of the fracture characteristics should always be included in the report(5). In addition it should also be noted if there is osteoporosis or additional findings such as ligamentous injuries. We will discuss the following:
Location:
One of the most important characteristics is whether a fracture is extraarticular or intraarticular. Extraarticular fractures are usually less complicated, unless they are comminutive. Intraarticular fractures either involve the radiocarpal joint, distal radioulnar joint, or both. Extraarticular fracture with volar bending (Smith' farcture)
Configuration:
Always mention whether the fracture is transverse (good prognosis), oblique or comminuted (multifragmented). When a fracture is oblique or when it is comminuted with crossing of the mid axial line, it can be unstable. On the left a patient with an extraarticular distal radius fracture. Notice the oblique course on the lateral view. Fractures with this configuration frequently show loss of reduction at follow up and need surgical treatment. On the left a sagittal reconstruction of an oblique intraarticular fracture of the distal radius. This is a volar Barton's type fracture. Even in a cast the volar fragment will show progressive displacement at follow-up and a volar buttress plate is needed to hold the volar rim in place.
Displacement:
Fractures are either displaced or nondisplaced. A fracture with an offset of 2 mm or more in any plane or 2 mm offset involving the articular surface is considered displaced. Displacement can be dorsal, volar, radial or proximal. Axial shortening, radial inclination and radio-ulnar displacement can be measured on the routine posterior/anterior film. Dorsal tilt and dorsal or palmar displacement can be measured on the routine lateral X-ray. Fragment displacement and rotation may be further determined using CT.
Instability:
Instability is defined as a high risk of secondary displacement after initial adequate reduction. Radiographic signs that favor instability are displacement and an oblique or comminuted configuration (as mentioned above). These signs are listed in the table on the left. Although the initial x-ray after reduction may look good, always look for loss of reduction at follow up. Articular incongruity is the most important factor in the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis of the wrist. Avulsion of the tip or stable fractures of the ulnar neck
Ulna and Distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ):
Assessment of a wrist fracture must also include a description of the distal ulna and distal radioulnar joint (9). The distal ulna articulates with the sigmoid notch of the radius. Type I: stable Avulsion fractures of the tip of the ulnar styloid and stable fractures of the ulnar neck have a good prognosis. Following reduction of the radius the DRUJ is congruent and stable. Extraarticular unstable fractures however, require plate fixation. Tear of the TFCC or avulsion of the base of the ulnar styloid Type II: unstable There is subluxation or dislocation of the ulnar head as a result of avulsion of the base of the ulnar styloid or tear of the TFCC and/or capsular ligaments. The subluxation has to be reduced with closed or operative treatment to avoid chronic instability and arthosis. Intraarticular fracture of sigmoid notch or ulnar headModified and reprinted with permission from reference (9) Type III: potentially unstable Intraarticular fractures of the sigmoid notch and intraarticular fractures of the ulnar head are potentially unstable because the incongruity of the DRUJ. Subluxation is possible.
Common Fracture Eponyms:

Colles' fracture:
A Colles' fracture is a fracture of the distal metaphysis of the radius with dorsal angulation and displacement leading to a 'silver fork deformity'. Colles fractures are seen more frequently with advancing age and in women with osteoporosis. In many cases a Colles' fracture is an extraarticular, uncomplicated and stable fracture, but it can be intraarticular. So look for signs of instability in all Colles' fractures, especially: On the left a detailed AP view of the same patient as above. In addition to the dorsal angulation seen on the lateral view, notice the following: Just calling this fracture a Colles' fracture would be insufficient. All the characteristics have to be mentioned in the radiology report to convey the full extent of the injury, possible complications and treatment.
Smith's fracture:
Smith's fractures occur in younger patients and are the result of high energy trauma on the volar flexed wrist. Volar comminution and intraarticular extension are more common. On the left an extraarticular Smith's fracture with palmar and radial angulation and displacement. There is also an avulsion of the ulnar styloid process.
Barton's fracture:
Volar-type Barton's is a fracture-dislocation of the volar rim of the radius. This type is the most common. Dorsal-type Barton's is a fracture-dislocation of the dorsal rim of the radius. Dislocation of the radiocarpal joint is the hallmark of Barton's fractures. These are shear type fractures of the distal articular surface of the radius with translation of the distal radial fragment and the carpus. These fractures have a great tendency for redislocation and malunion. They usually require operative treatment. On the left a volar-type Barton's fracture. The radiographic findings are the following: On the left a dorsal-type Barton's fracture. The radiographic findings are the following:
Die-punch fracture:
A die-punch fracture is a depression fracture of the lunate fossa of the distal radius. It is the result of a transverse load through the lunate. The radiographic findings can be very subtle. In many cases there is also a subtle proximal displacement of lunate, seen as a break in carpal arc I. (see the article Wrist - Carpal instability). Die punch fracture On the left a typical die-punch fracture. The blue arrow indicates the depressed fragment of the lunate fossa. Notice the articular step-off. The yellow arrow indicates a subtle fracture of the radial styloid process. There is no disruption of carpal arc I. Notice that you can easily overlook such a fracture. On the left two 3D-reconstructions of the same fracture as above.
Chauffeur's fracture:
An isolated fracture of the radial styloid process is also called a Hutchinson's or chauffeur's fracture. Displacement of the fragment is uncommon. There can be associated injury to the scapholunate ligament. In most cases a fracture of the radial styloid process is part of a comminutive intraarticular fracture. Ulnar styloid process fracture An ulnar styloid process fracture is usually associated with radial fractures and rarely isolated. An isolated fracture of the tip is clinically insignificant. Displaced fractures of the base are usually associated with TFC tears and can be associated with instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). On the left a subtle fracture of the tip of the ulnar styloid process (blue arrow) in a patient with a volar Barton's fracture. Notice the depression of the volar rim.
Fractures in Children:

Torus fracture:
Torus fractures, or buckle fractures, are extremely common injuries in children. Because children have softer bones, one side of the bone may buckle. The word torus is derived from the Latin word 'Tori' meaning swelling or protuberance. These injuries tend to heal much more quickly than the similar greenstick fractures.
Green stick fracture:
These are partial fractures, since only one part of the bone is broken and the other side is bent. The name is derived from an analogy of breaking a young, fresh tree branch. Most often the greenstick fracture must be bent back into the proper position. Greenstick fractures can take a long time to heal because they tend to occur in the middle, more slowly growing parts of bone.
Epiphysiolysis fracture:
These are usually Salter Harris type II epiphysiolysis fractures. Restorage of the anatomical situation is necessary to prevent growth disturbances. Redislocation is common after closed reduction. In many cases they need percutaneous pinning.
Classification systems:

Muller AO-classification:
The Muller AO-classification is adapted by the Orthopaedic Trauma Association. In reference (6) a link is provided to download the illustrations of the Muller AO Classification of Fractures. A = extra-articular fracture B = partial articular fracture C = complete articular fracture of radius
Fernandez Classification:
This classification is popular, since it addresses the mechanism of injury and the consequent treatment options. Instability is defined as a high risk of secondary displacement after initial adequate reduction. Associated traumatic lesions are ligamentous rupture, nerve compression and compartment syndrome. Type 1 : Bending fracture Type 2 : Shearing fracture Type 3 : Compression fracture Type 4 : Avulsion fracture Fernandez classification. Modified and reprinted with permission from reference (9) Type 5 : Combined fractures
Treatment:
The treatment decision of a distal radius fracture is complex and depends on the type of the fracture, the age and activeness of the patient and the quality of the bone. At one extreme a stable, undisplaced extra-articular fracture has an excellent prognosis. At the other an unstable, displaced intra-articular fracture is difficult to treat and has a poor prognosis. If the alignment of the bones is not acceptable, they need to be reduced by closed or open reduction.
Indications for Reduction in Distal Radius Fractures:
Many authors suggest that distal radial fractures be reduced anatomically, but the real question is 'what is acceptable and what is not?'. Based on basic science and clincal studies some of the recommendations of the International Distal Radius Fracture Study Group are presented in the table on the left, although these recommendations are still the subject of ongoing debate (5). Good alignment after closed recuction for extraarticular Colles fracture
Closed Reduction:
The initial treatment for most radius fractures is closed reduction and plaster immobilization. A displaced fracture is reduced under regional or general anaesthetic. First the arm is placed under traction to unlock the fragments. The deformity is then reduced with appropriate closed reduction, depending on the type of deformity. A splint or cast is placed in such a way that the risk of re-displacement is minimized. X-rays are taken to ensure that the reduction was successful. The cast is usually maintained for about 6 weeks. X-ray in cast. Unsuccesful reduction. Guidelines for non-acceptable reduction are (8): On the left a control radiograph made after reduction. The reduction was unsuccessful, because there is a dorsal tilt > 10 degrees , loss of inclination and radial shortening.
Surgical treatment:
Although in most cases closed reduction is attempted, surgical intervention is required when there is failure to obtain or maintain closed reduction. 40% of distal radial fractures are considered to be unstable and require surgical fixation. Many techniques of fixation are now available, including percutaneous pinning, intramedullary pinning, external fixation, and internal fixation with customized implants, including the Distal Volar Radius (DVR) system. Surgical fixation allows almost immediate mobility. Ultimately less stiffness and greater function is possible. On the left a post-operative image of a Salter-Harris II fracture, which is held in place with two pins after closed reduction. On the left a patient with a die-punch fracture, nicely shown on an oblique radiograph. The fracture fragment of the lunate fossa was replaced and fixated with a screw. Volar buttress plate Barton's fractures are rarely successfully treated with closed reduction due to the shearing nature of the injury. A volar buttress plate is the treatment of choice. Comminution or osteoporotic bone make external fixation the preferred surgical treatment option. On the left an intraarticular fracture of the distal radius with shortening of the radius. The ulna abutts the lunate. External fixation was used to lengthen the radius. On the left a patient with a dorsal Barton's fracture (shown before). After closed reduction the position of the dorsal rim is better, but this still is an unstable situation. Volar plates were used with screws to lock the dorsal rim. The volar approach was chosen, because this is an easier approach. Final result after one of the plates has been removed.
Complications:

Malunion:
Non-union is uncommon in distal radial fractures, since there is excellent vascularisation of this region. Malunion however is a common complication and is related to radial shortening, angulation and incongruity of the articular surface. This results in malfunction and early osteoarthritis. More than 2 mm incongruity of articular surface is the most important factor in the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis of the wrist. On the left a patient with malunion. The radial shortening results in the ulna abutting the lunate. Notice the loss of radiocarpal joint space indicating osteoarthritis. Malunion Closed reduction is frequently unsuccessful when the fracture has an oblique course or when the fracture is comminutive. On the left a patient with an intraarticular fracture with dorsal tilt (i.e. intraarticular Colles' fracture). On the lateral radiograph at presentation there is an extreme dorsal tilt. After closed reduction and at follow up after one week, there is an acceptable tilt. Finally at 6 weeks follow-up, there is malunion with extreme dorsal tilt, radial shortening and loss of inclination. The ulna abutts the lunate. The final result will be malfunction, radiocarpal and distal radioulnar osteoarthritis. Risks specific to cast treatment relate to the potential for compression of the swollen arm causing compartment syndrome or carpal tunnel syndrome. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy and median nerve injury are uncommon complications. Complications associated with plating include tendon irritation or rupture and the need for plate removal. On the left another patient with malunion and osteoarthritis. There is also scapholunate dissociation as a result of associated ligamentous rupture with volar tilt of lunate indicating volar flexion instability (VISI). On the left another patient after unsuccessful treatment. There is loss of radial inclination and radial shortening, dorsal tilt and an articular step-off. by Charles A.

Fleischner 2017 guideline:
by Onno Mets and Robin Smithuis
the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam and the Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2017-07-01 Pulmonary nodules are frequently encountered incidentally on chest CT. The role of the radiologist is to separate between benign and possibly malignant lesions, and advise on follow-up imaging or additional invasive imaging techniques. This article summarizes the basics of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, and presents the newest management recommendations of the Fleischner Society.
Introduction:
In 2017 the updated Fleischner Society guideline was published[1]. These replace the recommendations for solid (2005) [2] and subsolid pulmonary nodules (2013) [3]. These new guidelines should reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up examinations and provide clear management decisions. Nodule characterization should be performed on thin-slice CT images ≤1.5 mm, since a small solid nodule may appear to have groundglass density on a thick slice due to partial-volume effect.
Fleischner Guideline 2017:

Solid nodules:
Solid pulmonary nodules can represent various etiologies: Perifissural nodules are a separate entity, since they usually represent intrapulmonary lymph nodes, which are benign and need no follow up. They are discussed in the last chapter. In another article we presented some features that can help to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions (click here) Unfortunately, there is considerable overlap and often no definitive answer can be given based on imaging morphology. Follow-up is therefore a commonly used strategy.
Subsolid nodules:
Most subsolid nodules are transient and the result of infection or hemorrhage. However, persistent subsolid nodules often represent pathology in the adenocarcinomatous spectrum. No reliable distinction can be made radiologically, although studies suggest that larger size and a solid component are associated with more invasive behaviour. Compared to solid lesions, persistent subsolid nodules have a much slower growth rate, but carry a much higher risk of malignancy. In a study by Henschke et al., part-solid nodules were malignant in 63%, pure groundglass SSNs in 18% and solid nodules only in 7% [4]. Subsolid nodules in the adenocarcinomatous spectrum were formerly known as bronchoalveolar carcinoma or BAC. This terminology should no longer be used. A new pathology-based classification for adenocarcinoma was introduced in 2011 and this current classification makes distinction between: Transient subsolid nodule Transient subsolid nodules usually represent infection or alveolar hemorrhage. To differentiate between transient or persistent subsolid nodules a follow-up CT should be obtained. Previously, it was recommended to repeat imaging after 3 months, however, this interval has been increased to 12 months. Because of the slower growth rate, the total follow-up period for persistent subsolid nodules has been increased to 5 years. The images show a 7 mm pure groundglass subsolid nodule in the right upper lobe. On follow-up CT this proved to be a transient subsolid nodule. Persistent malignant subsolid nodule These images show a pure groundglass subsolid nodule in the right lower lobe. This lesion demonstrated growth in a two year interval and proved to be malignant after resection.
Risk factors:
Defining high- or low-risk is currently more difficult than it was in the old guideline. Previously a high-risk subject was identified based on a history of heavy smoking, history of lung cancer in a first-degree relative or exposure to asbestos, radon or uranium. Now, it is aimed for to separate high-risk lesions from low-risk ones by considering more parameters than subject characteristics alone (See Table). Since these risk factors are numerous and have different effects on the malignancy risk, it is proposed to assess final risk categories concerning the probability of malignancy 8.
Notes:
The guideline recommends follow-up for nodules with an estimated lung cancer risk of around 1% or greater, which is an arbitrary cut-off. The likelihood of malignancy is different for an incidentally found pulmonary nodule in the lower lobe of a relatively young patient compared to a nodule in the upper lobe of a high-risk heavy smoker, or in a patient with a known or suspected malignancy. For this reason the Fleischner guideline for the management of pulmonary nodules separates high- and low-risk, and does not apply to subjects younger than 35 years, immunocompromised patients or patients with cancer [1].
Pulmonary Nodule Measurements:
A lesion which measures 8 x 5 mm has an average of (8 + 5) : 2 = 6.5 mm - rounded up to 7 mm In the Fleischner guidelines nodule dimensions can be obtained using either 2D caliper measurements or 3D nodule volumetry. Manual 2D caliper measurements should be based on the average of the long- and short-axis diameters of the nodule. These should be obtained on the same transverse, coronal or sagittal reconstructed image, whichever plane reveals the greatest dimensions [1]. This is new compared to the prior guideline, in which dimensions were averaged diameters in the axial plane only [2]. Manual 2D caliper measurements should be rounded to the nearest whole millimeter. In part-solid subsolid nodules both the total nodule as well as the solid component dimensions should be measured separately, both using the abovementioned averaging technique.
Perifissural nodules:
Perifissural nodules are a separate entity, and likely represent intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Morphologically these are solid, homogeneous nodules with a smooth margin, and are oval or rounded, lentiform or triangular in shape. Their location is within 15 mm of the fissure or the pleura. They may or may not have contact with an interlobar septum. The latter differentiates between a typical and atypical PFN (see Figure). PFNs can show significant growth rates on serial imaging, sometimes comparable to malignant nodules. This is not a typical sign of malignancy, but merely a result of their presumed lymphatic origin. Typical PFNs. Images from Ref [Hoop]. In screening setting it has been shown that none of the 919 typical and atypical PFNs were found to be malignant in a 5.5 year follow-up [5]. This confirmed prior results of Ahn et al. [6]. It is assumed that this benign etiology can be extrapolated to clinical subjects, which has recently been supported by a study using routine-care clinical CT imaging [7]. The currently available guidelines recommend that when small nodules have a perifissural or other juxtapleural location and a morphology consistent with an intrapulmonary lymph node, follow-up CT is not recommended, even if the average dimension exceeds 6 mm.

Prokop Perifissurally located nodules that do not conform to the morphologic characteristics should be regarded as non-PFN nodules (Figure) and does require follow-up. by MacMahon et al.

Vascular territories of the Brain:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Alrijne Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2008-11-24 Knowledge of the vascular territories is important, because it enables you to recognize infarctions in arterial territories, in watershed regions and also venous infarctions. It also helps you to differentiate infarction from other pathology.
Cerebral Arterial Territory:
Vascular territories of the cerebral arteries (adapted and modified with permission from M. Savoiardo (1) The PICA territory is on the inferior occipital surface of the cerebellum and is in equilibrium with the territory of the AICA in purple, which is on the lateral side (1). The larger the PICA territory, the smaller the AICA and viceversa.
* Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA in grey) The SCA territory is in the superior and tentorial surface of the cerebellum.
* Branches from vertebral and basilar artery These branches supply the medulla oblongata (in blue) and the pons (in green).
* Anterior Choroideal artery (AchA in blue)) The territory of the AChA is part of the hippocampus, the posterior limb of the internal capsule and extends upwards to an area lateral to the posterior part of the cella media.
* Lenticulo-striate arteries The lateral LSA' s (in orange) are deep penetrating arteries of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Their territory includes most of the basal ganglia. The medial LSA' s (indicated in dark red) arise from the anterior cerebral artery (usually the A1-segment). Heubner's artery is the largest of the medial lenticulostriate arteries and supplies the anteromedial part of the head of the caudate and anteroinferior internal capsule.
* Anterior cerebral artery (ACA in red) The ACA supplies the medial part of the frontal and the parietal lobe and the anterior portion of the corpus callosum, basal ganglia and internal capsule.
* Middle cerebral artery (MCA in yellow) The cortical branches of the MCA supply the lateral surface of the hemisphere, except for the medial part of the frontal and the parietal lobe (anterior cerebral artery), and the inferior part of the temporal lobe (posterior cerebral artery).
 The deep penetrating LSA-branches are discussed above.
* Posterior cerebral artery (PCA in green) P1 extends from origin of the PCA to the posterior communicating artery, contributing to the circle of Willis. Posterior thalamoperforating arteries branch off the P1 segment and supply blood to the midbrain and thalamus. Cortical branches of the PCA supply the inferomedial part of the temporal lobe, occipital pole, visual cortex, and splenium of the corpus callosum. On the left a detail to illustrate the vascular supply to the basal ganglia.
PICA:
On the left CT-images of a left-sided PICA-infarction. Notice the posterior extention. The infarction was the result of a dissection (blue arrow). On the left MR-images of a left-sided PICA-infarction. In unilateral infarcts there is always a sharp delineation in the midline because the superior vermian branches do not cross the midline, but have a sagittal course. This sharp delineation may not be evident until the late phase of infarction. In the early phase, edema may cross the midline and create diagnostic difficulties. Infarctions at pontine level are usually paramedian and sharply defined because the branches of the basilar arery have a sagittal course and do not cross the midline. Bilateral infarcts are rarely observed because these patients do not survive long enough to be studied, but sometimes small bilateral infarcts can be seen.
SCA:
On the left MR-image of a cerebellar infarction in the region of the superior cerebellar artery and also in the brainstem in the territory of the PCA. Notice the limitation to the midline. ACA infarction
ACA:
Anterior cerebral artery: Infarction of right hippocampal region (courtesy Frederik Barkhof)
Anterior choroidal artery:
The anterior choroidal artery originates from the internal carotid artery. Rarely it arises from the middle cerebral artery. The territory of the anterior choroidal artery encompasses part of the hippocampus, the posterior limb of the internal capsule and extends upwards to an area lateral to the posterior part of the cella media. The whole area is rarely involved in AChA infarcts. The posterior limb of the internal capsule also receives blood from the lateral lenticulostriate arteries. On the left an uncommon infarction in the hippocampal region. Part of the territory of the anterior choroidal artery and the PCA are involved. MCA infarction. Involvement of cortical branches and deep perforating lenticulo-striate arteries
Middle cerebral artery:
The MCA has cortical branches and deep penetrating branches, which are called the lateral lenticulo-striate arteries. The territory of the lateral lenticulo-striate perforating arteries of the MCA is indicated with a different color from the rest of the territory of the MCA because it is a well-defined area supplied by penetrating branches, which may be involved or spared in infarcts separately from the main cortical territory of the MCA. On the left a T2W-image of a patient with an infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Notice that the lateral lenticulo-striate perforating arteries of the MCA are also involved (orange arrow).
Lenticulostriate arteries:
Medial lenticulostriate arteries They are branches of the A1-segment of the anterior cerebral artery. They supply the anterior inferior parts of the basal nuclei. They also supply the anterior limb of the internal capsule together with the recurrent artery of Huebner, which also is a branch of the anterior cerebral artery. Lateral lenticulostriate arteries They are branches of the horizontal M1-segment of the middle cerebral artery. They supply the superior part of the head and the body of the caudate nucleus, most of the globus pallidus and putamen. They also supply the anterior limb of the internal capsule and parts of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, which is largely supplied by the anterior choroidal artery. CT and T2W-gradient echo image of a hemorrhagic infarction limited to the territory of the lateral lenticulo-striate arteries On the left images of a hemorrhagic infarction in the area of the deep perforating lenticulostriate branches of the MCA. MCA infarction with luxury perfusion On the left enhanced CT-images of a patient with an infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). There is extensive gyral enhancement (luxury perfusion). Sometimes this luxury perfusion may lead to confusion with tumoral enhancement. PCA infarction
Posterior cerebral artery (PCA):
Deep or proximal PCA strokes cause ischemia in the thalamus and/or midbrain, as well as in the cortex. Superficial or distal PCA infarctions involve only cortical structures (4). On the left a patient with acute vision loss in the right half of the visual field. The CT demonstrates an infarction in the contralateral visual cortex, i.e left occipital lobe. PCA infarction Only about 5% of ischemic strokes involve the PCA or its branches (3). On the left CT-images of a patient with a PCA-infarction.
Notice the loss of gray/white matter differentiation in the regio of the left occipital lobe.
Variations in Arterial Territories:
Images courtesy Jeroen Hendrikse (9) Variations in perfusion territories in the brain can be visualized with selective arterial spin-labeling (9). The ability to visualize these perfusion territories is important in specific patient groups with cerebrovascular disease, such as acute stroke, large artery steno-occlusive disease, and arteriovenous malformation, as it provides valuable hemodynamic information. On the left the time-of-flight MR angiography-images of brain-feeding arteries showing the planning of the selective slabs for perfusion territory imaging of the left and right internal carotid artery and the vertebrobasilar artery. Normal perfusion territories in a patient with a lacunar infarction Images courtesy Jeroen Hendrikse (9) On the left a patient with a lacunar infarction on the left with normal perfusion territories. Cortical infarction in the left frontal lobe which is supplied by the right ICA Images courtesy Jeroen Hendrikse (9) On the left a patient with a watershed infarct in the left hemisphere and also a cortical infarction in the left frontal lobe (arrow). Notice that there is a variation in the brain perfusion since the left frontal lobe is supplied by the right internal carotid artery. Images courtesy Jeroen Hendrikse (9) On the left another variation in the brain perfusion in a patient with multiple infarctions as demonstrated on the diffusion images. There is a small cortical infarction in the left occipital lobe which happens to be perfused by the left internal carotid artery (arrow). Notice that there is no contribution by the vertebrobasilar arteries.
Watershed Infarcts:
Watershed infarcts occur at the border zones between major cerebral arterial territories as a result of hypoperfusion. There are two patterns of border zone infarcts: Infarctions of the deep white matter of the centrum semiovale and corona radiata at the border zone between lenticulostriate perforators and the deep penetrating cortical branches of the MCA or at the border zone of deep white matter branches of the MCA and the ACA. Deep watershed infarction in a patient with an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery On the left three consecutive CT-images of a patient with an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. The hypoperfusion in the right hemisphere resulted in multiple internal border zone infarctions. This pattern of deep watershed infarction is quite common and should urge you to examine the carotids. See the article on Multiple Sclerosis for the differentiation between internal border zone infarctions, lacunar infarctions and MS. Borderzone infarcts due to occlusion of the internal carotid On the left images of a patient who has small infarctions in the right hemisphere in the deep borderzone (blue arrowheads) and also in the cortical borderzone between the MCA- and PCA-territory (yellow arrows). There is abnormal signal in the right carotid (red arrow) as a result of occlusion. In patients with abnormalities that may indicate borderzone infarcts, always study the images of the carotid artery to look for abnormal signal. On the left another example of small infarctions in the deep borderzone and in the cortical borderzone between the MCA- and PCA-territory in the left hemisphere. On the left an example of infarctions in the deep borderzone and in the cortical borderzone between the ACA- and MCA-territory. The abnormal signal intensity in the right carotid is the result of an occlusion. This combination of findings is so common, that once you know the pattern, you will see it many times.
Lacunar Infarcts:
Lacunar infarcts are small infarcts in the deeper parts of the brain (basal ganglia, thalamus, white matter) and in the brain stem. Lacunar infarcts are caused by occlusion of a single deep penetrating artery. Lacunar infarcts account for 25% of all ischemic strokes. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of lacunar infarcts followed by emboli. 25% of patients with clinical and radiologically defined lacunes had a potential cardiac cause for their strokes. On the left a T2W- and FLAIR image of a lacunar infarct in the left thalamus. On the FLAIR image the infarct is hardly seen. There is only a small area of subtle hyperintensity. Lacunes may be confused with other empty spaces, such as enlarged perivascular Virchow-Robin spaces (VRS). The VRS are extensions of the subarachnoid space that accompany vessels entering the brain parenchyma. Widening of VRS often first occurs around penetrating arteries in the substantia perforata and can be seen on transverse MRI slices around the anterior commisure, even in young subjects (5). On the left CT- and MR-images at the level of the anterior commisure (blue arrows). On the CT there is a hypodense area in the right hemisphere, which follows the signal intensity of CSF on T2W- and FLAIR-images, which is typical for widened VRS.
PRES:
PRES (courtesy Madja Turnher) PRES is short for Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome. It is also known as reversible posterior Leukoencephalopathy syndrome [RPLS]. It classically consists of potentially reversible vasogenic edema in the posterior circulation territories, but anterior circulation structures can also be involved (6). Many causes have been described including hypertension, eclampsia and preeclampsia, immunosuppressive medications such as cyclosporine. The mechanism is not entirely understood but is thought to be related to a hyperperfusion state, with blood-brain-barrier breakthrough, extravasation of fluid potentially containing blood or macromolecules, and resulting cortical or subcortical edema. The typical imaging findings of PRES are most apparent as hyperintensity on FLAIR images in the parietooccipital and posterior frontal cortical and subcortical white matter; less commonly, the brainstem, basal ganglia, and cerebellum are involved. On the left images of a patient with reversible neurological symptoms. The abnormalities are seen both in the posterior circulation as well as in the basal ganglia. Continue. Four days later most of the abnormalities have disappeared.
Cerebral Venous territory:
There is great variation in the territories of venous drainage. The illustrations on the left should be regarded as a rough guide.

Abdominal wall hernias:
Marc Engelbrecht, Simba Timmer, Erwin van Geffen and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Amsterdam Medical Center, Department of Surgery Jeroen Bosch hospital and the Alrijne hospital in Leiden:
Abdominal hernias are usually a clinical diagnosis and have been considered a simple
problem to be repaired. 
However, long-term follow-up of patients has shown
disappointing results, both in terms of complications and recurrence (1). 
Due
to increased complex abdominal wall surgery, pre-operative CT planning with
abdominal wall mapping has gained increasing attention.
In this article we will
adress the key imaging features of complex abdominal wall hernias.
Introduction:

Structured Radiology Report:
What the surgeon needs to know is: In the table you will find the most important items, that need to be addressed in the radiology report.
All these subjects will be discussed in this order in the next chapters.
Abdominal wall musculature:
Important muscular structures that surround the abdominal
organs are shown in this figure. The linea alba is a line
formed by the aponeuroses of the right and left rectus muscle and connects both
muscles in the midline. 
As the linea alba is an avascular area, it is
frequently used as point of entrance for open abdominal surgery. The linea semilunaris is a curved tendinous line that is located lateral to the rectus
abdominis muscle on both sides. 
Here, the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths
connect with the three lateral abdominal wall muscles: the external oblique,
the internal oblique and the transverse abdominal. This illustration demonstrates how the anterior and posterior rectus
sheath are formed by the aponeuroses of the external oblique, internal
oblique and transverse abdominal muscles.
Because abdominal
wall hernias are defects of the fascia of the abdominal wall, these fascia layers need to be brought
together during surgery. 
Therefore, the rectus sheaths play an important role
in surgical hernia repair.
Type of abdominal wall defect:

Primary hernia:
Abdominal wall hernias can be divided into primary hernias, that are not related to incisions and incisional hernias. Primary abdominal hernias are hernias, that are located at certain weak spots in the abdominal wall.
In the midline are the umbilical and epigastric hernia and lateral are the Spigelian and lumbar hernia.
The Spigelian hernia is an uncommon hernia at a weak spot between the oblique abdominal muscles and the rectus abdominis.
Primary lumbar hernias are uncommon and are also located lateral but more posteriorly, where there is a weak spot between the oblique abdominal muscles and the quadratus lumborum. They can be divided into
superior and inferior lumbar hernias (Greenfellt-Lesshaft and Petit).
Incisional hernia:
Incisional hernias are the most common and can be located anywhere, where there has been an incision, drain opening, trauma or prior repair of a primary hernia.
Most incision hernias are located in the midline.
Incisional hernias in the lumbar region can be seen after nephrectomy, hepatopancreatobiliary, or aortic-surgery. Examples of abdominal wall hernias:
Rectus diastasis:
Rectus diastasis is a widening between the left and
right rectus muscle with protrusion of visceral fat or bowel (figure).
The difference with a hernia is that in diastasis there is no fascia defect.
A gap of 2,0 cm between left and right rectus muscle is considered diastasis.
Besides transverse width, craniocaudal length of the diastasis should be measured as well. Rectus
diastasis in men is often caused by increased visceral fat and in women due to
pregnancy.
Abdominal wall hernias may coexist with diastasis.
Diastasis is important to mention as hernia recurrence is more likely in the presence of rectus diastasis.
Location and size of the defect:
The number of defects and the location of the defect should
be reported.
As mentioned before, hernias are classified as midline as long as they are located
within the lateral borders of the rectus sheath (e.g. the linea semilunaris). Lateral
hernias are located lateral to the linea semilunaris. A description of the size of the abdominal wall
defect is needed for pre-operative planning. 
The size consists of width and
height. Here a schematic illustration of the measurements
of the defect in two axes: longitudinal and transverse (see Figure).
For
midline hernias cranio-caudal location can be described by the distance to the
xiphoid or symphysis pubis. 
For lateral hernias, cranio-caudal location
can be described by distance to the costal margin or iliac crest. When multiple defects are present, the combined length and width of all the
defects should be reported because multiple defects are normally treated as one
functional defect (like Swiss Cheese). 
However if hernias are located
relatively far away, they can be described as separate hernias. Here an example of the measurement of the defect
size. 
The hernia width is the maximum distance in between the rectus muscles,
measured on the axial view at which this distance is largest. 
The defect height
is the maximum cranio-caudal distance, measured in the sagittal plane. Measurement of multiple hernias This patient has two hernias.
There is a midline hernia (yellow arrowheads) and a lateral hernia (white arrowheads).
in this case the total combined length and total width are measured.
Rectus to Defect Ratio:
The Rectus to Defect Ratio (RDR) is the ratio of
the sum of the width of the left and right rectus compared to the hernia width. Another name for this equation, often used by surgeons, is the Carbonell-index named after Prof Alfredo Carbonell who first published this. The RDR is a practical and reliable tool to predict
the ability to close the abdominal wall defect during routine hernia repair
without the need to perform an additional component separation technique (CST). Component separation technique is a surgical techniques in which one of the three lateral muscles is transsected from the others.
These techniques ‘loosen’ the remaining abdominal wall, but are associated with a higher risks of postoperative complications (see treatment). If the RDR is > 2, routine surgical repair will be able to close the abdominal wall defect in 90% of cases.
If the RDR is < 1.5, in more than 52% of the repairs, additional component separation technique is required. Image
In this
patient the Rectus to Defect Ratio: (49 mm + 43 mm) / 157 mm = 0.58. This ratio predicts
that hernia closure will probably not be possible without performing a component separation technique. Image
In a different patient, the Rectus to Defect Ratio
is: (73 mm + 81 mm) / 51 mm = 3. Contrary to the previous case, hernia closure will be possible without performing a component separation technique.
Loss of Domain:
Loss of domain is a ratio that describes the amount
of peritoneal content that is located in the hernia sac. 
This ratio is used to
predict the risk of peri-operative complications as well as the need for preoperative
botulinum injections and/or component separation technique. This ratio is calculated by dividing
the hernia sac volume (HSV) by the total peritoneal volume (TPV). 
The total
peritoneal volume consist of the hernia sac volume plus the
abdominal cavity volume (ACV). 
For more information on preoperative botox
injections: see treatment. The specific volumes can be obtained through volume
rendering or with a simplified method to
estimate the volumes, i.e. the height, width and depth of the hernia and abdomen
are multiplied by 0.52 (the formula of an ellipse). The height of the abdomen is measured from the
upper edge of the liver to the symphysis, the width is measured in between the
transversus abdominal muscles on both sides. 
The depth is measured from the
anterior side of the vertebral column to the anterior abdominal wall.
If the anterior abdominal wall is no longer present, due to a large ventral hernia, extrapolation of the remnant anterior abdominal wall may be done, so abdominal depth may be measured.
The
height, width, and depth of the hernia are measured within the hernia sac.
For
more information on Loss of Domain measurments see ref 6. If the loss of domain is larger than 20 %, there is a high risk of surgical complications and abdominal wall repair will result in increased
abdominal cavity pressure with complications such as respiratory failure and
hernia recurrence (ref 7 and ref 8). ImageIn this patient the loss of domain is > 20% and additional strategies will be necessary to increase the abdominal capacity and compliance. In this patient with a large hernia, the measurements are as follows: The loss of domain in this case is the volume of the hernia sac divided by the volume of the total peritoneal cavity: 
3.1: 8.9 = 35%. This is far
greater than 20% and means that there is a high risk of
complications during and after a simple abdominal wall repair. In this patient with a hernia, the measurements are as follows: Loss of Domain = 1,12 / 6,2 x 100% = 18 %
Complications:

Incarceration:
The most
serious and acute complication is an incarcerated hernia. 
An incarcerating
hernia can be diagnosed by looking at two separate features, namely small
bowel obstruction and signs of impending strangulation. Actually these are all signs of closed loop obstruction, which is the cause of the strangulation.
You will find more information about closed loop obstruction here. These images are of a 78 year old morbid obese female who has an incisional midline hernia. Study the images and then compare to the next images, who were taken one month later, when she presented with a painfully swolen hernia. Now there are signs of strangulation namely: As in any hernia that contains bowel, strangulation in abdominal wall hernias occurs as a result of closed loop obstruction with venous infarction. Image
This patient has a hernia that contains small bowel. 
The defect is rather small and there is a stenosis at the point where the bowel enters the hernia sac (yellow arrow) and where it exits the hernia (white arrow).
These two stenosis are proof of a closed loop obstruction.
There is dilatation of the bowel and fat infiltration as a result of ischemia resulting from venous obstruction. Continue with the video... Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. The video better demonstrates the two stenoses. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. This is another example of a closed loop obstruction within the hernia sac.
The white arrow indicates the first obstruction, where the bowel enters the closed loop.
The yellow arrow indicates the exit.
In this case the closed loop is caused by adhesions within the hernia sack. Notice the fat infiltration and the dilated loops with slightly hyperdense walls.
These are all signs of bowel ischemia. Immediate laparotomy was performed.
The bowel within the hernia sac was ischemic and had a purple color, but after cleavage of the adhesions, the color of the bowel returned to normal. Abdominal wall abscess
Mesh infection:
A common complication
of abdominal wall surgery is the development of a fluid collection. 
It is
important to differentiate sterile collections like hematoma and seroma from an abscess Image
This patient had abdominal wall hernia surgery with bilateral component separation surgery. 
There is a large fluid collection with air bubbles as a result of infection. Infected mesh ImageFluid collection with air configurations (black arrow) and associated fistula to the abdominal wall (blue arrow). This is an infected mesh.
Mesh ingrowth in bowel:
This is an uncommon complication. Image
A calcified mesh has migrated into
the bowel (black arrow).
Adhesions:
The presence of viscera inside the hernia sac is associated with greater difficulty in dissecting it and greater risk of an iatrogenic injury compared to hernias that only contain fat. Image
There is a midline hernia with bowel content.
There are adhesions between the bowel and the thickened skin (arrow). In this patient there are also adhesions connecting the skin to the bowel (black arrow), but also to the bladder (blue arrow) Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. In this patient the hernia sac contains small bowel, large bowel and parts of the liver, stomach and pancreas.
Entero-atmospheric fistula:
In this patient leakage of oral contrast is seen arrow heads
and white arrow.
Treatment:
Examples of the many positions of meshes The only treatment option for abdominal wall hernia is surgery.
The aim is to close the abdominal cavity by re-approximating the fascial edges of the rectus muscles.
Attention should be paid that this is done without too much tension on the midline repair. A mesh is almost always used to provide additional strenght and to minimize the risk of a recurrent hernia. A mesh can be placed in many positions, but preferably located posterior to the rectus muscle. 
This is called a retrorectus repair as originally described by Rives, Stoppa and Wantz.
An intra-peritoneal positioned mesh, which can be placed by open or laparoscopic repair, has a greater chance of bowel erosion and fistula formation on the long run. Retrorectus repair
Rives-Stoppa repair:
In the Rives-Stoppa repair the skin is
incised and the hernia sac is opened. The bowel is put to the side and
protected by gauze. On both sides the posterior rectus sheath is transsected
from the rectus muscle, creating the retromuscular space. This
space is dissected laterally, just up to the linea semilunaris. 
Then, the
posterior rectus sheaths from both sides are sutured together in the midline.
On this posterior layer, a mesh is positioned. 
Then, the rectus muscles are
brought together, and the anterior rectus sheaths from both sides are sutured
in the midline.
Component separation:
The above-described
surgical repair is quite straightforward and can be used for small and medium
sized hernias. 
For large hernias or hernias with large loss of domain,
it will not be possible to medialize the rectus muscles without too much tension. Component separation techniques (CST) are surgical strategies that facilitate
medialization of the rectus muscles, by transection one of the lateral
abdominal wall muscles from the other two. In the Ramirez technique
(also known as the open anterior CST), after mobilization of the skin and subcutaneous tissue up to the semilunar line, 
the external oblique is
dissected from the internal oblique.
It
provides about 10cm of medialization, but is associated with a high risk
of postoperative wound complications, because of the skin mobilization. Images
Transversus Abdominus Release (oTAR):
The open posterior Components Separation or Transversus Abdominus Release (oTAR) is now the preferred treatment for large abdominal hernias.
The first step in TAR is entry into the retrorectus space from the posterior side and dissection is proceeded laterally to the linea semilunaris, the most lateral aspect of the retrorectus space. 
Next the posterior rectus sheath is longitudinally divided as laterally as possible, taking care to avoid the subcostal nerves, and then the fibers of the muscular part of the Transversus Abdominus are divided with electrocautery.
By dividing the transversus abdominis muscle from the oblique internal muscles, it becomes possible to approximate both the posterior rectus sheaths. The retromuscular space is then developed to as far as the lateral border of the psoas muscle. 
The dissection is repeated on the opposite site and may be carried superiorly to the central tendon of the diaphragm, using a subxiphoid and retrosternal dissection. It may also be developed inferiorly to the retropubic space. 
Then the posterior rectus sheaths are approximated to one another and a sublay mesh is placed into the retromuscular space that has been developed. Robotic AssistedTransversus Abdominus Release(rTAR)Most TAR procedures are currently performed by a Robot Assisted procedure. This has the advantage of a minimal invasive procedure, with less blood loss, lower risk of wound related complications, less morbidity and decreased length of stay in the  hospital. By dividing the transversus abdominis muscle from the oblique internal muscles, it will become possible to approximate both the posterior rectus sheathsRecent systematic review in Hernia.
Botox injections:
Component separation technique can be very effective, but is invasive and permanent.
Botuline (Botox) injection in the muscles of the lateral abdominal wall is a
non-invasive pretreatment, and its use has become very popular in the
last couple of years. Injections 4 - 6 weeks before surgery results in thinning
and elongation of the muscles and can preclude the need to
perform CST in large hernias. Image
Thinning and elongation of the oblique muscles after Botox injection..
CT protocol:
For primary and small hernias ultrasound imaging can suffice. 
For all other type of hernias CT imaging is preferred. 
I.v. contrast is not always necessary, but can be helpful in complicated cases.

Acute Aortic Syndrome:

Aortic Dissection, Intramural Hematoma and Penetrating Ulcer:
Ferco Berger, Robin Smithuis, Otto van Delden
From the Radiology Department of the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam and the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2006-04-10 The term Acute Aortic Syndrome (AAS) is used to describe three closely related emergency entities of the thoracic aorta: classic Aortic Dissection (AD), Intramural Hematoma (IMH) and Penetrating Atherosclerotic Ulcer (PAU). Clinically these conditions are indistinguishable. CT is the most accurate imaging modality for the initial diagnosis, differentiation and staging. This review will discuss the imaging features and important pitfalls. *by Ferco Berger, Otto van Delden and Robin Smithuis Radiology department of the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam and the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands.*
Imaging Protocol:
Image protocol will be based on the type of scanner that is available. Our imaging protocol is based on a 4 slice helical CT-scanner. For the evaluation of patients with suspected AAS, we use 4x2,5 mm collimation technique
with 5 mm axial reconstructions and coronal, sagittal and oblique MPRs. A non-enhanced scan of the thoracic aorta is included for the detection of an intramural hematoma (IMH). This is followed by a contrast-enhanced scan of the aorta in the arterial phase with bolus triggering and in the venous phase (100 ml Visipaque, 3ml/sec). Contrast differences between arterial and venous phase can be helpful in differentiating true and false lumen. The iliac tract is included for evaluation of endovascular treatment possibilities. The branches of the arch are visualized to evaluate the extend of dissection and awareness of possible neurological complications. Type A dissection extending into the brachiocephalic arteries.LEFT: not visible on left arm injection.RIGHT: Same patient with right arm injection. Important reduction of artifacts and thus decreasing pitfalls, can be achieved by: Also keep in mind that placing ROIs can be difficult with dissected lumina (should be just distal to the aortic arch).) Have the technician be prepared to manually start upon visual feedback.
Classification of Acute Aortic Syndrome:
Typical Aortic Dissection, Intramural Hematoma and Penetrating Aortic Ulcer. Classic Aortic Dissection (AD), Intramural Hematoma (IMH) and Penetrating Atherosclerotic Ulcer (PAU) are distinct entities, but closely related. This is reflected upon in their identical therapeutical strategies. The main goal for the radiologist is not only to detect which entity is causing the clinical problem, but more importantly to differentiate between type A and B!
Stanford classification:
The Acute Aortic Syndrome (AAS) is classified according to Stanford.
Stanford Type A lesions involve the ascending aorta and aortic arch and may or may not involve the descending aorta. 
Stanford Type B lesions involve the thoracic aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. The Stanford classification has replaced the DeBakey classification (type I= ascending, arch and descending aorta: type II= only ascending aorta: type III= only descending aorta). Treatment options for the 2 subgroups of the acute aortic syndrome (AAS) are very different: Stanford type A will be treated with surgery or endovascular therapy. Stanford Type B will be treated medically.
Aortic Dissection (AD):
Classic Aortic Dissection Classic Aortic Dissection is the most common entity causing an acute aortic syndrome (70%). LEFT: Type A dissection with clear intimaflap seen within the aortic arch.RIGHT: Type B dissection. Entry point distal to left subclavian artery. Management decisions are based on the following information: Type B dissection. Green arrow indicates entry. False lumen is indicated by yellow arrows and is seen spiraling around the true lumen.
Imaging features:

Dissection into brachiocephalic arteries:
Carefully sort out which branches of the aortic arch are involved. Make sure from which lumina they arise. Left: Continued dissection into the celic trunk showing bigger false lumen, significantly contributing to organ perfusion.Right: : SMA and renal artery involvement, illustrating possible cause of organ malperfusion
Dissection into abdominal arteries:
The celiac trunc, SMA and right renal artery flow usually originates from the true lumen. Left renal artery flow mostly originates from the false lumen. Impaired perfusion of end-organs can be due to 2 mechanisms: 1) static = continuing dissection in the feeding artery (usually treated by stenting) 2) dynamic = dissection flap hanging in front of ostium like a curtain (usually treated with fenestration). This may be hard to discern, MPR's can be helpfull. Look for the re-entry point, usually to be found in the iliac tract. Provide information about tortuisity and calcifications of the iliac tract if endovascular procedures are being considered. LEFT: Dissected SMARIGHT: No change at 20 months follow up When no end-organs are compromised and there is sufficient perfusion, dissection can be left alone. This may persist for a long time without clinical consequence, as is seen in the patient on the left with follow-up of 2 years. Some dissections remained unchanged during a follow up of more than 5 years. Left: pericardial fluid / hematoma indicates rupture of the dissected aorta. Even small amounts are proving rupture, though hematoma can be extensive such as in this case.Right: Massive hematoma caused by rupture of the dissected aorta into the mediastinum and pleural cavity, no pericaldial hematoma.
Rupture into pericardium and thoracic cavity:
Even the slightest amount of fluid in pericardium, mediastinum or pleural cavity is suggestive of rupture of the dissection. The cases on the left show evident rupture, with presence of extensive hematoma in above mentioned locations. Note extreme hematothorax and hematomediastinum, causing shift of the mediastinum and compression on the pulmonary veins and even aorta. No pericardial effusion visible. Type B aortic dissection in a non-operable patient. At 5 days flow reappeared in false lumen. Finally at 9 months a saccular aneurysm has formed. The case on the left is a patient who presented with a fully thrombosed false lumen. 5 days after initial presentation this patient complained of acute chest pain mimicking the earlier episode. Re-examination showed recurrence of flow in the false lumen, locally contained, but with alarming adhering pleural effusion. The patient could not undergo surgical or endovascular repair for various reasons and was treated consevatively. LEFT: Dissection with a thrombosed false lumen. RIGHT: Aneurysm with thrombus on the inner side of the intimal calcifications.
Aneurysm with thrombus versus thrombosed dissection:
It can be difficult to differentiate an aneurysm with thrombus from a dissection with a thrombosed false lumen. If there are intima calcifications this will be very helpfull. A false lumen displaces the intimal calcifications.
Intramural Hematoma:
Intramural Hematoma is a result of ruptured vasa vasorum Brief facts: Classic example of IMH. Hyperdense hematoma on NECT. Intima calcifications surround the true lumen. What the clinician needs to know Predictors of mortality: Ascending Aorta > 5 cm ? IMH thickness > 2 cm Pericardial effusion (to less extend pleural effusion) On the left a Intramural hematoma, hyperdense on a NECT. Same case. CECT of Intramural hematoma type B. Same case contrast enhanced CT. Note that the IMH does not spiral around the true lumen, like in classic AD, helping to differentiate both. Essentially, this is not important, therapeutical decision will be made by whether this IMH is classified as Type A or Type B IMH! Note that there is no pericardial effusion. IMH thickness stays below 2 cm, making regression of this Type B IMH likely (up to 80%).
Penetrating Atherosclerotic Ulcer:
PAU is defined as an ulceration of an atheromatous plaque that has eroded the inner elastic layer of the aortic wall. It has reached the media and produced a hematoma within the media. Brief facts: Typical illustration of PAU, focal outpouchings of contrast, separating extensive intimal calcifications What the clinician needs to know
Complications:
The complications of a Penetrating Atherosclerotic Ulcer include: However most patients have a poor prognosis because of generalized atherosclerosis leading to diffuse organ failure. E. Casta?er et al, Radiographics 2003; 23:S93- S110

LI-RADS:

Liver Imaging Reporting And Data System:
Frederieke Elsinger*, Christopher Lunt, Alison Harris and Silvia Chang
Luzerner Kantonsspital* and Vancouver General Hospital:
Publicationdate 26-3-2020 The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a classification system for liver lesions which is used in patients with liver cirrhosis and chronic HBV without cirrhosis, because these patients have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The LI-RADS category reflects the probability of HCC and is based on the typical CT and MR-findings in HCC. LI-RADS is not meant to be used in patients <18 years or patients with cirrhosis due to congenital hepatic fibrosis or due to vascular disorders, because these patients have a lower chance of developing HCC. Press ctrl+for larger images and text on a PC or ⌘+ on a Mac.
Single images can be enlarged by clicking on them.
Introduction:

LI-RADS major features:
There are five major features which are typically seen in HCC in patients with livercirrhosis and  chronic hepatitis B virus infection (fig). L4*/L5: enhancing capsule is L4. Non-peripheral washout or threshold growth is L5.
LI-RADS categories:
Non enhancing lesions in a cirrhotic liver, compatible with cysts, LR-1
Mass versus Pseudolesion:
LI-RADS uses the term ‘observations’ to describe focal abnormalities which are distinct from the background liver parenchyma. 
It is preferred not to use the word ‘lesion’ or ‘nodule’ as some of these abnormalities do not represent true lesions but are the result of a perfusion alteration, a hypertrophic pseudomass or an artifact.
When to use LI-RADS:
LI-RADS can only be used in patients with cirrhosis and chronic HBV infection. LI-RADS should not be used in patients with cirrhosis caused by vascular disorders (see table).
In these patients the formation of benign hyperplastic nodules may resemble HCC on imaging and cause false positive diagnoses.
Major features:
Typical HCC with APHE and washout.
Arterial Phase non-rim Hyperenhancement (APHE):
Here an image in the late arterial phase in a patient with cirrhosis. 
There is an observation with non-rim hyperenhancement (yellow arrow).
In a late phase there is washout.
These are typical features of HCC. The other lesion (green arrow) is a treated lesion, which we will discuss later. Typical HCC with APHE, washout and enhancing capsule
Washout - Capsule:
This is another patient with an enhancing lesion and washout. 
Note also the enhancing capsule on the delayed phase. A capsule is one of the major features of HCC and can be complete or partial. 
A capsule should always be included within the measurement of the lesion. LEFT: Hyperenhancing observation detected in segment 5. RIGHT: follow up 3 months later shows growth.
Size - Threshold growth:
Size also determines in which category a lesion is placed.
The bigger the lesion, the higher the chance that it is a HCC. An observation should be measured in the phase, sequence or plane in which margins are the most clear.
Measurement on the arterial phase and DWI sequence should be avoided as size could be overestimated due to summation of perilesional enhancement and anatomic distortion respectively. Threshold growth is also an important finding.
It is defined as more than 50% growth in less than 6 months The images show an observation in segment 5 of the liver demonstrating arterial hyperenhancement.
The lesion has grown from 8 mm to 21 mm in 3 months, which means that there is threshold growth.
LI-RADS 1 - definitely benign:
Observations in this category are definitely benign. Examples of LR-1 lesions are definite: The images show lesions that show no enhancement in both late arterial, portal venous and delayed phase. Typical haemangioma in a patient with livercirrhosis.
LI-RADS 2 - probably benign:
LR-2 observations are probably benign.
Of all LR-2 lesions about 16% are HCC and 18% are malignant. Examples of LR-2 lesions are probable: Distinct nodules < 20 mm without malignant features (see section of ancillary malignant features) can be categorized as LR-2. Examples are nodules which are T1 hyperintense, T2 hypointense, siderotic or hepatobiliary phase hyperintense. The CT-images show a lesion with enhancement that follows the bloodpool, which is typical for a hemangioma. Continue with the MR of this patient. MRI-images of the same patient. The enhancement of this lesion follows the enhancement of the blood pool.
LI-RADS 3 - intermediate probability:
LR-3 observations vary from benign lesions to dysplastic nodules to HCC. 
Many LR-3s are vascular pseudolesions. 
Of all LR-3 lesions approximately 37% are HCC and 39% are malignant (1). Lesions that are placed in category LI-RADS 3 are: Study the MR-images. What are the findings?
How would you score LI-RADS. The findings are: The lesion was classified as LI-RADS 3. LI-RADS 3 Here another small hyperenhancing lesion without any additional feature like washout, capsule or threshold growth. This was also classified as LI-RADS 3. LI-RADS 3 Arterial, PV and delayed phase images of a LIRADS 3 observation. 
In segment 5 there is a subcapsular observation of intense arterial enhancement without washout in the PV or delayed phase. LIRADS 4. Small area of arterial enhancement and washout posterior in segment 7 measuring 9 mm.
LI-RADS 4 - probably HCC:
Of all LR-4 observations about 74% are HCC and 81% are malignant (1). The categorizing of an observation as LR-4 depends on the size of the lesion, the presence of APHE and the amount of additional major features (see LIRADS table). Here a very small lesion which measures less than 10 mm with nonrim arterial hyperenhancement and one additional feature, i.e. LI-RADS 4.
LI-RADS 5 - definitely HCC:
Study the MR-images. 
What are the major findings and what are additional findings?
How would you score LI-RADS. Major features - which makes this a  LR-5 lesion: Ancillary features - which we will discuss in a moment: Here we did fill in the findings in the table: This is a LR-5 lesion. Of all LR-5 lesions 95% are HCC and 98% are malignant.
In patients with concurrent extra-hepatic malignancy the positive predictive value of LR-5 for HCC drops, especially if the primary tumor is hypervascular. 
When in doubt, categorizing a lesion as LR-M might be more appropriate in this group of patients. LR-5 The images show an arterially enhancing lesion with washout in segment VI. suspicious of HCC: LR-5. Note that the arterial enhancement is faint because the patient is scanned in the early arterial phase instead of the late arterial phase in which HCC has it’s peak enhancement. Additional small lesions can therefore be easily missed. LR-tumor in vein
LR-TIV - tumor in vein:
The classification LR-TIV should be applied when there is unequivocal soft tissue within a vein, regardless if an associated mass is seen or not. 
Almost always the venous invasion by tumor is related to a HCC.
LR-TIV is a contraindication to liver transplantation.
Malignancies other than HCC may also invade the portal venous system. Additional clues of possible venous invasion by tumor are: LR-tumor in vein The images show an only mild rim-like arterially enhancing lesion in segment V with washout.
A linear area of hypoenhancement is seen extending from the mass which is suspicious of tumor in vein (yellow arrow). 
Since we are not absolutely sure that it is a tumor thrombus, we cannot categorize this as LR-TIV. A follow up CT was done, showing severe progression of the tumor as well as vascular involvement of the anterior right portal vein (white arrow). 
Now we are sure of tumor invasion in the portal vein.
LR-M - malignant:
The category of LR-M should be applied to malignant appearing lesions that do not have the typical characteristics of HCC. Non-HCC malignant lesions either show: Categorizing a lesion as LR-M does not mean the diagnosis of  HCC is excluded. 
Of all LR-M lesions 2/3 are non-HCC malignancies like intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (CCA) or combined HCC-CCA and about 5% are benign. 
This small percentage of benign malignant appearing lesions usually represent sclerosing hemangiomas or abscesses. Click to enlarge Tumor markers Evaluation of circulating tumor biomarkers such as AFP and CA19-9 can be helpful to refine the differential diagnosis. Cholangiocarcinoma LR-M The images show a large rim enhancing mass in the late arterial phase in a patient with chronic hepatitis.
In the portal venous phase there is progressive peripheral enhancement. Pathology diagnosis confirmed this was not a HCC but a cholangiocarcinoma Mixed HCC-iCCA LR-M The images show a large, heterogeneous enhancing lesion in segment II. There is peripheral enhancement in the portal venous phase. There is high signal on T1 IP and OOP imaging and diffusion restriction. This lesion was resected and pathology showed a mixed HCC-iCCA.
Ancillary features:
Ancillary features are findings that are helpful for detection improvement, increase in confidence for favoring the diagnosis HCC versus non-HCC malignancy or benignity or can lead to category adjustment. 
These features are not obligatory and can be used at the radiologist’s discretion. 
In case of category adjustment, observations can only be upgraded or downgraded one category. 
However you are not allowed to upgrade from LR-4 to LR-5, because these ancillary features lack sufficient specificity for HCC to allow for an LR-5 upgrade.
Features favoring HCC:
Non-enhancing capsuleis a feature of a capsule surrounding an observation not appearing as an enhancing rim. Nodule in nodule is a nodule within a larger nodule with different imaging characteristics
Mosaic structureis randomly distributed compartments or nodules within an observation, usually with different imaging features.
Blood products in mass isintralesional or perilesional hemorrhage in the absence of biopsy or trauma.
Fat in mass isexcess of fat within the whole or part of the mass, more than in adjacent liver. Can be large extracellular fat or intracellular.
Nodule in nodule:
The images show a fat containing lesion with arterial hyperenhancement.
Within this lesion there is a nodule (arrow) with wash out and a capsule. The lesion was classified as LR-5.
Mosaic architecture:
The image shows an observation with hyperenhancement in the late arterial phase in a patient with cirrhosis.
Notice the mosaic architecture. IP and OOP image
Blood products in mass:
Study the MR-images.
What are the findings? The findings are high signal in a mass in segment II both on an in-phase image as well as on the out-of-phase image (arrow). This represents internal hemorrhage and in the absence of biopsy or trauma, is a feature that favors the diagnosis of HCC. HCC classified as LI-RADS 5.
Fat in mass:
Excess of fat in the whole or part of a mass is an ancillary finding that favors the diagnosis of HCC. Same image as shown earlier.
What are the findings? The findings are: This was classified as LI-RADS 5. Study the MR-images. What are the findings? The findings are: Continue with next image... Based on the findings on the images shown above, the lesion is classified as LI-RADS 5 because it is larger that 20mm and shows hyperenhancement and washout with a capsule. The ancillary features favoring HCC are intracellular fat on IP/OOP imaging and diffusion restriction.
Now we can not go any higher than LI-RADS 5, but the additional features will give us extra confidence in the diagnosis.
Diffusion restriction:
In this patient with cirrhosis the MR-images show an arterially enhancing observation (< 2 cm) in the right lobe (arrow). 
As there is no washout or any other major feature observed this should be classified as a LR-3 lesion. 
However due to the ancillary finding of diffusion restriction this observation can be upgraded to a LR-4. This is a difficult topic, since diffusion restriction can also be seen in non-HCC tumors. If there is doubt between the diagnosis of possible HCC and another type of malignancy a diagnostic biopsy can be considered.
Favoring non-HCC Malignancy:
The table shows an overview of ancillary features favoring not HCC specific malignancy.
Features favoring benignity:
The table shows an overview of benign ancillary features. Siderotic nodules The images are of a patient with liver cirrhosis.
On the T2W-images there are multiple small nodules which are of low signal on the T2-weighted images.
This is due to the T2 shortening of iron. 
This feature favors benignity. There is no contrast enhancement of the lesions.
Management:

LRTR - LI-RADS treatment response:
Evaluation of treatment response A different algorithm was created for the categorization of treated lesions. 
Examples of locoregional therapies are radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol ablation, cryoablation, microwave ablation, transarterial embolization or chemoembolization, doxirubicin-eluted bead chemoembolization, transarterial radioembolization and external beam radiotherapy. These lesions are either characterized as non evaluable, nonviable, equivocal or viable. 
Treatment related parenchymal perfusional changes may mimic or obscure residual tumor, potentially leading to false positive or false negative assessment of viability.
If there is any uncertainty between two categories, the one reflecting lower certainty should be applied. LI-RADS does not apply for systemic treatment. LRTR non viable If an observation shows no residual major or ancillary features or has completely disappeared it can be characterized as non-viable. If typical post-treatment features are noted in the area of treatment and there are no signs of residual malignancy, a lesion can be considered as non viable. The images show an ablation defect in segment V adjacent to gallbladder  and hepatic vein without residual areas of arterial enhancement or washout.
This was classified as  LRTR non viable. LRTR non-viable The image in the late arterial phase show normal post treatment pattern with rim-like hyperenhancement of the surrounding liver parenchyma due to hyperemia after DEB-TACE (arrow). DEB TACE is drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization, a relative new endovascular treatment based on the use of microspheres to release chemotherapeutic agents within a target lesion with controlled pharmacokinetics. 
DEB-TACE nowadays represents one of the most used treatments for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. LRTR non-viable Arterial enhancing lesions which were treated with Deb TACE. There is mild perilesional enhancement noted on the follow-up scan, which is a normal post-treatment finding. LRTR equivocal The enhancement pattern is atypical for treatment-specific expected enhancement and otherwise not meeting criteria for probably or definitely viable. 
For some treatments early post-treatment enhancement patterns may not reliably differentiate viable from non viable tumor and therefore the most appropriate category in this early post-treatment period may be LRTR equivocal. Area of arterial enhancement without washout in a segment 5 ablation defect (arrow), LRTR-equivocal. LRTR viable When measuring viable tumor only the largest continuous area of enhancement or washout should be measured (not traversing non enhancing area). 
If residual enhancement  within a lesion is nodular, the largest nodule should be reported. LRTR viable If a new tumor arises adjacent to a treated lesion this observation should be assigned a new non-treated LIRADS category. If a new observation is noted at the surgical margin it should be assigned a category according to the treated lesion algorithm. The coronal images shows a large lesion treated with TACE with residual areas of mild arterial enhancement and washout due to untreated supply via a phrenic artery (yellow arrow): LRTR-viable. Continue with the axial image ... Note there is irregularity of the peritoneal fat anteriorly due to capsular rupture (arrow). LRTR viable Previous segment II resection with viable tumor at the resection margin. 
Note the area of arterial enhancement and washout adjacent to the surgical clips (arrows).
This is  LRTR-viable.
Summary:

Hypervascular metastases:
Hypervascular metastases are sometimes difficult to differentiate from HCC because of their similar arterial enhancement pattern, especially when multiple lesions ae present. 
Screening for HCC risk factors and patient history of primary tumors which can give hypervascular metastases (RCC, breast, neuroendocrine, melanoma, thyroid, choriocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma) can be helpful in those cases. 
Also absence of the typical HCC imaging characteristics should raise suspicion of another type of malignancy. These are all images of a patient without cirrhosis, so we cannot use LI-RADS.
There are multiple heterogenous lesions with mild peripheral enhancement in the arterial phase. 
Some lesions are mildly hypodense compared to adjacent liver parenchyma on the portal phase and larger lesions have a necrotic center. 
Multiplicity and targetoid enhancement pattern are not typical for HCC and suggestive of metastatic disease. This patient had a neuroendocrine tumor with liver metastases. These images are of a patient with a steatotic liver.
Although some of these patient have a mildly greater chance of developing HCC, we cannot use LI-RADS. There are  multiple lesions which are hyperenhancing in the arterial and portal venous phase. This is another example of hypervascular metastases.
This patient was known to have a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas.
Protocols:
Early aterial phase (left). Late arterial phase (right). CT protocol Required images for CT are late-arterial, portal venous and delayed phase. 
Precontrast images are recommended after locoregional treatment. Late arterial phase
This phase refers to the hepatic arterial phase in which the hepatic artery and branches are fully enhanced and the hepatic veins are not yet enhancing. HCC usually enhances more strongly in the late arterial phase showing early enhancement of the portal vein and is therefore preferred over the early arterial phase, when there is no enhancement of PV and poor enhancement of the HCC. Notice poor enhancement of liver and portal vein (white arrow) in the early arterial phase and good enhancement of both hepatic artery (white arrow) and portal vein (green arrow) in the late arterial phase. Portal venous phase Portal venous phaseThere is complete enhancement of the portal veins with antegrade filling of hepatic veins. 
In this phase the normal liver parenchyma is usually at its peak of enhancement.
Hypovascular lesions like most metastases are best detected in this phase, but hypervascular lesions are poorly seen because there is poor contrast between the good enhancement of the liver parenchyma and the hypervascular lesion. Delayed phase Delayed phase Portal and hepatic veins are enhanced but less than in the portal venous phase. 
Liver parenchyma is enhanced but also less than in PV phase.
This phase is typically acquired 2-5 min after injection. This phase is helpful in detecting wash out of HCC and in detecting sclerotic lesions like cholangiocarcinoma or sclerotic metastases like sometimes seen in breast cancer. Hepatobiliary phase study: diffuse uptake of contrast by normal liver parenchyma with hypointense appearance of the vessels and contrast excreted within the bile ducts. MRI protocol The required sequences for MRI are: Transitional phaseThis phase is acquired with a hepatobiliary contrast agent after the extracellular phase but before the hepatobiliary phase.
Liver vessels and hepatic parenchyma are of similar intensity. Typically acquired 2-5 min after injection. Hepatobiliary phaseThis phase is acquired with a hepatobiliary agent. 
Liver parenchyma is hyperintense to the hepatic vessels. There is excretion of contrast in the biliary system. 
Typically acquired about 20 min after injection of gadoxetate or 1-3 hours after gadobenate.
Neonatal Brain US:
Erik Beek and Floris Groenendaal
Department of Radiology and Neonatology of the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital and the University Medical Centre of Utrecht, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2006-04-01 Cranial sonography (US) is the most widely used neuroimaging procedure in premature infants. US helps in assessing the neurologic status of the child, since clinical examination and symptoms are often nonspecific. It gives information about immediate and long term prognosis. by Erik Beek and Floris Groenendaal
Introduction:
Use both the sector and linear transducer and examine the greater fontanel and if necessary also the lesser and sphenoidal fontanel. Ultrasound is a fast and bedside examination which makes it ideal for premature infants. Try to get all the information you can. Do not limit yourself to only one transducer or only one acustic window (figure). Generally the large fontanel is used as acoustic window. The small fontanel however is a good window to the occipital lobes. This can be usefull in patients with borderline hyperechogenicity in these areas. Disadvantages of US are:
Peri Ventricular Leukomalacia (PVL):
PVL is also known as Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) of the preterm. It is a white matter disease that affects the periventricular zones. In prematures this white matter zone is a watershed zone between deep and superficial vessels. Until recently ischemia was thought to be the single cause of PVL, but probably other causes (infection, vasculitis) play an additional role. PVL presents as areas of increased periventricular echogenicity. Normally the echogenicity of the periventricular white matter should be less than the echogenicity of the choroid plexus. PVL occurs most commonly in premature infants born at less than 33 weeks gestation (38% PVL) and less than 1500 g birth weight (45% PVL). Detection of PVL is important because a significant percentage of surviving premature infants with PVL develop cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment or visual disturbances. More than 50% of infants with PVL or grade III hemmorrhage develop cerebral palsy.
Grading PVL:
PVL is graded according to the signs as listed in the Table on the left. Regular sonographic examination is mandatory as cysts in PVL can develop as long as 4 weeks after birth (especially in prematures
Cranial ultrasonographic findings may be normal in patients who go on to develop clinical and delayed imaging findings of PVL. A good protocol is US-examination at least once a week until discharge
?nd at the age of 40 weeks. Sagittal image of a child with PVL grade 1 PVL grade 1 PVL is diagnosed as grade 1 if there are areas of increased periventricular echogenicity without any cyst formation persisting for more than 7 days. Increased periventricular echogenicity is however a nonspecific finding that must be differentiated from the normal periventricular halo or normal hyperechoic 'blush' posterosuperior to the ventricular trigones. Suspect PVL if the echogenicity is asymmetric, coarse, globular or more hyperechoic than the choroid plexus. The abnormal periventricular echotexture of PVL usually disappears at 2-3 weeks. PVL can be differentiated from hemorrhages because PVL lacks mass effect. Transverse and sagittal image of a child with PVL grade 2. PVL grade 2 The images on the left demonstrate a PVL grade 2 with small periventricular cysts. The echogenicity has resolved at the time of cyst formation. 2% of the preterm neonates born before 32 weeks develop cystic PVL. The severity of PVL is related to the size and distribution of these cysts. Cystic PVL has been identified on cranial ultrasounds on the first day of life, indicating that the adverse event was at least 2 weeks prenatal rather than perinatal or postnatal. US is highly reliable in the detection of cystic WM injury (PVL grade II or more), but has significant limitations in the demonstration of noncystic WM injury (PVL grade I). This deficiency of neonatal cranial US is important, because noncystic WM injury is considerably more common than cystic WM injury. Sagittal image demonstarting extensive PVL grade 3 PVL grade 3 PVL is diagnosed as grade 3 if there are areas of increased periventricular echogenicity, that develop into extensive periventricular cysts in the occipital and fronto-parietal region. Coronal and transverse images demonstrating PVL grade 4 PVL grade 4 PVL is diagnosed as grade 4 if there are areas of increased periventricular echogenicity in the deep white matter developing into extensive subcortical cysts. PVL grade 4 is seen mostly in fullterm neonates as opposed to PVL grade 1-3, which is a disease of the preterm neonate.
Flaring persisting beyond the first week of life is by definition PVL garde 1.
Flaring:
Transverse and sagittal images demonstrating flaring in a premature infant. The term flaring is used to describe the slightly echogenic periventricular zones, that are seen in many premature infants in the first week of life. During this first week it is not sure if this is a normal variant or a sign of PVL grade 1. Flaring persisting beyond the first week of life is by definition PVL grade 1. LEFT: Initial examination shows flaring.RIGHT: Follow up one week later shows normal periventricular white matter. Follow up is needed to differentiate flaring from PVL grade I. The case on the left shows a premature infant with flaring. At follow up no cyst formation was found and after the first week a normal periventricular white matter was seen.
Germinal Matrix Hemorrhage:
Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is also known as periventricular hemorrhage or preterm caudothalamic hemorrhage. These germinal matrix hemorrhages occur in the highly vascular but also stress sensitive germinal matrix, which is located in the caudothalamic groove. This is the subependymal region between the caudate nucleus and thalamus. Most infants are asymptomatic or demonstrate subtle signs that are easily overlooked. These hemorhages are subsequently found on surveillance sonography. Grade 1 intracranial hemorrhageSagittal and coronal US of subependymal hemorrhage located in the groove between the thalamus and the nucleus caudatus. Grade 1 intracranial hemorrhage On the left an intracranial hemorrhage confined to the caudothalamic groove. It is staged as grade 1 hemorrhage. In the acute phase these bleedings are hyperechoic, changing to iso- and hypo-echoic with time. Sagittal and coronal US of a grade 2 hemorrhage Grade 2 intracranial hemorrhage On the left a grade 2 intracranial hemorrhage. On the coronal image only the cavum septi pellucidi is seen. Both lateral ventricles are filled with blood, but there is no ventricular dilatation. On the left the same patient after 3 days. The ventricles are dilated and clot formation is seen. Secondary hydrocephalus occuring several days after a grade 2 bleed should not be mislabeled as grade 3 hemorrhage. LEFT: Coronal image, green arrow indicating grade 3 hemorrhageRIGHT: Sagittal image, yellow arrow indicating venous infarction. Grade 3 intracranial hemorrhage On the left a grade 3 intracranial hemorrhage filling the left lateral ventricle. Also note the wedge shaped hyperechoic area on the laterosuperior side of the ventricle. This represents a small venous infarction. Yellow arrow indicating cyst formation within venous infarction. Same patient as above. Two weeks later the venous infarction has developed into a hypoechoic area with cyst formation. Intracranial hemorrhage grade 4 Grade 4 intracranial hemorrhage Originally these grade 4 hemorrhages were thought to result from subependymal bleeding into the adjacent brain. Today however most regard these grade 4 hemorrhages to be venous hemorrhagic infartions, which are the result of compression of the outflow of the veins by the subependymal hemorrhage. On the left a grade 4 hemorrhage. There is a large subependymal bleeding but also a large area with increased echogenicity in the brain parenchyma lateral to the ventricle. This is probably the result of a venous infarct. These venous infarctions resolve with cyst formation. These cysts can merge with the lateral ventricle, finally resulting into a porencephalic cyst. On the left a different patient with a grade 4 hemorrhage at a later stage with extensive cyst formation. Grade 1 and 2 bleeds generally have a good prognosis. Grade 3 and 4 bleeds have variable long-term deficits, but outcome in grade 3 hemorrhages is usually good when no parenchymal injury has occurred. Hydrocephalus is a common complication and many infants require ventriculoperitoneal shunting. The mechanisms by which hydrocephalus develop include:
Normal Variants:
Common variants are listed in the Table on the left. LEFT: Coronal image. Cavum septi pellucidi is seen in between the lateral ventricles.RIGHT: Midsagittal image demonstrating a cavum vergae.
Cavum septi pellucidi, cavum vergae and cavum of the velum interpositum:
Well known variants are the cavum of the septum pellucidum and the cavum vergae. The more premature the baby, the more frequently these cavities are present. They can persist until adulthood. A less frequently seen variant is the cavum of the velum interpositum. This presents as a cyst-like structure in the region of the tectum. It's shape is compared to a helmet. It can easily be confused with a subarachnoid cyst or a cyst of the pineal gland.
Choroid plexus cyst:
In postnatal US these cysts of the chorio?d plexus are often incidental findings without clinical consequences. Choroid plexus cysts (CPC) are however of importance for obstetricians. At prenatal US these cysts can be predictive of trisomy 18. About half of babies with Trisomy 18 show a CPC on ultrasound, but nearly all of these babies will also have other abnormalities on the ultrasound, especially in the heart, hand, and feet. An exeption must be made for cysts that arise close to the foramen of Monro. Although these cysts often disappear spontaneously, follow up US is necessary to ensure disappearance. Some may produce symptoms of raised intracranial pressure due to obstruction to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow.
Benign macrocrania:
Benign macrocrania is also known as extraventricular obstructive hydrocephalus. This is seen in children between 6 months and 2 years. The head circumference is above the 97th percentile. After the age of 2 years the head size normalizes. Often the mother or father of the child had large heads at that age. The cause is not known. Most state that it is a normal condition, although some state that these children have a slight developmental delay. LEFT: Normal subarachnoid space is RIGHT: avoid pressure on the fontanel. When children with a large head are presented for US, examine the superficial subarachnoid space and the ventricles.
The normal subarachnoid space measures less then 3 mm. The ventricles are often slightly enlarged. These prominent subarachnoid space and ventricular system in these children should not be interpreted as cerebral atrophia, as in atrophia there is a small head circumpherence.
Mineralizing vasculopathy:
Mineralizing vasculopathy can be seen in the thalamostriatal and lenticulostriatal arteries and is caused by calcification of the arterial wall. A wide range of perinatal, acquired, and nonspecific clinical conditions may result in this sonographic finding. In the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital these children used to be tested for TORCH-infection, but currently the only test that is done is a urine-test for CMV. Germinolytic cysts Are located at the caudothalamic groove. They are tear shaped. There are no signs of intracerebral hemorrhage and these children have no neurological sequelae. The etiology is not known. Pseudocyst These are also called coarctation of the lateral ventricle. They are often bilaterally and have no neurological sequelae 1+2 = germinolytic cysts and pseudocysts, 3 = cystic periventricular leukomalacia, 4 = cysts as a result of a venous infarct
Cysts:
If cysts are seen around the lateral ventricles, it is important to determine their position in regard to the upper part of the lateral ventricle (figure).
Ventricular measurement:
Measurement of the ventricular system should be done in an easy reproducible sonographic plane. Use a coronal section through the lateral ventricles slightly posterior to the foramen of Monro. You will see 3 echogenic dots representing the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles and in the roof of the third ventricle. Furthermore you should see a symmetrical image of the Sylvian fissure on both sides and the hippocampus (green and orange arrows).
Levene index:
Up to 40 weeks of gestational age the Levene-index should be used and after 40 weeks the ventricular index. The Levene index is the absolute distance between the falx and the lateral wall of the anterior horn in the coronal plane at the level of the third ventricle. This is performed for the left and right side. These measurements can be compared to the reference curve and are quite usefull for further follow-up. LEFT: Standard measurement of the ventricular index.RIGHT: There is ballooning of the ventricles and the index measurement underestimates the severity of the ventricular widening.
Ventricular index:
After 40 weeks the ventricular index or frontal horn ratio should be used, i.e. the ratio of the distance between the lateral sides of the ventricles and the biparietal diameter. When using this ratio you have to realise, that when the ventricular system widens, the frontal horns tend to enlarge in the craniocaudal direction more than in the left to right dimension. Measurement of the falx to the most lateral point of the lateral ventricle. Real-time ultrasound was used to make exact measurements from the lateral wall of the body of the lateral ventricle to the falx (the ventricular index) in 273 infants of varying gestational ages (5). The measurement performed in an axial plane through the temporoparietal bone correlated closely with an actual measurement made in coronal plane in 50 infants. A cross-sectional centile chart was drawn up of the normal range for this measurement from 27 to 42 weeks' postmenstrual age. A further chart showing the rate of change of the ventricular index allowed growth of the ventricles to be assessed in a longitudinal manner. Use of these charts permits early detection of hydrocephalus or dilated ventricles secondary to cerebral atrophy. A more realiable indicator of widening of the ventricular system would be an area- or volume-measurement. This however is more time consuming. So although ventricular index has shortcommings it is still the most commonly used. In general practise, studying the images by eye is reliable, provided, that standard planes are used. by Paul Govaert, Gent University Hospital and Linda S. de Vries, Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis. with contributions of Frank van Bel, Erik Beek, Dirk Voet, An Bael, Linde Goossens

Cartilage tumors:

with special attention to Atypical Cartilaginous Tumors:
Kirsten van Langevelde and Robin Smithuis
Leiden University Medical Center and the Alrijne hospital in Leiden, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 29-08-2023 Cartilage or chondroid tumors are a heterogeneous group of bone
tumors that all share a chondroid matrix.
They range from benign enchondromas
to highly malignant chondrosarcomas.
Low-grade chondrosarcomas of the long
bones have been classified as an
intermediate group and are
now called atypical cartilaginous tumor (ACT), because these
tumors rarely metastasize and have a better
clinical outcome compared to the same tumor in the axial skeleton. The recommended treatment of ACT has
changed over the years from resection to curettage
and even "watchful waiting" with MRI follow-up [1].
Due to these changes in management, imaging plays a
major role in the diagnosis and follow up of ACT. In this article we will discuss: Follow up of ACT. Introduction
Introduction:
Cartilage tumors share the characteristic production of a chondroid matrix with frequently typical matrix calcifications.
They vary in severity from benign enchondromas and locally aggressive atypical cartilaginous tumors (ACT) to malignant chondrosarcomas.
About 10% of chondrosarcomas are dedifferentiated, which is a highly malignant variant of chondrosarcoma. Atypical cartilaginous tumors (ACT)
have been classified as intermediate grade chondroid tumors by the World Health
Organization in 2013. “Intermediate”
means that these tumors may behave locally aggressive but rarely
metastasize (< 2%). Since 2020 intermediate lesions in the appendicular skeleton are called ACT, while the same lesions
located in the axial skeleton are called chondrosarcoma grade I (CS-I) because they have a poorer outcome. The term CS-I is therefore reserved for these tumors in the
axial skeleton, meaning the spine,
pelvis, ribs, sternum, scapula and
skull base. Task of the radiologist
Enchondromas are benign and do not need follow up.
High grade chondrosarcomas are treated with wide resection, since they are insensitive to chemotherapy and radiation.
For ACTs watchful waiting
with MRI follow up is replacing surgical intervention in many centers.
Given these developments,
the most important task for the musculoskeletal radiologist is to differentiate
ACTs from high grade chondrosarcomas.
Terminology in Chondroid tumors:
This figure demonstrates
examples to explain the terminology used to describe chondroid tumors. In some examples there can
be more than one typical finding.
How to diagnose a Chondroid tumor:

X-ray:
On radiographs, chondroid tumors show
foci of nodular, popcorn-like matrix mineralization. These calcifications may be present within the entire spectrum of
chondroid tumors. Often the tumor
size is underestimated on a radiograph, as frequently only the mineralized part of the
tumor is visible. In the phalanges,
enchondromas may present as purely osteolytic tumors, not necessarily
containing matrix calcifications. Image
There is a small area of 1.5 cm with popcorn calcifications in the distal metaphysis of the femur without extension to the cortex. 
This is an enchondroma. Images
The radiograph demonstrates an
osteolytic lesion in the distal femur containing typical popcorn calcifications
and showing anterior cortical scalloping (arrowhead). On the sagittal MRI we can appreciate
that the tumor is larger than the area of calcifications on the radiograph,
measuring 8 cm. 
The tumor is hyperintense on T2 STIR and contains multiple foci
of low signal intensity, corresponding to the chondroid matrix calcifications
on the radiograph. Conclusion
Since there is no periosteal reaction or soft tissue mass, these findings fit with the diagnosis of ACT. 
The patient remains in follow-up.
CT:
CT is not part of the routine imaging work-up in chondroid tumors,
however it may aid in the detection of subtle matrix mineralization in case
there is doubt about the diagnosis. CT can also be helpful in axial
lesions where radiographs are not sufficient - such as the skull base or pelvis
- to quantify bone destruction and the extent of the tumor. If there is doubt about cortical
destruction in an expansile lesion on MR, CT will usually clearly demonstrate
the presence or absence of a cortex. 
Finally,
CT is useful to assess pathological fractures and for example to assess whether
these extend into a joint. Images MRI cor T1W-image shows an eccentric,
slightly expansile lesion in the caput and collum of the right femur. It is difficult to appreciate whether
the medial cortex is only thinned or destructed. Therefore an unenhanced CT was done
in addition. Unenhanced CT demonstrates a lytic
lesion containing chondroid matrix calcifications. There is cortical scalloping
medially, but no cortical destruction. Curettage was performed to exclude a clear cell chondrosarcoma. This is
a rare subtype of chondrosarcoma which occurs in the epiphysis of long bones in
young adults. Pathology diagnosis: ACT.
MR:
On fluid sensitive sequences - preferably T2W with fat suppression - cartilage nodules are hyperintense and grouped together. 
After gadolinium contrast administration, cartilage tumors enhance with a typical septonodular enhancement.
This feature is helpful in distinguishing cartilage tumors from other bone tumors.
Calcifications can be visible on MRI and show low signal intensity on all sequences. Unfortunately, diffusion weighted
imaging has been shown not to be of use in differentiating low grade from high
grade cartilage tumors. Interspersed fatChondroid nodules may have
fatty marrow between them, also called interspersed or entrapped fat. This is best assessed on
T1-weighted images and is present in lesions at the benign side of the
spectrum, so in ACTs. For example, during follow
up of ACTs, the amount of interspersed fat and calcifications may increase,
which can be interpreted as “maturation” of a lesion.
This may
even cause decrease in size of the tumor over time. Both fatty maturation and
increased calcification of a chondroid tumor over time are signs of benignity. ScallopingCartilage tumors may cause scalloping
of the cortex, which appears as sharp osteolysis extending from the marrow
cavity. The Birmingham group proposed the
BACTIP criteria for MRI assessment of chondroid tumors and guidance towards referral to a
tertiary center or end of follow up. BACTIP defined scalloping as
localized if less than 10% of the lesion circumference was involved, measured
on an axial slice with the largest tumor diameter. Whereas scalloping of more than 10%
of the lesion circumference was defined as extensive. Relevance of the depth of cortical
scalloping remains unclear. Image
The axial T1 SPIR post contrast shows cortical scalloping anteriorly over approximately 43/360 degrees.
This means scalloping of 12% of the tumor circumference (extensive).
Also note more subtle posterior cortical scalloping (arrowhead).
This tumor shows septonodular, peripheral enhancement.
Note the low signal intensity foci in keeping with calcifications. Figure courtesy of Wouter Stomp MR perfusion
Perfusion or dynamic contrast
enhanced MRI is a functional imaging technique in which early enhancement of
the tumor is monitored after an intravenous gadolinium bolus injection.
In cartilage tumors, perfusion has been used to differentiate
enchondroma from chondrosarcomas. A cut off of 10 seconds is used for
fast versus slow enhancement. However, overlap in early enhancement patterns of
chondroid tumors may occur, for example: fast enhancing enchondromas exist,
but also slow enhancing ACTs. Images
There is a tumor of less than 2 cm in the distal femur metaphysis. 
The lesion is hyperintense on T2, iso-intense on T1 and shows septonodular enhancement. There is no relation with the cortex. On the perfusion images (time intensity curve) the tumor shows slow enhancement, starting approximately 20 seconds post arterial enhancement. 
This is an enchondroma and needs no follow up. Read more on MR perfusion here
PET-CT:
As for 18F-FDG-PET-CT, SUVmax was shown to correlate with
histologic grade in chondroid tumors. 
SUVmax < 2 supports the diagnosis of a benign
tumor, while SUVmax > 4.5 is suggestive of higher grade
chondrosarcoma. 
However, as the majority of ACT/grade
I lesions ends up in an intermediate category with overlapping values (SUVmax 2- 4.5), PET CT is not recommended
to differentiate cartilage tumors. Whole body PET CT may be useful in detecting metastases in
dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. Image

Enchondroma:
Enchondromas are considered a “cartilage rest”.
Hence the close relation to the epiphyseal growth plate, often within 2 cm. 
Enchondromas are mostly found in the proximal humerus, distal femur or proximal tibia metaphyses.
These benign lesions occur as incidental findings in 3% of all knee MRIs and need no follow up. 
Enchondromas may slowly grow over time or even regress in size.
Growth itself is not a sign that the lesion has become malignant. Enchondromas are typically smaller than 5 cm and 80% of enchondromas in the long bones is smaller than 2 cm.
Variable size cut offs are proposed to differentiate enchondroma from ACT and chondrosarcomas.
In the BACTIP-criteria a cut off of 4 cm is used to decide whether a lesion should be followed up or not. In our institution we use 5
cm as a cut off, however keep in mind that there is no definitive size cutoff
value and you should always rule out aggressive features, since there can be
high grade chondrosarcomas smaller than 5 cm that grow through the cortex and
have an accompanying soft tissue mass. Images courtesy of Wouter Stomp Typical
enchondroma
The images show two small lesions adjacent to the physis in the distal femur metaphysis, representing small cartilage rests without
relation to the cortex or perilesional bone marrow edema.
No follow up is
needed.
Enchondroma versus ACT:
Over time, treatment of ACT has
shifted towards the conservative side, i.e. watchful waiting or “wait and scan” by
MRI instead of curettage. This has implications for
radiologists too, as the main task is now to decide which lesions we want to
follow up. In our tertiary referral centre, we
follow up lesions that extend up to the cortex. This means that independent of size,
we consider possible growth through the cortex in the future an indication for follow up.
See the table with our follow op schedule for ACT below. Case
First look at the images.
What are the findings?
Then continue reading. Images X-ray: An area of chondroid calcifications is present in the distal femur
diaphysis without cortical scalloping. MRI: Sag T1W-image shows the multinodular
cartilage tumor without contact with the anterior or posterior cortex. The
lesion measures 38 mm. The axial T1 shows no cortical
scalloping. Conclusion Enchondroma. PearlFor lesions  < 5 cm, as long as the cartilage lesion does not reach the cortex,
and there is no surrounding bone marrow oedema or periostitis, we consider it
an enchondroma.  No follow up is needed. Case First look at the images. What are the findings? Then continue reading. Images The X-ray shows shows a small area of
popcorn calcifications in the distal diaphysis. The MR-images show a 4.6 cm lesion in the distal femur diaphysis with extension up to the
cortex (wall- to-wall filling). Note that the lesion appears smaller
on the radiograph due to limited calcifications. The calcifications and  septonodular enhancement confirm the
chondroid nature of the tumor. No cortical scalloping is present on
the axial T1W-image. ConclusionThe lesion is quite large for the
diagnosis enchondroma.
As mentioned before we use a cutoff
of 5 cm. There is wall-to-wall filling, but no scalloping. No aggressive
features are present (such as periosteal reaction, bone marrow oedema). It was diagnosed as ACT and follow up
was performed by wait-and-scan. After 5 years of follow up, the
craniocaudal diameter increased 6 mm. There were no other worrisome
features and the patient remained in follow up. CaseFirst look at the images.
What are the findings?
Then continue reading. Images X-rays:there is an area with chondroid
matrix calcifications and some osteolysis of less than 2 cm adjacent to the
closed physis in the distal femur. No relation with the cortex was seen.
MRI was done to assess the true size and decide whether the lesion needed follow-up. MRI: on the sagittal T1W-image the
lesion measures maximum 2.8 cm and there is a close relation to the posterior
cortex at the intercondylar notch. Conclusion Because of the extent to the posterior cortex,
the lesion was called ACT and remained in follow up.
Atypical Cartilaginous Tumor:
ACTs are intermediate grade chondroid tumors. 
They are often larger than
5 cm, extend up to the cortex and show cortical scalloping.
They may have
interspersed fatty marrow. 
On MR perfusion, fast enhancement (within 10
seconds) can be present. Keep in mind that growth itself does not imply malignant transformation,
and some of these lesions regress in size over time.
ACTs do not show
periostitis unless there is a fracture. 
No cortex destruction or soft tissue
mass is allowed for the diagnosis ACT. 
In that case we should call it a chondrosarcoma of higher
grade. This case was shown before. Looking back to the previous
MRI performed 5 years before, 6 mm growth occurred in the craniocaudal
dimension.     
Also note some expansion
of the lesion anteriorly  (yellow arrows).
No cortical thinning,
bone marrow oedema or periostitis are present. This lesion is an
ACT and remains in follow-up.
ACT versus high grade CS:
Differentiation between ACT and high grade CS is the most important task for a radiologist, as the high grade tumors need wide resection. Since the paradigm has shifted, more and more centers treat ACTs with watchful waiting and no operation. 
Actively look for features such as perilesional bone marrow oedema, periosteal reaction, cortical destruction and a soft tissue mass to call a tumor high grade CS. Bone expansion may be seen in ACT but is more common in high grade CS. 
Mucoid components are a sign of higher grade and are also present for example in dedifferentiated CS.
Fast dynamic contrast enhancement, cortical scalloping and matrix calcifications can be present in both ACTs and high grade CS so these features do not differentiate the two.
Size matters but is not a key feature to differentiate ACT from high grade CS.
In case of a pathological fracture in ACT, surrounding oedema and periostitis may be present. Always correlate the images with the clinical history of a trauma and recommend follow up MRI after 3-6 months to assure that these findings resolve. We will now show you some cases, where you have to differentiate between ACT and chondrosarcoma. CaseFirst look at the images and decide whether you are dealing with an ACT or CS.
Then continue reading. Images
There is a lesion measuring
more than 20 cm in the diaphysis of the femur.
Note the popcorn matrix
calcifications.
There
is one focal nodule (within the yellow circle) causing cortical scalloping and
there is mild extension of the marrow cavity. Continue with the MR... First look at the images.
Then continue reading. Images 
MR-images show interspersed fat between the cartilage nodules. 
It has a high signal on the sagittal T1W-image and low signal on the fat suppressed image (arrows).
There is one focal nodule causing cortical scalloping (<10%) and there is mild extension of the marrow cavity. ConclusionThe lesion was diagnosed as ACT and remained
stable during follow up. CaseFirst look at the images and decide whether you are dealing with an ACT or CS.
Then continue reading. Images 
There is a well defined
osteolytic lesion >10 cm in the proximal femur diaphysis with popcorn i.e.
chondroid matrix calcifications.    
There is expansion of the bone, however no frank cortical scalloping or periostitis. Conclusion
Based on the radiograph alone, this tumor could be an ACT or a chondrosarcoma of higher grade. The next step is to perform MRI for further characterization. Case
First look at the images.
Then continue reading. Images 
MRI confirms the chondroid nature of the tumor with hyperintense
cartilage nodules on T2 DIXON that show septonodular enhancement after
contrast. 
However, there is also marked bone marrow oedema proximally (black arrow) and a periosteal reaction with enhancement (white arrow). Conclusion
These features are very suspicious for the diagnosis of a high
grade chondrosarcoma. Images
Axial T1 weighted image confirms deep
anterior cortical scalloping over approximately 1/3 of the cortex, i.e. extensive scalloping ( > 10% of tumor circumference). A proximal femur resection
was performed.
Final diagnosis: chondrosarcoma grade II Case
First look at the images.
Then continue reading. Images 
Radiograph shows small areas of chondroid matrix mineralization. 
COR T2W FS illustrates how the size of the lesion is underestimated on plain film. 
Note the hyperintense cartilage nodules in combination with low SI areas in keeping with the calcifications on X ray. 
After contrast typical rings-and-arcs enhancement is seen. Conclusion
Due to the size  of 5.7 cm and the extent to the cortex, this was called an ACT and the lesion will be followed up with MRI. Case
First look at the images.
Then continue reading. Images 
The radiograph shows an expansile multilocular osteolytic lesion in the proximal radius metaphysis. 
Some small specs of calcification are visible within the lesion.
The tumor is hyperintense on T2 DIXON and there are areas of cortex destruction.
After contrast, typical septonodular enhancement is present and areas of mucoid without enhancement, also in the soft tissue component. 
Around the tumor we see soft tissue oedema. 
These findings help us to make the diagnosis of a high grade chondrosarcoma. Pathology after wide resection came back as grade II chondrosarcoma.
MRI follow-up guidance for ACT:
In our centre, ACTs are followed up by MRI as shown in the table [1].
This may provide some clinical guidance, however solid long term (>10 years follow up) data is needed to further define a good follow up interval and final duration, as MRI scans come with a burden of costs and may cause worry for the patient. If aggressive features occur during follow-up that are
worrisome for chondrosarcoma, the patient is discussed in the multidisciplinary
tumor board and surgical treatment may be considered.
Chondrosarcoma:
Chondrosarcomas are on average more than 10 cm
at presentation, show cortical destruction and often have an accompanying soft
tissue mass. 
However, smaller chondrosarcomas of high grade occur, therefore
size is not the best criterium. Periostitis on MRI is shown as a
T2 hyperintense rim surrounding the cortex, enhancing after contrast. 
A mucoid
component may be present within the marrow cavity or in the soft tissue mass. 
These
lesions are high grade meaning they are at risk to metastasize (primarily to
the lungs). Treatment is wide resection and in addition to
the MRI, a CT may be done for preoperative planning, as radical resection is
the only good treatment option. Case
First look at the images.
Then continue reading. Images 
There is an osteolytic, expansile
lesion in the right proximal femur diaphysis.
Adjacent subtle cortical
thickening is present without periosteal reaction.
No frank chondroid matrix is
appreciated on this radiograph. Conclusion
The differential diagnosis would include chondrosarcoma,
fibrous dysplasia, lymphoma, metastasis and plasmacytoma. An unenhanced CT could help in
detection of subtle chondroid matrix calcifications in this case. However, we
went straight for MRI.  
Continue with the MRI... First look at the images.
Then continue reading. Images 
T1W-image shows marrow replacement.
T2W-image shows periosteal reaction
and perilesional bone marrow edema. 
The tumor itself is hyperintense and
nodular.
T1W FS post Gd-image shows rings-and-arcs
enhancement pattern. Conclusion
All these findings are in keeping
with a chondroid tumor, and very suspicious of a chondrosarcoma of grade II or
higher. In our tertiary referral center for
bone sarcomas we perform no biopsy in these chondroid tumors, as this may cause
sampling error due to heterogeneity within the tumor.
You may erroneously biopsy the
friendlier part of the tumor and underestimate the grade. Chondroid tumors are known for their
seeding along the biopsy tract. Continue with the postoperative
X-rays..... Treatment consisted of en bloc resection of the proximal femur and reconstruction with an endoprosthesis. Pathology confirmed a chondrosarcoma grade II. Chondrosarcomas grade II and III cannot be differentiated based on imaging.
This is a diagnosis made on histopathology.
Therefore, we refer to such lesions as “grade II or higher” in our radiology report. CaseFirst look at the images.
Then continue reading. Images 
Radiographs demonstrate an
aggressive expansile osteolytic lesion in the proximal femur diaphysis of a 30-year-old patient.
There
is extensive cortical scalloping and a spiculated, hair-on-end periosteal
reaction.
Note the pathological fracture of the trochanter minor.
There is subtle mineralization in the soft
tissues medially (arrow). ConclusionAll these findings are pointing
towards a malignant bone tumor. 
In the differential diagnosis (taking
into account the age and diaphyseal location) we would include a Ewing sarcoma,
but also a high grade chondrosarcoma.
Although Langerhans cell
histiocytosis may also present in the diaphysis of a long bone in this age
group, this tumor is very large and the periosteal reaction is too
aggressive. Continue with the MRI… First look at the images.
Is this a chondroid tumor or something else?
What is the best
treatment, follow up or resection? ImagesMRI confirms the T2
hyperintense multinodular aspect of a chondroid tumor.
There is a large soft
tissue mass present anteromedially. There is marked periostitis on MRI, bone
marrow oedema proximally and surrounding oedema in the soft tissues.
Note the septonodular
enhancement pattern.
There is no enhancement
cranially in the tumor and in the soft tissue mass. This is regarded as a mucoid
component. Conclusion
Based on the MRI findings, we should make the diagnosis of a chondrosarcoma grade II or higher.
Treatment was wide resection. Pathology diagnosis: Chondrosarcoma grade III A mucoid component is one feature of a high grade chondrosarcoma, visible for both radiologist and pathologist.
The pathologist also assesses cellularity, nuclear atypia and mitoses in the tumor, which are higher than in ACT or grade I chondrosarcoma. CaseLet’s continue with a chondroid tumor in the axial skeleton. We have to shift gears as there is a different approach than for lesions in the appendicular skeleton.
First look at the images.
Then continue reading. Images 
Axial CT shows an expansile
osteolytic tumor in the corpus of the sternum.
There are multiple foci of cortical
destruction.
Popcorn calcifications are present centrally. 
MRI confirms the chondroid nature of
this tumor with hyperintense signal on the STIR-image and septonodular contrast
enhancement. ConclusionAlthough there is no soft
tissue component, due to the expansion and multiple foci of cortex destruction this tumor should be called a chondrosarcoma of grade II or higher and en bloc resection
is the correct treatment. Pathology showed a grade II
chondrosarcoma. In the axial skeleton chondroid tumors have a worse outcome.
This implies, that they are resected even if they are grade I as opposed to the same tumor in the appendicular skeleton, which is called an ACT and will receive follow up. 
Do not call axial tumors enchondromas if they show cortical scalloping or cortical destruction, as this would lead to undertreatment. CaseFirst look at the images.
Then continue reading. Images 
On the radiograph, there is a permeative osteolytic lesion with aggressive periosteal reaction, cortical scalloping and expansion. 
Axial T2 DIXON shows multiple soft tissue masses along the humerus. 
The post contrast sequence demonstrates septonodular enhancement, aggressive periostitis and mucoid areas within the tumor without enhancement both proximally in the medulla and in the soft tissue mass medially. Conclusion
High grade CS.
Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma:
First look at the images of a 79-year-old patient with a bone tumor.
Then continue reading. Images 
Radiographsshow a large tumor in the femoral diaphysis with typical popcorn calcifications distally and a
more osteolytic component proximally. Detailed magnified window of the
lateral view shows cortical permeation by the tumor and a high risk for a
pathological fracture. The caudal part of the tumor appears
like an ACT with focal cortical scalloping, while the cranial part looks like a high grade CS. ConclusionThis is the typical
presentation of a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, with one part behaving like a
low to intermediate grade cartilage tumor with abrupt transition to a
high-grade (sometimes non-cartilaginous) sarcomatous component. This subtype
usually presents in older adults.    
Overall survival of a dedifferentiated
chondrosarcoma is poor as compared to chondrosarcomas grade II and III, as
patients often present with pulmonary and bone metastases at the time of
diagnosis. Continue with the next images... ImagesNote the cortical defect on the axial
T2 DIXON and the surrounding soft tissue mass.
Part of the tumor does not enhance
and this area of mucoid indicates a high grade chondrosarcoma. As on the radiographs, this
case is a typical dedifferentiated
chondrosarcoma, where the lower part behaves
like an ACT and the proximal part as a high grade sarcoma.
Frequently they present as a large tumor in an elderly patient. Perfusion images demonstrate
heterogeneous enhancement within this dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. 
The mucoid part (blue line)
shows no enhancement. Continue with the PET-CT... We discussed before that 18F-FDG PET-CT is not recommended for
chondrosarcoma to differentiate between ACT and high grade tumors. However, in dedifferentiated
chondrosarcoma, PET CT combined with a diagnostic CT of the chest may be
performed to look for metastatic disease. The dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma in
the right femur shows high FDG captation and the whole body image demonstrates multiple bone metastases in the left femur, left clavicle, cranial ribs on the
right and in the sternum. Para-iliac lymph node metastases are
present bilaterally. As chondrosarcomas are insensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the
patient received palliative care, including nailing of the right femur to
prevent a fracture. Unfortunately, he developed a pathological fracture in the left femur
which was subsequently treated. Coronal CT image of the chest demonstrates the soft tissue mass around
a metastasis in the left clavicle. 
No pulmonary metastases were found. The prognosis of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma is poor with a 5-year
overall survival of about 18%.
Osteochondromas:
Osteochondromas
are peripheral chondroid tumors, meaning they are not located in the medullary
cavity. 
Two morphological subtypes exist: sessile (broad based) or pedunculated
lesions (with a stalk) covered by a cartilage cap. The
stalk of an osteochondroma is continuous with the marrow cavity, originates
from the metaphysis and points away from the joint.
The cartilage
cap thickness should be less than 2 cm in patients with closed physes according
to the WHO criteria defined in 2020.
If the cap measures more than 2 cm, this
is worrisome for ACT or even chondrosarcoma, and these lesions are resected. In
children, the cartilage cap of an osteochondroma may be thicker than 2 cm as
their skeleton is still developing. This radiograph is of a 17-year-old patient
presenting with pain in the shoulder since 2
months. Image
There is a pedunculated lesion originating from the proximal
humerus metaphysis. 
The stalk shows continuity of the bone marrow and an
overlying cap containing chondroid matrix calcifications. 
These findings are typical for an
osteochondroma. On the radiograph, the mineralized
and thereby visible part of the cartilage cap is large, which is why a MRI was
performed to adequately measure the thickness of the cap. Continue with the MR-images... The thickness of the cartilage cap is measured perpendicular to the cortex on a T2 weighted sequence. ImageAxial T2W-image with fatsat
shows the osteochondroma on the posterior aspect of the left proximal humerus
with a cartilage cap thickness of 22 mm. In lesions
with a cartilage cap > 2 cm, resection is performed to exclude a
chondrosarcoma. The tumor was removed and
pathology was in keeping with a peripheral ACT. Image
Radiographs show an expansile lesion
with cartilage matrix mineralization originating from the right femur at the
level of the lesser trochanter. 
The cartilage cap seems well demarcated and
matured. MRI was performed to assess the cartilage
thickness of the cap. Continue with the MRI... T2W-image with fat saturation demonstrates a thin overlying
cartilage cap of only 3 millimeters. 
The rest of the lesion is matured, which means that it contains bone marrow with suppressed signal on the fat saturated sequence Continue with the CT.... In addition, see the complete bony maturation
of the cartilage cap on the unenhanced CT. 
The rim of the lesion is well defined. This lesion was called an
osteochondroma as there are no signs of malignancy, it is not suspicious of ACT
or chondrosarcoma. Sometimes these osteochondromas are
resected due to mechanical complaints or after a fracture, and they may give
rise to an overlying bursa.
Differential diagnosis of Chondroid tumors:
The
differential diagnosis of chondroid tumors depends on the age, location and whether
there are single or multiple lesions.
Several examples of differential diagnoses are given in the table. Bone infarctions and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia are  “do not touch lesions”.
This means that these lesions have such a typical appearance that they can be characterized based on radiographs alone without the need for a biopsy. 
However if there is only a single lesion and the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia is uncertain, CT guided biopsy may be performed. In case of highly aggressive tumors, other primary bone tumors such as Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma may enter the differential diagnosis.
Especially the rare subtype osteolytic osteosarcoma or chondroblastic osteosarcoma can be difficult to distinguish from chondroid tumors. 
In case of doubt, a biopsy for pathology diagnosis needs to be obtained, as there are important consequences for treatment (such as chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients). 
In patients over 50 years of age, the differential diagnosis includes metastasis and plasmacytoma. Bone infarctions Bone infarction
The most common differential diagnosis for matrix mineralization in the metaphysis of a long bone is a bone infarction. These calcifications appear more squared than rounded such as in cartilage tumors.
In addition, bone infarctions are often multifocal and may occur bilaterally. ImageRadiograph demonstrates multiple serpiginous sclerotic lesions in the distal femur and proximal tibia, centered on the metaphysis.
This image is typical for bone infarctions and occurred due to longstanding steroid use in a patient with SLE.
Note the absence of stippled chondroid calcifications. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia Fibrous dysplasia
In the differential diagnosis we can consider fibrous dysplasia, which often contains a cartilage component.
In most cases the ground glass appearance on radiographs helps to differentiate. First look at the images of a 23-year-old male with a history of pubertas praecox (early puberty). Then continue reading. HipThere is expansion of the proximal femur with widening of the metaphysis and a ground glass osteolytic lesion with sclerotic margins in the medullary cavity. Note the secondary osteoarthritis of the hip.
WristThe distal radius shows the same appearance with a changed bone structure due to ground glass osteolytic lesions with expansion. Also the first and second metacarpals are affected. Conclusion
The multiple bone involvement together with the age, history of pubertas praecox and the radiographical appearance make this pathognomonic for FD. 
No biopsy should be done. This patient is known with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia as a part of the McCune Albright syndrome. Fibrous dysplasia Images
Radiograph of the right humerus in a 26 year old patient shows a large lesion filling the medullary cavity of the proximal humerus metaphysis and diaphysis, with osteolytic and groundglass appearance and more sclerotic components distally. 
There are no periosteal reaction or other aggressive features. 
Given the age and this appearance, FD would be a likely diagnosis. 
MRI was performed for further characterisation in this case. Coronal T1 and STIR images demonstrate cystic components within the lesion, which are hypo-intense on T1W and hyperintense on STIR (arrows). These are typical for FD. 
In between the cystic areas there is fat, which is hyperintense on T1W and signal is suppressed on STIR (asterix). 
Note the distal part of the lesion contains very low signal intensity corresponding to the sclerosis on X-ray. FD can appear heterogeneous and contain cartilage components adjacent to cystic areas or sclerosis. 
No biopsy is needed as these findings are in keeping with mono-ostotic FD. Langerhans cell histiocytosis Langerhans cell histiocytosis
In the ribs Langerhans cell histiocytosis may mimic a chondroid tumor. Images ConclusionThe differential diagnosis includes a cartilage tumor (CS-I because ribs are part of the axial skeleton), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (typical location, young patient), and in patients over 50 years think of multiple myeloma (typical location).
A biopsy was performed under CT guidance and LCH was the final diagnosis. 
The lesion was followed up and resolved without treatment. In case of highly aggressive tumors (high grade CS), other primary bone tumors such as Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma may enter the differential diagnosis. 
Especially in the more rare osteolytic osteosarcoma cases this can be difficult to distinguish from chondroid tumors. 
In patients over 50 years of age, a metastasis can be a mimicker of a chondroid tumor.
WHO classification of chondroid tumors:
In the 2013 WHO classiﬁcation,
the term atypical cartilaginous tumor (ACT) was introduced as a synonym for
chondrosarcoma grade 1 (CS1) and classiﬁed as intermediate (locally
aggressive) to reﬂect
the clinical behavior of these well-differentiated low-grade lesions. The argument was that such lesions,
especially in the long bones, behave in a locally aggressive manner and do not
metastasize. Therefore, they should not be classiﬁed as having full malignant potential
(1). In the 2020 WHO edition the term ACT
is only reserved for low-grade chondrosarcomas located within the long bones of
the appendicular skeleton. The term “CS1”should be reserved for tumors of the
axial skeleton, including the pelvis, ribs, scapula and skull base (ﬂat
bones), reﬂecting
the poorer clinical outcome of these tumors at these sites. Primary central ACTs arise in the medulla of long bones without a benign
precursor.
Secondary central ACTs arise centrally in bone in association with a
preexisting enchondroma.
Peripheral ACTs in long bones arise secondary within the cartilaginous
cap of a preexisting osteochondroma.
The WHO 2020 defined a cut-off of 2 cm
for the cartilage cap thickness. Other changes in the 2020 WHO classification
are:

Staging and Treatment of Breast Cancer:
Robin Smithuis, Janneke de Bes and Anneke Zeillemaker
Department of Radiology and Surgery of the Alrijne hospital, Leiderdorp in the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2016-08-29 Imaging plays a major role in the detection and staging of breast cancer and monitoring treatment. In this era of rapidly changing management of breast cancer, it is important to be familiar with the staging classification and be aware of the available surgical, radiotherapeutic and oncological management options in order to provide relevant information and so optimize patient care This article is an overview of breast cancer staging and treatment. Keep in mind there are local differences in treatment strategies, and that new targeted therapies are currently being developed.

Staging and treatment overview 1:
This is a schematic illustration of the staging and treatment in a patient with breast cancer. This results in a pTNM-stage. After neoadjuvant therapy the letter y is added, and it is referred to as the ypTNMstage.

Staging and treatment overview 2:
This table demonstrates the staging and treatment of breastcancer in a more schematic way. cTNM Breast cancer is first clinically staged. The cTNM describes the local involvement of the breast (T), regional lymph nodes (N) and systemic disease, i.e. distant metastases (M). Systemic disease (or stage 4 disease) is not included in the table. This results in the possible diagnoses of DCIS, localized cancer, locoregionally advanced cancer and cancer with distant metastases. The term 'clinical' in clinical TNM-stage may be somewhat confusing. One might think that this staging is largely based on the findings of physical examination, but it is mostly based on the results of imaging and image-guided biopsy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (from neo: before and adjuvare: to aid) is given to patients with locoregionally advanced cancer to decrease the tumor burden prior to surgery. In patients with localized cancer in whom there is an indication for adjuvant therapy (see table under adjuvant therapy), the therapy may be given before surgery (neo-adjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant). Sentinel Node In patients who have no detectable axillary lymph node metastases with ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA), a sentinel node procedure is performed in order to acquire information about the lymph node status of the axilla. Breast Conserving Therapy or Mastectomy BCT is performed when excision is possible with good cosmetic result. Surgery is always followed by radiotherapy. Good cosmetic result depends on the size of the tumor and the size of the breast. Nowadays it is possible to treat larger tumors with BCT by applying plastic- and reconstructive surgery with fat grafting and flap-procedures. If BCT is not possible - or wanted by the patient - a mastectomy is performed. Radiotherapy Treatment is planned on the final stage and tumor characteristics. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are complementary treatment options after primary locoregional treatment. These are aimed at eliminating any distant occult metastases which may be present, but cannot be detected yet. Adjuvant therapy can consist of chemotherapy and/or herceptin and/or hormonal therapy. The choice of therapy depends on:
DCIS:
There are multiple fine, linear calcifications in a large segment of the breast. These are suspicious calcifications and are typically seen in DCIS. Click to enlarge Ductal carcinoma in situ is the most common non-invasive breast cancer. In situ means 'in place' and refers to the fact that the cancer has not moved out of the duct and does not infiltrate the surrounding tissue. DCIS can progress to become invasive cancer, but likelihood estimates vary. 80% of DCIS is diagnosed on mammography alone on the basis of microcalcifications (figure), followed by vacuum-assisted biopsy. Very few cases of DCIS present as a palpable mass. The problem with DCIS is: Because of these problems, a pre-operative MRI is performed in cases with high-grade DCIS in some institutions, to better delineate the spread of the tumor and to assess if there are any signs of invasive growth. Whether this is of benefit to the patient is still unclear. Treatment of DCIS consists of breast conserving therapy (BCT) or mastectomy depending on whether excision is possible with good cosmetic result, and of course, on patient preference. BCT consists of microscopically complete tumor excision and radiotherapy. A radiation boost may be considered, particularly in younger patients. Sentinel node procedure should be considered in patients likely to have additional invasive carcinoma (see table). SpecimenIf the DCIS is completely resected, this is called an R0-resection. After breast conserving surgery, these patients are treated with radiotherapy. If there is focal invasion of the resection margins, an extra boost is given. If there is more than focal invasion (> 4mm) then a re-resection or mastectomy will be performed. Click to enlarge Study the images and then continue reading. Click image to enlarge. The findings are: Because of the large area with calcifications, a mastectomy was planned. A sentinel node procedure was also performed because of the estimated size of the DCIS. Whenever a mastectomy is planned, an SN-procedure is routinely included, because it cannot be performed afterwards. Pathology showed small foci of invasive cancer. Click to enlarge In this patient, there are two groups of suspicious calcifications which are about 5 cm apart. First the larger group was biopsied. The idea was that if these calcifications were benign, then the smaller cluster would probably also be benign. However, the larger group of calcifications turned out to be DCIS grade 2. So a second biopsy was needed of the smaller group of calcifications, and this also turned out to be DCIS grade 2. A mastectomy with a sentinel node procedure was planned. The total area of DCIS was thought to be too large for breast conserving treatment.
Localized breast cancer:
Localized or early stage breast cancer includes: Axilla The axilla is initially examined with ultrasound. When pathologic lymph nodes are detected, the next step is FNA. If the results are positive (N+), usually a PET-CT is performed to exclude more advanced disease. When no suspicious lymph nodes are found with ultrasound (N), the next step is a sentinel node procedure. BCT in Localized breast cancer When breast conserving surgery is performed, there is always a risk of leaving small areas of tumor behind - even when the resection margins are tumor-free. This is the main reason why in BCT, surgery is always combined with radiotherapy. The risk of local recurrence is greater in tumors surrounded by an extensive DCIS component. Depending on the receptor status of the tumor, most patients with localized cancer will also receive adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. Only older patients (>70y) or patients younger than 70 years with small, low-grade tumors do not need chemotherapy (see table). No further investigations are necessary in localized breast cancer, because the chance of finding metastatic disease is very low.
Locoregional advanced cancer:
Locally advanced breast cancer includes: Treatment In the past these tumors were synonymous with inoperable breast cancer, but this has changed after the introduction of neoadjuvant therapy. These patients are first treated with neoadjuvant chemo- and/or hormonal therapy. If there is a good response to the neoadjuvant therapy, the next step is surgery and sometimes even breast-conserving surgery is possible. Before neoadjuvant therapy is given, a clip is placed in the tumor. Sometimes the response is so good that no residual tumor can be found. There is current debate whether these patients still need surgery, but currently, most of these patients are treated with BCT (lumpectomy centered on the clip, followed by radiotherapy ).
Surgery and other procedures:
FNA of axillary lymph nodesThe criteria for performing Ultrasound guided FNA or biopsy of an axillary lymph node are:
Wire localisation:
DCIS and many small tumors are not palpable. In these cases, the radiologist places a hook wire in the area that needs to be removed. The wire is placed within the tumor or the area of DCIS, either US-guided or stereotactically. With US, the position of the tumor is marked on the skin, while the patient holds her arm in the same position as during surgery. The exact depth of the tumor beneath the skin is also noted. The figure shows the tract of the wire (yellow arrows) towards the tumor (red arrow). Notice the black dot on the skin to mark the exact position of the tumor. The curved arrow indicates the entrance of the wire into the breast.
Sentinel node:
The sentinel node procedure (SLN) has become the standard method for staging the axilla in breast cancer patients with a negative axillary ultrasound (cN-). SLN biopsy provides accurate staging information while avoiding the morbidity of a complete axillary lymph node dissection. A radiopharmacon together with a dye is injected in or near the tumor (figure). These tracers flow through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node(s) to receive the tracers are removed. Usually about three nodes are removed. Removal of more than three SLNs does not increase the accuracy of finding a positive node.
BCT:
Breast Conserving Treatment (BCT) is also known as lumpectomy or wide excision. A locoregional excision of the tumor is combined with a sentinel node procedure for axillary node staging, followed by radiotherapy of the breast with or without a boost. MRI-compatible clips should be placed in the tumor bed for the purpose of obtaining accuracy in radiotherapy. Re-excision is indicated if there is more than a focal tumor-positive resection margin (see pathology). Resection margins in BCT No tumor in the resection margin.
* Focal non-radical Less than 4mm of the resection margin contains tumor.
* More than focal More than 4mm of the margin is involved. Invasive cancerRe-excision is indicated if there is a more than focal tumor-positive resection margin, as this is the most important risk factor for local recurrence. When the resection margin is only focally involved, adjusting the radiation dose appears to be a good alternative to re-excision. DCISTreatment is more aggressive in DCIS, since re-excision or mastectomy is advocated in any involvement of the resection margins.
Mastectomy:
Simple MastectomyRemoval of the whole breast. Some of the axillary lymph nodes (level I) may also be removed. Modified radical mastectomyThe breast, most or all of the axillary lymph nodes, and the fascia of the chest wall muscles is removed. The pectoralis muscle is not removed. Nipple sparing mastectomy In most cases the nipple is removed in a mastectomy. The nipple can be spared if: DIEP flap
Oncoplastic surgery:
Direct reconstructionDirect breast reconstruction using implants. DIEP-flapThe deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap is a common technique in which skin and subcutaneous fat are taken from the abdomen to recreate the breast. SGAP flapThe superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) flap uses tissue from the top of the buttocks to create breast tissue. This is usually done if patients do not have adequate skin and tissue in their abdomens or have had previous abdominal surgeries. TRAM flap In a pedicle TRAM flap, the tissue remains attached to its original site, retaining its blood supply. The flap, consisting of the skin, fat, and muscle with its blood supply, is tunneled beneath the skin to the chest.
Axillary Lymph Node Dissection:
In Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) the axillary lymph nodes are removed. There are three levels of axillary lymph nodes: Level I is below the lower edge of the pectoralis minor muscle. Level II is at the level of the pectoralis minor. Level III is above the pectoralis minor. In ALND levels I and II are removed. Nowadays, surgeons try to avoid an ALND by performing a sentinel node dissection or by downstaging the axilla with neoadjuvant therapy. ALND is performed when there are many positive nodes or when neoadjuvant therapy is not possible. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
MARI procedure:
The MARI procedure is a new minimal invasive method to assess the pathological response of an axillary lymph node metastasis after neoadjuvant systemic treatment. The tumor-positive axillary lymph node is marked with a radioactive iodine (I) seed. This marked lymph node is the so-called MARI-node. After neoadjuvant treatment, the MARI node is selectively removed using a γ-detection probe. If the node has become tumor-negative and the sentinel node is also negative, no additional treatment of the axilla is necessary. This method allows axilla-conserving surgery in patients who respond well to neoadjuvant treatment.
Pathology:

pTNM-stage:
Following surgery, the surgical specimens of the tumor, the sentinel node or axillary nodes after dissection are analyzed by the pathologist. This results in a pTNM-stage (table). The pTNM may differ from the cTNM-stage, and sometimes the original treatment plan has to be adjusted. For example, if the margins of a resected specimen are not tumor-free, re-excision or adjustment of radiotherapy may be necessary. For a proper pathological pT-classification there can be no gross tumor in the resection margins. Classification is possible with microscopic tumor in the margins. The tumor size includes only the invasive component. If there is a large in situ component (e.g. 4 cm) and a small invasive component (e.g. 0,5 cm), the tumor is measured 0,5 cm and coded pT1a. The analysis of the surgical specimen of the tumor, the sentinel node or axillary nodes after dissection by the pathologist results in a pTNM or ypTNM-stage. Other tumor characteristics such as tumor-grade, hormone receptors, lymphangio-invasion and gene-expression are also examined, as these characteristics also determine the risk of local recurrence and systemic disease.
pN-stage:
ypN-stage In patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the lymph node status will be affected. For this reason, a y is added to the pN-stage. For instance, if a sentinel node procedure is performed after neoadjuvant therapy and 3 positive nodes are found at pathology, this will result in a ypN1a. Tumor-grading The histological grade of a tumor is another important prognostic factor in the staging of a tumor. A high-grade tumor is more likely to spread, necessitating more aggressive adjuvant therapy. Tumor grading is done according to the modified Bloom and Richardson guidelines and is based on the total score of tubule formation, nuclear polymorphism and mitotic activity.
Gene expression:
The prognosis and treatment of patients with breast cancer depends on many factors: Analysis of the DNA of the tumor and the gene expression has led to the identification of subtypes of breast cancer that have distinct clinical outcomes and different responses to chemotherapy. It can help to select patients that need to be treated aggressively and who don't. Gene expression is a process in which a gene gets turned on in a cell to make RNA and proteins. Some of these proteins, such as HER2/neu, stimulate the growth of tumor cells. HER2/neu This protein is produced in abnormally high amounts in about 20% of breast tumors. Breast cancers that overproduce HER2 tend to be more aggressive and are more likely to recur. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) targets the HER2 protein specifically, and in conjunction with adjuvant chemotherapy, can lower the risk of recurrence by about 50% when compared with chemotherapy alone. Whenever breast cancer recurs or spreads, the cancer cells should be retested for HER2 as well as for hormone receptor status, as these may differ from the original cancer in up to 20 to 30 percent of cases (8). Mammaprint On the basis of patterns of gene expression, breast cancer may be subdivided into different molecular subtypes or profiles. One of these profiles is the MammaPrint®, which tests for 70 different tumor genes and divides patients into a high- and low-risk category and whether patients will benefit from chemotherapy or not.
Systemic Therapy:
* Some advocate chemotherapy in all HER2+ patients younger than 35 years
Adjuvant systemic therapy:
Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are administered as complements to primary locoregional treatment with the aim of eliminating any distant occult metastases (which may be present, but cannot be detected yet). Adjuvant therapy can consist of chemotherapy, herceptin and/or hormonal therapy. Herceptin as added to chemotherapy in patients who are HER2/neu positive and hormonal therapy is given to patients who have estrogen or progesteron receptors (ER+ or PR+) In older women who are ER+ or PR+ sometimes only hormonal therapy ois given in trying to stabalize the disease.
Neoadjuvant therapy:
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or primary systemic treatment used to be given exclusively to patients with locally advanced disease, i.e. stage III and stage II-patients with a large tumor (T3N0). Current policy is that more and more patients with early cancer, who have an indication for chemotherapy, are also being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead of adjuvant therapy post-surgery. Advantages of this policy is that neoadjuvant therapy allows for monitoring of the response to treatment, so that the type of chemotherapy can be adjusted when there is no adequate response. Another advantage is that the size of the lumpectomy can be reduced, and breast conserving treatment may be possible in patients who would otherwise have been treated with mastectomy. Even in clinical complete remission, a combination of surgery and radiotherapy was found necessary to avoid local recurrence. Preconditions for starting neoadjuvant therapy Breast diagnostics Regional diagnostics Screening for distant metastasis
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy:
The response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is 80-90%. The risk of progression is less than 5-10%. There is no clear treatment plan in case of progression, which is defined as RECIST > 20% increase in diameter during chemotherapy.
Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy:
There are no randomized studies available comparing neoadjuvant hormonal therapy with the same treatment postoperatively. Similar to chemotherapy, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy appears to make downstaging possible for hormone receptor-positive tumors, with an improved chance of radical surgery in stage III or BCT when mastectomy initially seemed necessary.
Neoadjuvant trastuzumab:
The addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases the percentage of pathological complete response.
Radiotherapy:
Radiotherapy of the breast Radiotherapy forms an integral part of breast conserving treatment in breast cancer. Most recurrences after BCT are due to growth of residual tumor. The whole breast is irradiated with an optional boost dose to the tumor bed. Patients with a small and low grade DCIS have a low risk of recurrence and additional radiotherapy may not be justified (15). Radiotherapy of the chest wall Indications for radiotherapy of the chest wall following mastectomy are: Radiotherapy of the axilla Axillary radiotherapy is a safe alternative to axillary lymph node surgery and has a less risk of lymphedema. There is a lot of discussion concerning the indications for radiotherapy of the axilla. Many guidelines are not evidence-based. Approaches differ between countries and between institutions. In the Duthc Breast Cancer Guideline 2012 the indications are as follows (1): Radiotherapy is not recommended.
2. Micrometastases in the SN: Radiotherapy is only recommended in case of additional risk factors.
3. Macrometastases: Radiotherapy is indicated. In cases with a large axillary tumor load an axillary lymph node dissection is recommended. These guidelines however do not apply to other countries and are also not evidence-based, but expert opinions. You must reach a consensus for radiotherapy indications in your own institution.
Special types of breast cancer:

Triple negative breast cancer:
Approximately 15-20% of breast cancers are so-called triple negative and characterized by the absence of ER-, PR- and HER2-overexpression. These tumors occur more often at a young age, are high-grade, and on presentation often substantial in size with metastases to the axillary lymph nodes. Triple negative tumors have a poorer prognosis with rapid recurrences, and frequent brain metastases. Studies have found that these tumors respond better to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines and taxanes compared to other tumor types.
Inflammatory carcinoma:
Inflammatory carcinoma or mastitis carcinomatosa is a separate category of breast cancer and accounts for 1-5% of all breast cancers. It is characterized by diffuse redness, peau d'orange and swelling of the breast, therefore it is mainly a clinical diagnosis. It is a rare and very aggressive disease in which tumor emboli block the lymphatics in the skin. The TNM classification is T4D (stage III). Dimpling of the skin and nipple retraction is not the same as inflammatory breast cancer and may occur in any T-stage without affecting the classification.
Paget disease of the nipple:
The diagnosis of Paget disease of the nipple can only be made if there is no disease in the underlying breast parenchyma. Carcinomas in the breast parenchyma associated with Paget disease are categorized based on the size and characteristics of the parenchymal disease, although the presence of Paget disease should still be noted.
Lobular carcinoma:
Invasive lobular carcinoma is the second most common type of breast cancer after invasive ductal carcinoma (17). Invasive lobular carcinomas tend to be more difficult to detect on mammography, because instead of forming a lump, the cancer cells typically spread to the surrounding connective tissue in a line formation.
Additional Imaging:

PET-CT:
When to use PET-CT PET-CT is recommended in patients with locoregional disease to search for distant metastases. PET-CT has a higher sensitivity and specificity for the detection of distant metastases and locoregional recurrence than conventional imaging. The sensitivity of PET-CT however is too low for the detection of a primary breast cancer and PET-CT also does not play a role in staging of a clinically negative axilla and cannot replace the SN-procedure. However, when axillary lymph node metastases are detected by FNA or sentinel node procedure, and the PET-CT shows uptake in lymph nodes, then all these nodes are regarded as positive, because the positive predictive value is high. Here an example of a patient with advanced breast cancer. The US of the breast showed an 18mm echopoor lesion with irregular margins and microcalcifications. US of the axilla revealed a lymph node with no fatty hilum. FNA was performed, and both the tumor and the lymph node were positive for adenocarcinoma. The lesion was clinically staged as cT1N+. A PET-CT was performed. On the upper PET-CT image a level II node is positive just underneath the pectoralis minor (yellow arrow). Multiple axillary nodes were found but no systemic metastases. Normal brown fat is seen along the neck and shoulder muscles on both sides (circle). This patient was planned for neoadjuvant therapy and biopsies were taken for the determination of the tumor grade, hormone receptors and HER-2-neu-amplification. Here another PET-CT example. On the mammogram, there is a tumor with secondary skin retraction. Notice multiple linear calcifications within the tumor - click on image to enlarge. This means that the infiltrating tumor developed within an area of ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS. Ultrasound demonstrates tumorfoci within the skin, i.e. T4b (red arrow). Continue... On this ultrasound image, there is another satellite nodule within the skin (yellow arrow). Multiple enlarged axillary nodes are seen (red arrow). Fine needle aspiration demonstrated metastases within these nodes. This tumor was staged as T4bN+. This means that we are dealing with locoregionally advanced disease. These patients are at risk for systemic disease and additional imaging was performed. Continue... Here we see the PET-CT image of this patient. Both the breast carcinoma as well as the spread to the skin are demonstrated (red arrows). There are multiple metastases in both lungs - a metastasis in the right lung is indicated by yellow arrow; notice the larger metastasis in the left lung. In addition, there were also bone- and liver metastases and multiple axillary lymph nodes were seen (not shown on this image). The cTNM-stage of the tumor is T4bN3M1.
MRI:
MRI is found to be better at indicating the size of DCIS and invasive cancer and is also better in detecting multifocal or contralateral disease. There is still debate concerning the role of preoperative MRI in patients with breast cancer, because overestimation occurs due to the presence of enhancing benign proliferative disorders. Many do not recommend a preoperative MRI, since it has not resulted in a better outcome or significantly lower percentage of reoperations. It is only recommended in high grade DCIS with indeterminate tumor size in patients who would like to be eligible for BCT. MRI however plays an important role in diagnostic problem solving and in the screening of high-risk patients. A large tumor in the right breast is easily detected with BSGI, while hardly visible on the mammogram.
BSGI:
Breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) is an adjunct modality for breast imaging which, like MRI, uses a physiologic approach to identify lesions in the breast. The sensitivity and specificity are comparable to MRI, and are much higher than for mammography - especially in dense breast tissue. The higher radiation dose compared to mammography makes BSGI unsuitable for screening, but it is an excellent tool for problem-solving. Just like MRI, it is good at detecting multifocal or contralateral disease. by Sharon H. Giordano The Oncologist December 2003 vol. 8no. 6 521-530

Transvaginal Ultrasound for Non-Gynaecological Conditions:

including Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis:
Julien Puylaert
Amsterdam UMC and Haaglanden MC, The Hague:
This is an overview of the use of Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS) for the diagnosis of various non-gynaecological
conditions as they appear in the pelvic cavity. This pictorial essay is for gynaecologists who want to
look beyond pathology of uterus and ovaries, and diagnose non-gynaecological
conditions. Also included here is Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE). Although
the latter is obviously a gynaecological disorder, its diagnosis requires thorough
knowledge of TVUS aspect of colon, ileum and bladder. This pictorial essay  is also for radiologists who like to master
the TVUS technique as an adjunct for their transabdominal US examination, diagnosing
both gynaecological and non-gynaecological conditions.  
See also ‘US of acute gynaecological conditions' For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com
Introduction:
Pelvic anatomy TVUS is traditionally performed by gynaecologists and obstetric
sonographers and their scope is generally focussed on the uterus, ovaries and Fallopian
tubes. However, there are more organs within the female pelvis
in reach of the transvaginal probe such as the bladder, urethra, distal ureters, sigmoid,
anorectum and the appendix. 
Also the virtual spaces of the peritoneal cavity as
cavum Retzii and Douglas pouch can be inspected. Due to the high mobility of
the vaginal top, pathology of these organs and regions can be studied by TVUS
with a high frequency probe, resulting in exceptionally detailed images. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Normal US anatomy Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Normal US anatomy Uterus and ovaries are best visualized with a half-full
bladder. A very full bladder is unpleasant for the patient, hinders adequate compression and pushes organs
away from the ventral abdominal wall, out of reach for transabdominal US. In the sagittal view, uterus, cervix, vagina, anorectum
and urethra (u.) can be identified, as well as the collapsed anterior and
posterior fornix of the vagina. Studying  the
uterus in retroflexion, usually requires more bladder filling. Normal US anatomy Sagittal view of the normal uterus with some intravaginal

the uterus. 
A little fluid in Douglas’ pouch and a small Nabothian cyst (n.) may
be easy to identify, but what are the structures marked with a question mark? Note
the full bladder displacing the uterus posteriorly.. Probe orientation in TVUS It is important to realize that the orientation of the
endovaginal probe is different from that of the abdominal probe. The right
panel shows the anteflexed uterus visualized with the endovaginal probe in the
anterior fornix of the vagina. This position of the uterus corresponds with the
image during transabdominal US. Probe orientation in TVUS Most sonographers, however,  look at the TVUS image rotated 90  degrees anti-clockwise, as in the right
panel. This is not necessarily a problem, as long as one realizes the different
presentation of the anatomy, including gravity effects. Note the horizon in
relation to the TVUS image. Fluid-debris-level in endometriotic cyst For instance, in this patient with an endometriotic cyst
the fluid-debris-level is vertically oriented, and could therefore be misinterpreted. This could be overcome by clockwise rotating the US image 90 degrees (right
image). The importance of orientation in pattern recognition. However, liberal switching of US image orientation does
not favour good pattern recognition. For this reason, it is best to stick to one
and the same orientation. For example, many radiologists reading a CT
colonography, made with the patient in prone position, will switch to the familiar
CT image in “supine” position, especially when searching for extra-colonic
pathology. Likewise,  although the image information of the two Mr.
Bean portraits is identical, the comedian is much easier recognized on the
picture hanging normal than on the one hanging upside-down.

Ureteral stones:
In pregnant patients with suspected ureterolithiasis, CT  is contra-indicated. If distal ureteric stones cannot be visualized with transabdominal US, TVUS may be of help. In this woman, the normal distal ureter (arrowheads) was visualized including a ureteric “jet-phenomenon” using Doppler. Note the small distance between vaginal probe and distal ureter. TVUS shows distal ureteric stone in pregnant patient with acute LLQ pain. US confirmed an intact pregnancy and showed a left-sided hydronephrosis.
The bladder was empty and no obstructing stone could be visualized. Additional TVUS demonstrated a distal stone (arrow) in the left ureter. Secondary thickening of the distal ureteric wall after stone passage. A 58 year old woman had a left sided colicky attack, followed by a burning sensation during micturition as well as macroscopic haematuria. She lost some blood clots in the urine, but did not notice any stones. CT showed no stones. The sediment showed atypical urothelial cells. TVUS showed  irregular wall thickening of the distal right ureter (arrowheads). The combination of these findings, raised the possibility of urothelial malignancy. Seven days later, she was symptom free without any treatment, the urine sediment was normal again and follow up TVUS showed complete normalization of the distal ureter (arrowheads). The final diagnosis was unnoticed stone passage with confusing secondary effects of  transient ureteric wall thickening and of abnormal urothelial cells in the sediment. Enable Scroll

apparently did evacuate to the sigmoid lumen. Paracolic diverticular abscess detected with TVUS A 37-year old woman, clinically suspected of a tubo-ovarian abscess, underwent TVUS. The gynaecologist consulted the radiologist, who recognized it as small paracolic abscess, probably of diverticular origin. Subsequently proven by  CT scan (S. = sigmoid). TVUS detects small sigmoid CA in patient with massive colonic obstruction. A 66-year old woman presented with progressive bloating
and constipation. CT showed massive colonic dilatation, but pelvic CT (not
shown here) was of low quality due to two hip prostheses. US confirmed multiple, strongly dilated, air-filled
large bowel loops, but was otherwise non-diagnostic. TVUS demonstrated a small, stenosing sigmoid carcinoma
with concomitant desmoid reaction (*) in the surrounding fat. Adenomatous polyp in the sigmoid, detected by TVUS.
Adenomatous polyp:
A colonic polyp (arrow) was seen both on CT and at
colonoscopy, however due to adhesion-related kinking, the polyp was out of
reach for biopsy.
Surgeons wanted more proof before proceeding to laparoscopic

Disable Scroll Rectal cancer in longstanding ulcerative colitis, detected by TVUS.
Rectal cancer:
A 39-year old woman with known ulcerative colitis for 20
years, presents with blood in the stool. TVUS confirms thickening of the hyperechoic submucosa
(arrowheads) compatible with longstanding inactive colitis. Also a hypoechoic carcinoma (CA) in the ventral rectal
wall is detected. Note the focal obliteration of the layer structure and the
desmoplastic reaction at the serosal side (*). Early acute appendicitis in pregnant patient, shown by TVUS.
Appendicitis:
A young, early pregnant woman presented with acute deep
pelvic pain. US demonstrated enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (ln) and
an intact intra-uterine pregnancy.
The appendix was not visualized. (ivc =
inferior vena cava, a = iliac artery). TVUS easily demonstrated a 12-mm, inflamed appendix harbouring
a large fecolith (arrowhead).
The appendix was in pelvic position and surrounded
by free fluid.  
There was no perforation
at surgery. TVUS detects inflamed appendix in deep pelvic location. In this obese, 3 weeks pregnant woman, transabdominal US
visualized an dubiously abnormal appendix (← ?). TVUS showed a dilated, pus filled, inflamed appendix
in deep pelvic location. Abscess in Crohn’s disease.
Crohn’s disease:
A young, 4 weeks pregnant woman presented with 6 days of
RLQ pain and a CRP of 120. US demonstrated wall thickening of the terminal ileum
with echolucent changes in the submucosa, suspect for Crohn’s disease. Complementary TVUS detected an abscess (a.) walled-off
by mesenterial and omental fat (*). Spontaneous evacuation of postoperative Douglas abscess to rectum. Young woman with abdominal pain and fever 10 days
after surgery for perforated appendicitis. CT shows a bilobar puscollection, close to the thick-walled,
empty rectum (R.). TVUS confirms the abscess, and demonstrates an echolucent
tract (*) from the abscess towards the rectal lumen (R.)  with focal blurring of the layer structure of
the oedematous rectal wall. 
These TVUS findings, in combination with the improving
symptoms of the patient, are signs of impending spontaneous evacuation. Three days later the thick-walled abscess is almost
empty. 
The patient recovered without surgical or radiological drainage. Malignant peritonitis detected by TVUS. Elderly lady with malaise, weightloss and at transabdominal
US only some ascites. TVUS demonstrates slightly hyperechoic ascites and
multiple, vascularized tumour deposits on the peritoneum, strongly suspect for
malignant peritonitis.
TVUS for Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis:
Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE) DIE is a potentially devastating, gynaecological
condition. 
By repeated episodes of bleeding, resorption and the resulting formation
of scar tissue, the endometriotic implants may cause pain, dyspareunia and subfertility. DIE, if localized in Douglas pouch and the
vesico-uterine recess, may aggressively invade the rectum, bladder and ureters,
with all its sequelae, as colonic obstruction, micturition problems and hydronephrosis. In prominent, longstanding DIE, the resulting bulky
scar tissue of DIE (*), may cause narrowing, and eventually total obstruction, of
the colonic lumen. In this young lady with unexplained chronic abdominal
symptoms for many years, CT and subsequent MRI demonstrated extensive endometriosis. In addition there are large, adhesive endometriotic cysts
(“kissing ovaries”),   bilateral hydronephrosis and complete
obstruction of the colon, due to ingrowth of endometriosis in the ureters and the rectum.
Background:
There are many reasons for diagnostic delay in
DIE.
The symptoms of DIE are chronic, atypical and often non-cyclical.
Gynaecological
TVUS often shows a normal uterus and normal ovaries.
The lab findings are usually
normal and colonoscopy in DIE is often inconclusive Even laparoscopy can be non-diagnostic
because DIE may hide under adhesions. MRI of DIE (*) yields pathognomonic images, but is
only performed when there is clinical suspicion of endometriosis. TVUS provides a unique opportunity to make the diagnosis
of DIE in patients who undergo routine examination for aspecific symptoms.
DIE of the rectum:
The images are of a patient with DIE and a normal aspect of uterus and
ovaries. DIE has typical, almost pathognomonic TVUS features. 
Although
obviously a gynaecological condition, it is not infrequently overlooked by
gynaecologists during TVUS. The reason is that the majority of
patients with DIE (*), lack the typical endometriotic cysts and have, as in the
patient here, a normal uterus and ovaries (L. OV. and R. OV.). Furthermore, the
TVUS diagnosis of DIE requires thorough knowledge of the US image of normal and
pathological bowel and bladder, which knowledge may be absent in gynaecologists. (See also: “US of the GI tract: normal anatomy”) DIE implants on the outer surface of the colon in four
different patients. DIE implants (*) in Douglas pouch, are asymmetrically
localized, solid, hypoechoic, poorly vascularized masses, which are continuous
with the outer hypoechoic muscularis layer of the colon. The overlying hyperechoic submucosa,  and also the colonic mucosa are generally intact.
This explains also why blood in the stool is quite rare in DIE. The outer contour of these hypoechoic masses is mostly
firmly adherent to uterus and/or cervix. Often there is spiculation or “tethering”
visible on the outer margins. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Adherence to the uterus and cervix can be demonstrated by gently pushing with the probe to-and-fro. Whereas the normal sigmoid and rectum can easily be pushed away from the uterus with the probe (“sliding phenomenon”), the adhesions (arrow) belonging to DIE (*) block the entrance of the probe into the posterior fornix. In this videoclip, the transvaginal probe is gently
moved to-and-fro. The implant (*) has developed firm adhesions between uterus
and colon, which prevent entering of the probe deeper in the direction of the
sacrum. In the normal situation, uterus and colon can be easily be pushed aside. TVUS image of DIE with operative specimen. In this patient, the hyperechoic submucosa of the ventral
sigmoid wall, clearly overlies the large DIE implant (*). Note also the completely
normal dorsal sigmoid wall. The resected specimen shows that the (sub)mucosa
(arrows) is intact and overlies the DIE (*). As expected, also this patient had
no history of rectal bloodloss. Image orientation in TVUS and MRI For a proper understanding of the TVUS image of DIE
and especially the correlation with the MRI images, it is important to realize the
different orientations used in both image modalities. In the upper three rows, the “MRI-orientation”
prevails, and the upper-right TVUS image is therefore is 1. flipped
horizontally (mirror view) and 2. rotated anti-clockwise about 120 degrees. Although one might argue that this flipped and rotated
image corresponds better to the sagittal MRI, pattern recognition benefits from
using the “classic” TVUS view, as shown in the bottom image.
Differentiating DIE from carcinoma:
Differentiating rectal cancer from DIE of the rectum. Both conditions appear as solid, moderately defined, rather
hypoechoic, asymmetrically localized masses arising from the rectum with a
tendency to narrow the lumen. TVUS may be key to discriminate the two. In DIE the hypoechoic mass is hypovascular, it is localized
at the outer contour of the rectum and is continuous with the hypoechoic muscularis.
The submucosa and mucosa of the colon are intact. In rectal CA, the hypoechoic mass is hypervascular and
the mass originates from the mucosa, with focal loss of layer structure as a
consequence of transmural tumour growth. Longstanding actinomycosis mimicking DIE.
Differentiating DIE from actinomycosis:
A 43-year old woman with longstanding lower pelvic
pain. During routine US (not shown here) an ill-understood asymmetrical rectal
wall thickening with inflammation of the surrounding fat was found. A CT was advised. Images
CT and subsequent MRI confirmed the US findings and also
showed extension of the abnormalities to the pararectal fascia and cervix. 
Within the mass (*) small areas of necrosis or fluid were seen. 
CRP was 2.
TVUS showed oedematous. thickening of an otherwise
normal rectum, and an atypical hypoechoic mass (*) right posteriorly,
surrounded by hyperechoic, non-compressible fat. 
The mass felt very hard at toucher.
An atypical form of DIE was suggested. Eventually, deep EUS guided colonoscopic biopsies showed
a fibrosing, low-grade infection, and no features of endometriosis or
malignancy. The diagnosis of actinomycosis was suggested. After six months of
intravenous penicillin (port-a-cath), only minimal residual abnormalities
remained. The patient was pain free. Fifteen years earlier an IUD had been
removed.  The low CRP was compatible with
longstanding, low grade infection. No bacteriological proof was obtained.
Bladder endometriosis:
Coincidental finding of “bladder polyp” (arrow) on CT
scan in young female. Confirmation of a flat polypoid structure (arrow) by
abdominal US. Cystoscopy was completely normal, indicating that the
mass is covered by normal bladder mucosa.. TVUS  demonstrates
that the mass in fact is an endometriotic implant and shows blurring of the
hyperechoic contour (*) of the uterus, indicating local ingrowth.
TVUS also
demonstrated DIE in Douglas pouch (not shown here). A 45-year old woman with a long history of painful
micturition. Cystoscopy was negative. CT shows a plaque-like, irregularly defined mass
(arrow). TVUS confirms a large endometriotic implant (arrow) in
the prevesical space (cavum Retzii). Note again the ill-defined border with the
uterus. Enable Scroll

Ileum endometriosis:
A 32-year old woman with a long history of chronic
abdominal pain. US revealed a poorly vascularized hypoechoic mass
between ileum and cecum (DIE). The mass was continuous with the muscularis, and
spared  the (sub)mucosa of ileum and cecum.
Although there was no local pain on pressure, an endometriotic implant was
suggested. Subsequent MRI revealed extensive DIE affecting not
only the ileocecal region, but also Douglas pouch and the cavum Retzii. A 34-year old woman with known extensive pelvic DIE,
presented with subacute pain in the RLQ. A large polylobular mass was found  on CT. The corresponding abdominal US confirmed the mass to
be multiple coalescent DIE implants, leaving the hyperechoic submucosa of the
ileum intact. (a and v = iliac artery and vein)
Appendix endometriosis:
Enlarged, hyperattenuating tip of the appendix on CT
scan in 43-year old woman, with previous extirpation of uterus and adnexa  for DIE. TVUS revealed a solid, moderately vascularized, extrinsic
mass (*) in close contact with a thin appendix (arrow), suspect for endometriosis.
However malignancy could not be excluded. Appendectomy revealed a longitudinally oriented endometriotic
implant on the appendix tip. A 26-year old woman presents with recurrent subacute pain RLQ. US shows an -at that time ill-understood-  intussusception containing a small, solid, vascularized mass, in the region of the cecum. Malignancy was suggested. At surgery a “tumour mass” was found originating from the cecal pole, where the appendix was expected. This mass could be stapled-off safely, and turned out to be the appendix, intussuscepted into the cecum due to extensive endometriosis.
Epilogue:
The author thanks his fellow radiologists for their valuable help in collecting all the educational material. A special thanks to gynaecologist Jan Lind, for his advice in editing the manuscript. Finally, for all those interested in DIE, I strongly recommend the excellent youtube-lecture of gynaecologist Sofie Piessens from Melbourne.

Lumbar Disc Herniation:

and other causes of nerve compression:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Rijnland hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2014-12-14 In this article a systematic approach to patients with nerve root compression in the lumbar region is presented. We wil discuss disc herniation, facet arthrosis, synovial cysts, spondylolisthesis and epidural lipomatosis. The images can be enlarged by clicking on them.
Systematic approach:

Four levels of nerve compression:
In patients with symptoms of nerve root compression, there are four levels that need to be studied: This is the most common area where nerves are compressed. Mostly by herniated discs and less frequently due to spinal stenosis.
2. Level of lateral recess. This is the area below the disc where the nerve runs more laterally towards the foramen. Narrowing of the lateral recess is caused by facet arthrosis, usually in combination with hypertrophy of the flavum ligament and bulging of the disc.
3. Foramen. This is the area between two pedicles, where the nerve leaves the spinal canal. Narrowing of the foramen is seen in facet arthrosis, spondylolisthesis and foraminal disc herniation - usually a migrated disc from a lower level.
4. Extra-foraminal. This is the area lateral to the foramen. Nerve compression in this area is uncommon, but is sometimes caused by a laterally herniated disc. At these four levels there can be a lot of overlap of pathology. For instance a herniated disc can cause nerve compression at the level of the disc, but also at the level of the foramen or extra-foraminal when there is migration of the disc. When you are looking for nerve compression, you have to study all these levels. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images to see how the nerves run at the level of the disc, lateral recess, foramen and extra-foraminal. At each level specific pathology can be seen, but there is a lot of overlap. For instance a disc can herniate and cause nerve compression at the level of the disc, but can also migrate to a lower level and compress the nerve in the lateral recess or move upward and cause compression at the level of the foramen or extra-foraminal. In patients with facet arthrosis the bony spurs can move medially and narrow the lateral recess or move upward and narrow the foramen. When there is extreme facet arthrosis bilaterally, it can cause stenosis of the spinal canal and compress all the nerve roots at that level.
Anatomy:
The illustration demonstrates the structures that surround the nerves within the spinal canal. Flavum ligament The flavum ligament is a strong ligament on the interior posterior side of the vertebral canal that connects the laminae of adjacent vertebrae. As a result of aging and instability of the vertebral column due to facet arthrosis there will be more stress on the flavum ligament resulting in hypertrophy and fibrosis. Hypertrophy of the flavum ligament is usually seen in combination with facet arthrosis and both result in stenosis of the lateral recess or when it is bilateral, in spinal stenosis. Epidural fatThis is the fat that surrounds the dural sac, that contains the nerves. Abundant fat can be seen in steroid therapy, extreme obesitas and rarely idiopathic. Abundant epidural fat can contribute to stenosis of the spinal canal.
MRI protocol:
The MRI protocol for examination of the lumbar spine in patients with symptoms of nerve compression is quite simple. Basically we rely on the sagittal T1W- and T2W-images and correlate the findings with the transverse T2W-images of the levels of suspected pathology. Do not use a saturation band on the anterior side or a rectangular field of view (RFOV), because you also want to image the prevertebral soft tissues. Especially look for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, since this may also be the cause of low back pain. Sometimes it can be difficult to clinically differentiate neurogenic claudication - which is caused by spinal stenosis - from vascular claudication - which is caused by arterial stenosis. The frequency-encoding should be in the AP-direction and consequently the phase-encoding feet-head. This has several advantages: We want the highest resolution in the AP-direction to look for small herniations and delineation of nerve roots.
2. When you have the phase encoding in the AP-direction, you get breating artifacts. That is why some use a saturation band or the RFOV. With the frequency-encoding in the AP-direction you do not have these problems and you do not need a saturation band.
3. Frequency encoding in the feet-head direction can result in poor deliniation of the vertebral endplates due to chemical shift artifact when the fat in the vertebral body meets the water in the disc. This is another reason to use a feet-head phase encoding and an AP frequency encoding. It is better to have continuous slices with the same angulation parallel to the level where nerve compression is suspected. This has the advantage, that you can follow the involved nerve along the four levels of possible compression. When you examine multiple levels with different angulation like in the example on the right, you will not be able to follow the whole nerve tract and you will not get the whole picture.
Interpretation:
The sagittal T1W-images give you the most diagnostic information. Before you start looking for any hernias, first take a good look at the prevertebral tissues and bone marrow. Once you have detected any abnormality, correlate these findings with the T2W-images (figure). Use of a marker When you notice an abnormality, it can be helpful to use a marker that correlates with the same location on the other series. If you enlarge the image, you will see the small yellow cross, which indicates that you are looking at the exact same spot on the other series. Here the L5 nerve on the right is compressed by a synovial cyst, which is the result of facet arthrosis with effusion within the intervertebral joints.
Prevertebral tissues:
Here a 25 year old patient who presented with low back pain. Notice multiple small masses in the abdomen surrounding the mesenteric vessels and abnormal low signal intensity of the bone marrow. The signal intensity of the discus is a little bit higher compared to the bone marrow (bright discus sign). This examination was the first indication of an abnormality in this patient. This proved to be bone- and lymph node metastases of a carcinoma of the colon. Here another patient with widespread lymphadenopathy in the mesenterium and retroperitoneum. Here a patient, who presented with severe low back pain. Notice the aortic dissection. Sometimes these aortic abnormalities are incidental findings.
Disc herniation:
Disc herniation is displacement of disc material like nucleus pulposus, parts of the annulus fibrosus and cartilage, beyond the limits of the intervertebral disc space. It can be focal ( < 90º), broad-based ( 90º-180º) or caused by bulging of the disc (> 180º). Protrusion indicates that the distance between the edges of the disc herniation is less than the distance between the edges of the base. Extrusion is present when the distance between the edges of the disc material is greater than the distance at the base. Read Spine - Disc Nomenclature for more information about disc herniation nomenclature. Here a focal protrusion at the L5S1 level. The S1 nerve is compressed (arrow). Enable Scroll

3. At the level of the lateral recess, there is a focal herniation of disc material compressing the L5 nerve (yellow arrow). This is called an extrusion, because the distance between the edges of the disc material is greater than the distance at the base.
4. Compressed L5 nerve (blue arrow) within the lateral recess. The herniated disc has migrated caudally and is seen as an oval structure anterior to the nerve. The herniated disc is uncontained, i.e. not covered by fibers of the annulus. First study the images. Click to enlarge them. Then continue reading. The findings are: Click to enlarge The signal intensity of a hernia on T1W-images is usually intermediate, while on T2W-images it can be a high signal fresh herniated nucleus pulposus or a somewhat older low signal intensity hernia. Here a herniation with high signal (yellow arrow on transverse images) sliding through the annular tear and compressing the left L5 nerve (blue arrow). Here sagittal T1W-images demonstrating a structure of very low signal intensity at the L4L5 level (arrow) and at the L5S1 level. Continue with the T2W-images. T2W-images Also on the T2W-images the signal intensity is very low. A CT-scan was performed to see if this could be a calcified herniated disc or some artifact. Continue with the CT-images. The low signal intensity could finally be explained by the vacuum phenomena due to nitrogen gas within the herniated disc both on L4L5 (red arrow) and L5S1 level (blue arrow) Enable Scroll

Notice that at the L4L5 level the migrated disc simulates a nerve root (green arrow), while in fact the nerve is compressed posteriorly and subsequently moves to the foramen (yellow arrow).
Lateral recess stenosis:
Stenosis of the lateral recess is a common problem especially in older patients. The stability of the vertebral column decreases, which results in instability. This results in hypertrophy of the facet joints and arthrosis, bulging of the disc and more stress on the flavum ligament resulting in hypertrophy. All these mechanisms lead to stenosis of the lateral recess (figure). In advances cases of arthrosis a synovial cyst may form, which contributes to the narrowing. Enable Scroll

Synovial cyst:
Synovial cysts are frequently seen in combination with facet arthrosis. Mostly they lead to stenosis of the lateral facet. When they are very large they can protrude into the foramen and cause foraminal stenosis. Here a patient with severe arthrosis of the facet joints. Notice that there are many synovial cysts related to the arthrosis (red arrows). At the L5S1 level a large cyst on the right compresses the S1-nerve (yellow arrow). Enable Scroll

Synovial cysts can be easily overlooked. On these T2W-images it looks as if the foramen is normal. Notice that the nerve is missing. In fact the neuroforamen is almost completely filled by the synovial cyst, which compresses the nerve root against the vertebra (arrows). The nerve can hardly be seen.
Stenosis of the Spinal Canal:
Causes of spinal stenosis: Most common Less common Notice the diffuse narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal. It is best seen on the MR-images, but can already be suspected on the radiograph, because the pedicles are very short. You may have to enlarge the image to appreciate this. On the axial T2W-images you can see, that there is no CSF visible surrounding the nerve roots. This means that there is a severe spinal stenosis. The epidural fat compresses the nerves from posteriorly. Here another example of spinal stenosis. Again on the radiograph you can suspect congenital narrowing. Usually a small hernia or bulging is enough to cause nerve compression in these patients. On the axial T2W-images a severe spinal stenosis is seen. Notice the short pedicles in combination with facet arthrosis and flavum hypertrophy. Here a patient with multiple osseus metastases. At the level of L1L2 this causes spinal stenosis with compression of the nerves (red arrow). It is not that common for metastases to cause nerve compression at the lumbar level. At the thoracic and cervical level metastases frequently cause compression because there is not much CSF surrounding the myelum. Fractures can cause stenosis of the spinal canal especially when there is displacement of bony structures like in burst fractures and fractures with rotation and translation. Here a patient with an old burst fracture. There is retropulsion of the posterosuperior fragment (red arrow) compressing the cauda (blue arrow).
Epidural lipomatosis:
Epidural lipomatosis is excessive amount of fat within the epidural space compressing the thecal sac. Patients present with symptoms of spinal canal stenosis. It is seen in patients with obesity, like in this case and in patients who are treated with steroids. Continue with the axial images of this patient. Enable Scroll

Foraminal stenosis:
Causes of Foraminal stenosis: Stenosis of the neuroforamen is usually the result of a combination of upward disc herniation and facet arthrosis. It is also frequently seen in patients with spondylolisthesis. Spondylolisthesis is a condition in which one vertebra slips forward over the one below it, usually L4 upon L5. The shift results from either spondylolysis (stress fracture of the pars interarticularis) or facetarthrosis with sliding of the facets.

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images of a patient with spondylolisthesis. Here a disc herniation with upward migration. By using the marker, you can correlate the abnormality on the T1W-image with the axial T2W-images. On the T2W-image it is more obvious that this is a disc herniation. The lower images are with the marker on. you may have to enlarge the images to see it. These foraminal disc herniations can be easily overlooked. Notice how subtle the findings are on the axial T2W-images. The herniated disc can be easily mistaken for the nerve root. The sagittal T1W-image shows the upward migration of the disc. Here a patient with a combination of spondylolysis (arrow), minimal listhesis and disc herniation resulting in compression of the L3 nerve within the foramen. Here a patient with severe anterolisthesis due to bilateral spondylolysis. The anteroposition in combination with the upward movement of the disc has resulted in severe narrowong of the foramen and nerve compression (yellow arrow). Notice the calcification of the uppper part of the disc (blue arrow).
Extraforaminal nerve compression:
Extraforaminal nerve compression is seen in about 5% of cases. Almost always it is a lateral disc herniation from a lower level that compresses the extraforaminal part of the nerve. Here an example of a lateral disc herniation that produces compression of the superiorly exiting nerve root and ganglion. Notice the L4 nerve (red arrow), which is being displaced posteriorly by a lateral disc herniation at the L4-5 level (green arrow).

Imaging in Acute Stroke:
Majda Thurnher
Department of Radiology, Medical University of Vienna:
Publicationdate 2008-06-30 This review is based on a presentation given by Majda Thurnher and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. We will discuss the following subjects: How to identify patients with tissue at risk for guidance in selecting the appropriate therapy Introduction
Introduction:
Penumbra: Occlusion of the MCA with irreversibly affected or dead tissue in black and tissue at risk or penumbra in red. The goal of imaging in a patient with acute stroke is: In this way we can select patients who are candidates for thrombolytic therapy.
CT Early signs of ischemia:
CT has the advantage of being available 24 hours a day and is the gold standard for hemorrhage. Hemorrhage on MR images can be quite confusing. On CT 60% of infarcts are seen within 3-6 hrs and virtually all are seen in 24 hours. The overall sensitivity of CT to diagnose stroke is 64% and the specificity is 85%. In the table on the left the early CT-signs of cerebral infarction are listed. MCA infarction: on CT an area of hypoattenuation appearing within six hours is highly specific for irreversible ischemic brain damage.
Hypo attenuating brain tissue:
The reason we see ischemia on CT is that in ischemia cytotoxic edema develops as a result of failure of the ion-pumps. These fail due to an inadequate supply of ATP. An increase of brain water content by 1% will result in a CT attenuation decrease of 2.5 HU. On the left a patient with hypoattenuating brain tissue in the right hemisphere. The diagnosis is infarction, because of the location (vascular territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and because of the involvement of gray and white matter, which is also very typical for infarction. Hypoattenuation on CT is highly specific for irreversible ischemic brain damage if it is detected within first 6 hours (1). Patients who present with symptoms of stroke and who demonstrate hypodensity on CT within first six hours were proven to have larger infarct volumes, more severe symptoms, less favorable clinical courses and they even have a higher risk of hemorrhage. Therefore whenever you see hypodensity in a patient with stroke this means bad news. No hypodensity on CT is a good sign. Obscuration of the lentiform nucleus or blurred basal ganglia
Obscuration of the lentiform nucleus:
Obscuration of the lentiform nucleus, also called blurred basal ganglia, is an important sign of infarction. It is seen in middle cerebral artery infarction and is one of the earliest and most frequently seen signs (2). The basal ganglia are almost always involved in MCA-infarction. Two patients with insular ribbon sign
Insular Ribbon sign:
This refers to hypodensity and swelling of the insular cortex. It is a very indicative and subtle early CT-sign of infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. This region is very sensitive to ischemia because it is the furthest removed from collateral flow. It has to be differentiated from herpes encephalitis.
Dense MCA sign:
This is a result of thrombus or embolus in the MCA. On the left a patient with a dense MCA sign. On CT-angiography occlusion of the MCA is visible.
Hemorrhagic infarcts:
15% of MCA infarcts are initially hemorrhagic. Hemorrhage is most easily detected with CT, but it can also be visualized with gradient echo MR-sequences.
CTA and CT Perfusion:
Normal CTA Once you have diagnosed the infarction, you want to know which vessel is involved by performing a CTA. First look at the images on the left and try to detect the abnormality. Then continue reading. The findings in this case are very subtle. There is some hypodensity in the insular cortex on the right, which is the area we always look at first. In this case it is suggestive for infarction, but sometimes in older patients with leukencephalopathy it can be very difficult. A CTA was performed (see next images). Now we feel very comfortable with the diagnosis of MCA infarction. CT Perfusion (CTP) With CT and MR-diffusion we can get a good impression of the area that is infarcted, but we cannot preclude a large ischemic penumbra (tissue at risk). With perfusion studies we monitor the first pass of an iodinated contrast agent bolus through the cerebral vasculature. Perfusion will tell us which area is at risk. Approximately 26% of patients will require a perfusion study to come to the proper diagnosis.
The limitation of CT-perfusion is the limited coverage. Studies were performed to compare CT with MRI to see how much time it took to perform all the CT studies that were necessary to come to a diagnosis. It was demonstrated that Plain CT, CTP and CTA can provide comprehensive diagnostic information in less than 15 minutes, provided that you have a good team. In the case on the left first a non-enhanced CT was performed. If there is hemorrhage, then no further studies are necessary. In this case the CT was normal and a CTP was performed, which demonstrated a perfusion defect. A CTA was subsequently performed and a dissection of the left internal carotid was demonstrated.
MRI:
On PD/T2WI and FLAIR infarction is seen as high SI. These sequences detect 80% of infarctions before 24 hours. They may be negative up to 2-4 hours post-ictus! On the left T2WI and FLAIR demonstrating hyperintensity in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Notice the involvement of the lentiform nucleus and insular cortex. High signal on conventional MR-sequences is comparable to hypodensity on CT. It is the result of irreversible injury with cell death. So hyperintensity means BAD news: dead brain. DWI in posterior, anterior and middle cerebral infarction
Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI):
DWI is the most sensitive sequence for stroke imaging. DWI is sensitive to restriction of Brownian motion of extracellular water due to imbalance caused by cytotoxic edema. Normally water protons have the ability to diffuse extracellularly and loose signal. High intensity on DWI indicates restriction of the ability of water protons to diffuse extracellularly. First look at the images on the left and try to detect the abnormality. Then continue reading. The findings in this case are very subtle. There is some hypodensity and swelling in the left frontal region with effacement of sulci compared with the contralateral side. You probably only notice these findings because this is an article about stroke and you would normally read this as 'no infarction'. Now continue with the DWI images of this patient. When we look at the DWI-images it is very easy and you don't have to be an expert radiologist to notice the infarction. This is why DWI is called 'the stroke sequence'. Signal intensities on T2WI and DWI in time (courtesy Dr M. Law) When we compare the findings on T2WI and DWI in time we will notice the following: Pseudo-normalization of DWI in a 2 weeks old posterior infarction. Pseudo-normalization of DWI This occurs between 10-15 days. The case on the left shows a normal DWI. On T2WI there is may be some subtle hyperintensity in the right occipital lobe in the vascular territory of the posterior cerebral artery. The T1WI after the administration of Gadolinium shows gyral enhancement indicating infarction. First it was thought that everything that is bright on DWI is dead tissue. However now there are some papers suggesting that probably some of it may be potentially reversible damage. If you compare the DWI images in the acute phase with the T2WI in the chronic phase, you will notice that the affected brain volume in DWI is larger compared to the final infarcted area (respectively 62cc and 17cc).
Perfusion MR Imaging:
Perfusion with MR is comparable to perfusion CT. A compact bolus of Gd-DTPA is delivered through a power injector. Multiple echo-planar images are made with a high temporal resolution. T2* gradient sequences are used to maximize the susceptibility signal changes. The area with abnormal perfusion can be dead tissue or tissue at risk. Combining the diffusion and perfusion images helps us to define the tissue at risk, i.e. the penumbra. Diffusion in yellow. Perfusion in red. Mismatch in blue is penumbra. On the left we first have a diffusion image indicating the area with irreversible changes (dead tissue). In the middle there is a large area with hypoperfusion. On the right the diffusion-perfusion mismatch is indicated in blue. This is the tissue at risk. This is the brain tissue that maybe can be saved with therapy. T2WI and PDWI in a patient with sudden onset of neurological symptoms. On the left a patient with sudden onset of neurological symptoms.
MR was performed 1 hour after onset of symptoms.
First look at the images on the left and try to detect the abnormality. Then continue reading. These images are normal and we have to continue with DWI.
See next images. DWI and PI On the DWI there is a large area with restricted diffusion in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Notice also the involvement of the basal ganglia. There is a perfect match with the perfusion images, so this patient should not undergo any form of thrombolytic therapy. On the left another MCA infarction. It is clearly visible on CT (i.e. irreversible changes). There is a match of DWI and Perfusion, so no therapy. On the left another case. The DWI and ADC map is shown. Continue for the perfusion images Perfusion images demonstrating large penumbra Now we can see that there is a severe mismatch. Almost the whole left cerebral hemisphere is at risk due to hypoperfusion. This patient is an ideal candidate for therapy. by R von Kummer et al. Radiology 1997, Vol 205, 327-333,

Ultrasound of the Neonatal spine:
Erik Beek and Simone ter Horst and Robin Smithuis and Rutger Jan Nievelstein
Department of Radiology of the Wilhelmina Childrens Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate October 29, 2019 Ultrasound is the preferred modality in neonates with suspected occult spinal dysraphism (OSD).
OSD implies the presence of one or more spinal cord anomalies, which can cause tethering of the spinal cord and possible neurological and bladder or bowel function deficits. Ultrasound is easy to perform, since the posterior arch of the vertebra is not yet ossified, providing a perfect acoustic window. 
Especially the lumbosacral part of the spinal canal with the conus medullaris and the cauda equina can be beautifully depicted with a high resolution linear array probe.
Classification of Spinal dysraphism:

Spina bifida aperta:
Spinal dysraphism or spina bifida is a congenital anomaly resulting in a defective closure of the neural arch.
It is classified into open (spina bifida aperta) and closed dysraphism (spina bifida occulta). Open dysraphism presents with a swelling over the back which is noticed at birth and may contain meninges and CSF, called meningocele or contain parts of the spinal cord or nerves, called myelomeningocele. Ultrasound should not be used to image open spinal dysraphism at the lesion itself. 
It does not add much and can lead to infection. 
Ultrasound can be used to examine more cranial parts of the vertebral column, searching for additional anomalies and is useful to measure the size of the ventricles of the brain after closure of the myelomeningocele.
Spina bifida occulta:
In closed or occult spinal dysraphism, also called spina bifida occulta, there is an intact covering of the skin. The anomaly is suspected when there are skin changes like hair tufts, hemangiomas, pigmented spots, cutaneous dimples or a subcutaneous mass. Another reason to perform ultrasound is when there is a congenital anomaly that is associated with OSD like anal atresia. The term OSD implies the presence of one or more spinal cord anomalies, which can cause tethering of the spinal cord and possible neurological and bladder/bowel function deficits. 
The terms thickened or fatty filum terminale, spinal lipomas, split cord malformations, dermoid cyst, and syringohydromyelia are all different forms of OSD.
Normal anatomy:
Click to enlarge The spinal cord is depicted as a very hypoechoic structure with a central echogenicity. 
This central echogenicity is supposed to represent the interface between the anterior commissure and the median anterior fissure, and not the central canal. Axial image of the spinal cord with central echogenicity. Axial image of the cauda equina. The lower end of the cord is thickened, which is the lumbar intumescence. The cord tapers in a sharp cone (blue arrow). The cauda equina is seen as a bunch of moving strands.
If the baby is lying in the decubitus position, the strands will gravitate to the dependent posterior side.
If the baby is examined in the prone position with a pillow under the abdomen, the stands will move ventrally. The filum terminale can be seen as a thin echogenic thread.
The dural sac ends at approximately S2. 
More distally fatty tissue is present. Video of the normal sagittal anatomy. Always obtain axial views. 
The movement of the nerve roots is better seen in the transverse plane compared to the sagittal plane and it is easier to assess intraspinal pathology like a thickened filum. Film in right decubitus position.
The nerve roots are clustered in the dependent side, but move freely. When the nerve roots do not move freely, it can be a sign of OSD.
Position of the conus medullaris:
The normal position of the conus is at L!.
It should not be below L2. The best way to determine the position of the conus medullaris is by identifying the lumbosacral junction at the lordotic angle between the lumbar and sacral vertebrae (arrow).
It can be helpful to flex and extend the pelvis to see the point of motion of the sacrum. In this newborn the lumbosacral junction is less clearly seen because there is no acute angle.
The numbers that we've put in, might be wrong. If one is uncertain, make a panoramic or dual image of the lumbosacral vertebral column and compare the vertebral count from below upwards with a lateral plain film. Sagittal view of a normal "kyphotic" coccyx in a 2-day-old girl The coccyx, if not yet ossified, is composed of hypoechoic cartilage. 
It usually has a kyphotic shape. 
On transverse views it should not be confused with a fluid collection or an abscess.
Normal variants:
Two-week-old girl with a sacral simple. There is a slight hydromyelia (white arrow) and a cyst in the filum terminale (yellow arrow), both are normal variants. Central canal
In this image the central canal is visible as a thin anechoic line in the spinal cord (white arrow). 
Although this is sometimes associated with pathology it is frequently seen as a normal finding. Ventriculus terminalis 
A small cyst is seen in the proximal filum terminale. 
This is called a ventriculus terminalis (or fifth ventricle).
Sometimes it is seen in the conus medullaris.
It is formed during embryogenesis and usually regresses completely during early childhood.
If it stays persistent, it typically measures less than 2 cm in craniocaudal dimension and 2 mm in transverse dimension and is detected as an asymptomatic and incidental finding in adults. Here a sagittal image of a three-months-old girl who was imaged because of a skin discoloration of the lower back.
The spinal anatomy was normal and there was no sign of OSD. There is a straight coccyx, which is a normal variant.
Usually the coccyx has a anteriorly bent tip, but sometimes it is straight or even dorsally bent, which is also a normal variant.
Pathology:

Tethered cord:
In many cases occult spinal dysraphism may not cause any symptoms.
However in some cases there may develop neurological problems due to tethering of the cord. A tethered cord is a pathologic fixation of the spinal cord in an abnormal caudal location, so that the cord suffers mechanical stretching, distortion and ischemia with growth and development. In these cases ultrasound is well suited to image the contents of the spinal canal and to look for findings that are associated with a tethered cord (Table).
Low conus medullaris:
Newborn girl with a cloacal malformation.
The conus medullaris is at L5. 
No lipoma visible. 
Findings were confirmed at MR imaging which was acquired at the age of 9 months.
Continue with the MR. MR image at the age of 9 months. The conus medullaris is now seen at L4.
Thickened filum terminale:
Study the image.
What are the findings? Findings:
The plain film shows a fusion of S4 and S5. This was a newborn boy with an anorectal malformation.
An ultrasound was performed to look for signs of occult spinal dysraphism. This is the transverse video There is a thickened filum with a low ending conus medullaris at L3-L4 and a mild hydromyelia. Continue with the sagittal video. On the sagittal video the low ending conus medullaris is seen at L3-L4. Continue with the MRI. The MRI also depicts: The upper limit of normal for the width of the filum terminale is 2 mm. 
If it is thickened it often shows fatty infiltration with hyperechoic tissue. In healthy newborns, the tip of the conus medullaris is located between L1 and L2. 
The tip should not be positioned below L2-3.
Hydromyelia:
A hydromyelia is the abnormal widening of the central canal by cerebrospinal fluid. This condition may be either focal or diffuse, extending through the entire length of the spinal cord. It can be associated with several congenital abnormalities including diastematomyelia, Arnold‐Chiari malformation, myelomeningocele and lipomeningocele. If there is a fluid collection in the cord outside the central canal it is called syringomyelia. 
Because it is often not possible to separate these two entities on imaging, it is better to use the term syringohydromyelia. 
Transverse images will show the transition of the normal cord into the cord which surrounds a CSF collection
Spinal lipoma:
A spinal lipoma is an encapsulated deposit of fat, neural tissue, meninges or fibrous tissue which extends from the posterior subcutaneous tissue through a midline defect of the fascia, muscle or bone to communicate with the spinal canal or meninges. A spinal lipoma is seen as an echogenic mass, mostly in the lower spinal canal.
The conus can be too low and buried in the lipoma. Here a sagittal image of a newborn boy with anal atresia.
The conus is blunted and ends at L2-L3. There is an echogenic mass which is likely a lipoma.
The filum is thickened. Small lipomas are often led alone. Bigger lipomas in symptomatic patients are removed. On a transverse video the ecogenic mass just below the cord terminus is seen.
Dorsal dermal sinus:
This is a connection between the skin and the dural sac, sometimes into the spinal cord. 
It presents with a dimple, discoloration of the skin or hairy patches. The conus medullaris can be too low. Three-day-old girl with a red stain on the lower back, a tuft of hair and a dimple. US shows a tract from the skin towards the dural sac at the S1-S2 level, compatible with a dorsal dermal sinus .
The conus medullaris is at a normal level and there is no other intraspinal pathology present. A T1-weigthed image shows the sinus tract from the skin towards the S1-S2 level. The conus medullaris is too low at L3-L4. Dermal sinus tracts  are especially important lesions to recognize because they can extend to the spinal canal and represent an increased risk of infection such as meningitis and spinal cord abscess.
Diastematomyelia:
Diastematomyelia, also named split cord malformation, is a longitudinal split of the spinal cord. 
At the point of division, there may be an osseous, fibrous or cartilaginous dividing septum.
Diastematomyelia is commonly associated with a vertebral column abnormality and a tethered spinal cord. The ultrasound diagnosis is usually straightforward. Here images of a newborn, who had several antenatal anomalies. There was a lateral rocker bottom feet deformity, lumbar kyphoscoliosis and swelling on the lower back. The spinal US and MR show a longitudinal split of the spinal cord at the thoracolumbar level. The bifid cord is asymmetric in volume. Additional plain films of the lumbar spine and pelvis showed thoracic and lumbar hemivertebrae. There was also a dislocated left hip. Newborn girl with an anorectal malformation. The distal sacrum below S4 is absent.
Blunt cord terminus:
This image is of a newborn girl with an anorectal malformation. 
The distal sacrum below S4 is absent (arrow).
Since an anorectal malformation is frequently associated with spinal pathology, an ultrasound was performed. If a plain film of the vertebral column demonstrates an anomaly of the sacrum, there is a 50% change of an intraspinal anomaly. In most cases there is a low ending tethered cord. In some cases however the cord ends at the normal position, but is deformed. This is a so-called blunt cord terminus.
There is generally a wedge-shaped ending in which the dorsal side reaches further caudally than the ventral side. Continue with the ultrasound. Ultrasound of the spine shows a blunt cord terminus at T12-L1. A blunt cord terminus is a sign of caudal regression syndrome characterized by abnormal development of the lower end of the spine. On ultrasound the absent coccyx is also visible. Continue with the MRI. Sagittal T2-weigthed image showing the cord terminus at Th12. by Karin M. Unsinn, MD et al RadioGraphics 2000; 20:923–938

Rectal Cancer MR staging 3.0:
Doenja Lambregts, Rhiannon van Loenhout, Frank Zijta, Max Lahaye, Regina Beets-Tan and Robin Smithuis
Radiology Departement of the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, the Medical Centre Haaglanden in the Hague and the Alrijne Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2021-09-01 This is the third version describing the role of MRI for the staging and restaging of rectal cancer. The two major advancements in the treatment of rectal cancer are total mesorectal excision (TME) and neoadjuvant radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.
Both have dramatically changed the local recurrence and survival rates. MRI is the most accurate tool for the local staging of rectal cancer and is a powerful tool to select the appropriate treatment.
The decision whether a patient with rectal cancer is a candidate for TME only or neoadjuvant therapy followed by TME, is made on the findings of the MRI. This updated version includes: In the end section there are two videos on how to report rectal cancer according to the structured reporting checklist.
If you first want to look at the videos click here.
Introduction:
The illustration shows the mesorectum and the mesorectal fascia, which is the plane for TME resection and the relation of the rectum to the anal sphincter and pelvic floor.
Total Mesorectal Excision:
In TME the entire mesorectal compartment including the rectum, surrounding mesorectal fat and perirectal lymph nodes are completely removed along the mesorectal fascia (figure). TME is the standard surgical resection technique for rectal cancer and can be performed as either a low anterior resection (LAR) where the anal canal is left in situ or an abdominoperineal resection (APR), where both the rectum and anal canal are resected.
Risk Stratification:
Local staging with MRI is performed to determine the best surgical strategy and the necessity for neoadjuvant treatment. Criteria used to define low risk, intermediate risk and high risk disease and their use for treatment stratification vary between countries and guidelines and are continuously evolving. As a rule of thumb we can state the following: Low RiskT1, T2 and in several countries also early stage T3ab tumors without evidence of nodal metastases will generally be considered low risk and do not necessarily require neoadjuvant treatment. Intermediate RiskMore extensive T3 tumors and/or tumors with a limited number of suspicious nodes are often considered intermediate risk. A short course of radiotherapy (5 x 5 Gy) prior to TME has been shown to reduce the local recurrence risk for these intermediate risk tumors [ref]. High risk or Locally advancedAdvanced T3-4 tumors that invade the mesorectal fascia or adjacent organs, or tumors with many suspicious nodes (N2) are typically regarded as locally advanced. These generally receive a long course of combined chemoradiotherapy aiming to induce tumor downsizing and downstaging and enhance the chance of a complete surgical resection [ref]. More recently, the presence of extramural vascular (or venous) invasion has been proposed as an additional adverse prognostic feature that should be considered a sign of high risk disease. There is a growing tendency to consider minimally invasive or non-surgical treatment alternatives in tumors that show a complete or near-complete response after neoadjuvant treatment. 
MRI plays an important role in addition to endoscopy to help select the right patients for these “organ preserving” treatments. In addition to organ-preservation, recent advances in treatment include:
Structured Reporting Checklist:
Click for larger view A
good quality MRI report includes all risk factors used to stratify patients
into differentiated treatments, as well as an accurate description of the
relation of the tumor to its surrounding anatomy to inform surgical planning (figure). In
the following chapters we will discuss these various items listed in the reporting template in further detail TNM-prefixes “c” is used to indicate the clinical stage, determined before treatment.
When defined based on imaging, the prefix “i" (imaging) or “mr” (MRI) are sometimes used as alternatives. “y”
is used to restage tumors after neoadjuvant treatment (chemo and/or
radiotherapy) and can be used for both clinical staging (ycTNM) as well as
pathological staging (ypTNM). “p” indicates the final TNM stage as determined at histopathology after surgery.
Morphology:

Polypoid and Sessile tumors:
Rectal adenocarcinomas typically arise from adenomas that can be either polypoid, which are tumors raised upon a stalk or sessile, which are flat. Polypoid tumors generally represent more low-grade malignancies and present as a mass projecting into the bowel lumen with a focal attachment or stalk to the bowel wall. Sessile tumors typically present as a semi-circular  or circular wall thickening. The site where the tumor is attached to the rectal wall is often referred to as the “invasive margin” and is the site where we need to focus on when assessing the T-stage and looking for extramural tumor extension. The degree of attachment to the rectal wall, also referred to as the tumor circumference, can be described in the radiology report as “from … to … o’clock”, or alternatively using prose descriptions such as “left anterolateral”. Bright mucinous tumor versus solid tumor with intermediate signal.
Solid and Mucinous:
The
distinction between solid and mucinous tumor types is relevant because mucinous
adenocarcinomas have a poorer prognosis and
typically show a poorer response to neoadjuvant treatment. Mucinous tumors show
distinct bright signal on T2-weighted MRI compared to the more intermediate
signal of solid type tumors (figure). A
more rare subtype of rectal cancer is the signet-ring cell carcinoma, which is
associated with a high risk for nodal and distant metastases and poor overall
survival. It is seen in only approximately one percent of cases. On MRI signet-ring cell carcinomas can be difficult to
discern, though they typically show long-segment diffuse bowel wall thickening
and a submucosal growth pattern that results in a ‘target’ appearance on axial
images. The
images show a signet-ring cell carcinoma with diffuse thickening of the rectal
wall and the target appearance on the axial image. Also note the diffuse
infiltration of the mesorectal fat, which is another common finding of signet
ring tumors.
Location:

Sigmoid take-off:
Discriminating
rectal from sigmoid cancer is important because the treatment approach differs
considerably. Routine treatment for sigmoid cancer is upfront resection, while
rectal tumours undergo differentiated treatments varying from surgery only in
low risk tumors to long course neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in high risk
tumors. In
2019 an international consensus panel agreed on the “sigmoid take-off” as the preferred
landmark to define the rectosigmoid junction and separate the rectum from the
sigmoid on imaging (ref). The sigmoid take off can be recognized on sagittal MRI as the point from which the sigmoid sweeps horizontally away from the sacrum. The stippled line indicates the sigmoid take-off on a sagittal and axial view The sigmoid take-off can be recognized on sagittal MRI as the point from which the sigmoid sweeps horizontally away from the sacrum and on an axial view as the point from which the sigmoid projects ventrally (figure). Though recognizing the sigmoid take-off on imaging may be challenging in some cases due to anatomical variations between patients or varying sequence angulation, it is overall an intuitive landmark. Tumors above the level of the rectosigmoid junction with a lower border starting proximal to the sigmoid take-off are considered sigmoid tumors. Tumor height The
anorectal junction marks the transition between the anal canal and
distal rectum. It is situated at the level of the anorectal angle, which is
caused by contraction of the puborectalis muscle. 
On sagittal MRI the anorectal
junction is typically situated at the level of an imaginary line between the
lower margin of the sacral bone and pubic bone. A
common approach to determine the height of rectal tumors is to measure the
distance between the lower margin of the tumor and the anorectal junction, or
alternatively the distance from the anal verge, which is the transition between
the anal epithelium and perianal skin. In some countries such as the US the location of the tumor in relation to the anterior peritoneal reflection is commonly used as a landmark to determine the tumor height.
T-stage:
Click image for larger view This illustration shows the T-stages in the sagittal and axial plane. The table shows an overview of the T-staging. Low risk T3 tumors have minimal extension into the mesorectal fat up to 5mm (T3ab) and the mesorectal fascia is not involved (distance ≥1mm). High risk T3 tumors extend into the mesorectal fat by > 5mm or invade the mesorectal fascia. T4b tumors invade other organs or structures that are situated outside the mesorectum. The TNM classification system does not include a clear description of what is covered by the umbrella term “structures”. In an international multidisciplinary consensus meeting from 2021 an expert panel of radiologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists and pathologists proposed that T4b should include invasion of the structures as mentioned in the table [ref].
T1-T2 – limited to the bowel wall:
T1
and T2 tumors are limited to the bowel wall and have a relatively good
prognosis. The key finding to ensure that a tumor remains limited to the
bowel wall (T1-2) is the presence of an intact muscularis propria, which can be
recognized on MRI as an intact hypointense line surrounding the rectum. Image
A cT1-2 tumor in the distal rectum is shown with an intact muscularis
propria, which is clearly recognizable as a hypointense outer line of the
rectal wall. Pitfall: differentiating T1 from T2 Anatomically,
the rectal wall is comprised of 3 main layers: Typically,
these 3 separate layers on MRI can only be recognized in the case of submucosal
edema. In the absence of edema
the rectal wall generally has a two-layered appearance where we can recognize
the muscularis propria but cannot distinguish the mucosa from the submucosa. This
is the reason why MRI is generally unable to distinguish T1 tumors (growing
into the submucosa) from T2 tumors (growing into the muscularis propria). Endorectal ultrasound is more accurate for this purpose. Tumors that
remain limited to the rectal wall are therefore typically grouped as cT1-2 on MRI.
T3 – invasion into the mesorectal fat:
T3-tumors
grow through the muscularis propria into the surrounding mesorectum. On MRI this can be recognized as an interruption of the
hypointense muscularis propria with spicular or nodular extension of tumor
signal beyond the rectal wall into the mesorectal fat. Image
A semicircular rectum tumor with invasion into the mesorectum from
approximately 1 to 4 o’clock. It does not grow within 1mm of the mesorectal
fascia. The T-stage is T3 MRF- rectal cancer. Subclassification
of T3 stage according to invasion depth: Low-risk T3-tumors: High-risk T3-tumors: Pitfall: perirectal stranding It can be difficult to discern true perirectal tumor invasion in T3
tumors (case A) from desmoplastic stranding in T1-2 tumors (case B), which can
be a potential cause of overstaging. Note:  
The clinical significance
to discern T2 from borderline T3 tumors has been argued as various current  guidelines – including the Dutch guidelines –
classify T3 tumors with limited extension into the mesorectal fat (cT3ab) in
the same good prognostic group as T2 tumors for treatment stratification. In
some guidelines, however, T3 disease by itself is still considered a factor
used to determine the need for neoadjuvant treatment.
Mesorectal fascia involvement:
The mesorectal fascia (MRF) is a thin fibrous
structure  that encloses the mesorectal
compartment and comprises the anticipated resection plane in TME surgery. On
T2-weighted MRI the mesorectal fascia can be recognized as a thin hypointense
line surrounding the mesorectum. When a tumor directly invades the MRF or the margin between the tumor and MRF is ≤ 1 mm, the MRF is involved.
In these cases routine TME would induce a risk for local recurrence and neoadjuvant treatment will be required to induce tumor downsizing to retract the tumor from the MRF aiming to achieve a tumor-free resection margin.
When describing involvement of the MRF, you should always describe the location of involvement (e.g., “MRF+ at … o’clock” or “MRF+ at the left anterior side”) Two examples of T3 tumors with invasion of the mesorectal fascia. In the left case the distance between the tumor and the MRF is less than 1 mm at 12 o’clock. In the right case there is more extensive involvement of the MRF between 10 and 12 o’clock Pitfall: circumferential resection margin A
radiology report for T3 tumors should include a description of the
smallest distance between the tumor and the MRF, which is sometimes
alternatively referred to in radiological reports as the ‘circumferential resection margin’ (CRM). This
use of CRM as a synonym for MRF is not fully accurate as the CRM is actually
the margin that the surgeon creates when performing a TME. Ideally, this will
be along the MRF, but the CRM may be smaller when the MRF is breached during
surgery or wider when the TME resection specimen includes additional fat
outside the MRF.
Mesorectal fascia versus Peritoneum:
The
low rectum is totally covered by the mesorectal fascia (green line). In the
mid rectum the mesorectum is covered by the mesorectal fascia on the posterior
and lateral side, but on the anterior side it is covered by the visceral
peritoneum (red line indicating the peritoneal reflection). In the high rectum the peritoneal lining extends from the
anterior to the lateral side (yellow line) and the MRF only lines the dorsal
part of the mesorectum. This
distinction is important because invasion of the MRF constitutes T3 MRF+
disease, while growth into the visceral peritoneum entails a risk for tumor spread
into the peritoneal cavity and is staged as T4a disease.
T4a - Invasion of peritoneum or peritoneal reflection:
The
anterior peritoneal reflection marks the transition between the
non-peritonealized and peritonealized portions of the rectum. 
On sagittal
T2-weighted images the peritoneal reflection can be recognized as a hypointense
V-shaped thin line, sometimes referred to as the ‘seagull sign’. In
males it is located just above the seminal vesicles. In females it is located at the level of the cul-de-sac
(Douglas). Pitfall: Overstaging of upper rectal tumours: In upper rectal tumors there will often be a close margin between the rectum and peritoneum. This does not necessarily mean that we are dealing with a T4a tumor. Tumors should only be classified as cT4a if there is clear tumor extension into or beyond the peritoneum or peritoneal reflection Images The image on the left shows a tumor with a close relation to the peritoneum and the bladder (white arrow). However there is no tumor extension beyond the muscularis propria anteriorly and the peritoneum is therefore not invaded. The image on the right shows definite tumor invasion of the peritoneum (yellow arrow), i.e. a T4a tumor. Pitfall: reporting of MRF versus peritoneal invasion Note
that in anterior tumors, MRF invasion can only occur in tumors below the
peritoneal reflection.
Tumors above the peritoneal reflection that invade the
peritoneum anteriorly (i.e. T4a tumours) are sometimes erroneously reported as
MRF+ tumors, which is not correct. cT4a MRF- The upper image shows a cT4a tumor in the upper rectum above
the level of the peritoneal reflection. There is involvement of the peritoneum (yellow stippled line), but not of the
mesorectal fascia. cT3 MRF+ The lower image shows a cT3 tumor in the low rectum below the
level of the peritoneal reflection. There is involvement of the mesorectum on the anterior side
(green line), but not of the peritoneum. cT4a MRF+ A combination of involvement of the peritoneum and the mesorectal fascia is also possible, like in this case. This is a tumor in the upper rectum with involvement of the peritoneum on the anterior side and involvement of the mesorectal fascia on the posterior side.
T4b – Invasion of surrounding organs or structures:
T4b tumors invade other organs or structures that are situated outside the mesorectum. The beforementioned 2021 consensus panel proposed that T4b stage should include invasion of the structures as mentioned in the table (reference). Though this has been a topic of debate, the consensus panel proposed that T4b invasion should also include invasion of any fat that is situated in another anatomical compartment outside the mesorectum (i.e. beyond the MRF), such as the obturator, parailiac or ischiorectal space. Examples
of T4b disease with respective invasion of the prostate (left) and invasion of
the levator ani (right). Note
Invasion of striated muscles is considered
T4b disease, which includes invasion of the external anal sphincter,
puborectalis and levator ani muscles. This is an example of a cT4b tumor growing beyond the mesorectal compartment into the fat of the obturator space. Enable Scroll

Recognizing T4b invasion:
Tumor invasion is defined a continuation of tumoral signal extending into an adjacent organ or structure, which is often accompanied by as loss of the intervening fat plane . Scroll through the axial images and see how the intermediate signal intensity of the tumor is seen to extend into the posterior wall of the vagina (arrows).
EMVI -Extramural vascular invasion:
Extramural vascular invasion is a risk factor for recurrent disease, metastases and impaired overall survival. EMVI is suspected if we see tumor-signal extending into a vascular structure in close proximity to the tumor, when the vessel is expanded by tumor, or if the tumor infiltrates the vessel borders (illustration). Example of an EMVI+ tumor with tumor signal extending into an adjacent vessel
structure, expanding and disrupting the vessel contour. Pitfall: How to report MRF involvement by nodes, tumor deposits or EMVI? In
current guidelines it is not clearly described how to report MRF involvement by tumor-bearing structures other than the primary tumor. The beforementioned multidisciplinary panel of experts proposed in 2021 that the MRF should be reported as involved in case of a ≤1 mm margin from either the primary tumor, extramural venous invasion or from irregularly enlarged tumor deposits or from irregular lymph nodes. Potentially malignant, enlarged lymph nodes with a
smooth margin and an apparently intact capsule contacting the MRF have
a very low risk to result in margin involvement at histopathology and should
therefore not be considered as MRF+ to avoid overtreatment.
Anal sphincter and pelvic floor involvement:
The anal sphincter is
comprised of three layers: Together with the iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus
muscles, the puborectalis and levator ani muscles form the “pelvic floor ” In
low rectal cancers, the MRI report should describe the relationship of
the tumor to the anal sphincter and pelvic floor to guide surgical and
radiotherapy planning. 
This should include a description of which layers of the
anal sphincter and/or pelvic floor are involved, and whether invasion extends
into the upper, middle or lower thirds of the anal canal. Pitfall anal sphinter and TNM The TNM staging system does not clearly define how invasion of different layers of the anal sphincter and pelvic floor should be taken into account. In the 2021 expert consensus meeting it was proposed to: A shows an example of a cT1-2 low rectal tumor that invades the internal sphincter on the left side (arrow).Remember that the invasion of the internal sphincter does not impact the cT-stage, but should be mentioned explicitly in the MRI report to help guide surgical planning. B is an example of a low rectal tumor that invades the internal and external sphincter on the right side (arrowheads). There is also involvement of the puborectalis and levator ani muscles. Remember that invasion of the external sphincter, puborectalis and levator equals skeletal muscle invasion and should be staged as cT4b disease. Note the normal appearance of the external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles on the left side (green arrow).
N-stage:
Regional lymph node drainage. The lymph nodes in red are all non, regional (M-stage) nodes. In TME only the mesorectal nodes and in high rectal tumors also the rectalis superior and inferior mesenteric nodes are excised.
Lymph Node Map:
The terminology used to describe the various lymph node stations in rectal cancer can be a source of confusion. Regional lymph nodesinclude all nodes that are part of the N-stage: Notice that in standard TME only the mesorectal nodes are excised and in high rectal tumors also the rectalis superior and inferior mesenteric nodes (yellow area). This means that other regional lymph nodes, which are located lateral to the mesorectum like the obturator and internal iliac nodes are not routinely excised. Non-regional lymph nodes(all in red) include all nodes that – when involved – are considered distant nodal metastases and are therefore part of the M-stage: Note As an exception to this rule the AJCC TNM (8th ed.) considers inguinal nodes as regional nodes in case of low rectal tumors extending into the distal anal canal, below the level of the dentate line.

positive they are regarded as metastatic disease. The

main trunk of the internal iliac vessels. The posterior border of the external
iliac compartment is defined by the posterior border of the external iliac

the purple area the superior rectal and inferior mesenteric nodes are located. These nodes are sometimes referred to as “high mesorectal nodes” and are part
of the regional N-stage nodes. The level of the highest suspicious node in
this region should be mentioned in the report, as this will impact the chosen
radiotherapy field.
Mesorectal lymph nodes:
The N-stage in rectal cancer is only based on the number of suspicious regionallymph nodes.
Suspicious non-regional lymph nodes are considered metastatic disease. MRI
like other imaging modalities has a relatively low diagnostic performance to
stage lymph nodes. Whether or not N-stage as determined by imaging should be
taken into account for treatment stratification has been the topic of debate,
though most current guidelines still consider positive N-stage on imaging a
high risk sign, warranting neoadjuvant treatment. Best
results are obtained when applying a combination of nodal size and morphology
to characterize mesorectal lymph nodes. See published guidelines by ESGAR and in the Dutch national guidelines [ref]. Nodes ≥ 9 mm and nodes with mucinous signal characteristics
are always regarded as suspicious. Smaller lymph nodes require additional morphologically
suspicious features (round shape, indistinct border, heterogeneous signal) in
order to be considered as cN+ as detailed in the Table. Note It is important to mention the level of the most proximal suspicious lymph node
especially if there are N+ nodes present high in the mesorectum or in the distal
mesosigmoid, along the superior rectal or inferior mesenteric vessels, as these
nodes can impact the radiotherapy field. The same size + morphology criteria
apply to stage these “high mesorectal” nodes.
Lateral lymph nodes:
Lateral lymph nodes are sometimes referred to as extramesorectal lymph nodes.
These are lymph nodes that are located lateral to the mesorectum and are not routinely removed in standard TME resection.
They need
to be reviewed carefully and mentioned separately in the report. Especially tumors
located below the peritoneal reflection have a tendency to spread to the
internal iliac and obturator compartments.
If pathologic
nodes in these compartments are not additionally treated by lateral nodal
dissection or radiotherapy, they are associated with a higher risk for
recurrence. In
2019, the lateral nodal study consortium proposed a size cut-off of ≥7 mm short axis diameter to stage internal iliac and obturator nodes on MRI and
also showed that – unlike in mesorectal nodes – morphologic features should not
be taken into account (ref). Example
of a pathologic lymph node measuring 9 mm in the left obturator space (arrow). This node
needs to be irradiated or resected separately to avoid recurrence. This
axial T2W-image is of a patient who was treated with a TME. There is a local recurrence of rectal cancer due to an untreated positive lateral lymph node Although not routinely used by all for radiological staging, the 8th
edition of the TNM further divides the N-stage (table). Pitfall: nodes versus tumor deposits Pathologic lymph nodes and tumor deposits can look very similar on imaging and there are  no widely adopted criteria to discriminate the two. Some define tumor deposits as more irregular nodules that are often situated within or along vessels, while pathologic nodes still have a familiar round or oval shape and capsule typical of lymph nodes (ref). These definitions, however, remain to be validated at large scale. Until then, the 2021 consensus panel advised to group nodes and deposits together in the cN-stage. 
A prose description of the size and morphology of the suspicious lesions should be included in the report (ref). Image
This sagittal T2W-image shows a low rectal cancer with multiple irregular nodular lesions in the mesorectal fat on the posterior side. Though one could argue whether these lesions represent tumor deposits or pathologic lymph nodes, they are all considered as part of the N-stage, which was cN2 in this patient. Combined with advanced T-stage (T3c MRF+) this patient was classified as locally advanced and received neoadjuvant chemoradiation for tumor and nodal down-staging.
M-stage:
The
M-stage in rectal cancer is based on the presence of suspicious non-regional lymph node metastases and other distant metastases. Note
that non-regional lymph nodes are together considered as one “organ”.
Restaging after neoadjuvant treatment:

Checklist:
A restaging
report basically uses the same descriptors as for primary staging. In addition to yTNM-staging, it is important to give an overall estimation of the degree of response and classify patients as poor, good or potential complete responders to inform further clinical decision making. In
most cases, a restaging report mainly serves as an up-to-date roadmap for the
surgeon. 
In some cases restaging is
also used to select potential candidates for organ-preservation. In the table the main items and criteria that are specific to
the restaging setting are summarized.
Response assessment:
After
chemo-radiotherapy, rectal tumors typically decrease in size and undergo a
fibrotic transformation which can be observed as a marked decrease in signal
intensity of the tumor bed on T2-weighted images. In a
small minority of cases (<5%) the tumor completely disappears and an
apparently normalized rectal wall re-appears on MRI after CRT. A
restaging MRI report should start with a general description of the degree of
response. The
response can be classified into: Tumor regression grade (TRG)MRI has known difficulties in differentiating between
fibrosis still containing vital tumor cells and mere fibrosis. Nevertheless there are certain patterns that can help
estimate the risk for significant viable tumor within the fibrosis. The
MR tumor regression grade (mrTRG) is an imaging adaptation of similar TRG
systems used at histopathology and can be used to grade the degree of fibrotic
transformation on T2-weighted MRI using a 5-point scale (table)
Diffusion-weighted imaging:
DWI
highlights tissue with a high cellular density in which the extracellular
movement of water is “restricted”. DWI has been shown to be a useful adjunct to T2-weighted MRI
to diagnose the presence of viable residual tumor within the fibrotically
changed tumor bed after CRT [reference]. In case of residual tumor, a high signal can typically be
observed at the inner margin of the fibrosis on high b-value diffusion-weighted
images, with a corresponding low signal on the ADC map. Images
The
images show the primary staging and restaging T2-weighted images after
chemoradiotherapy with predominant fibrosis with minor signal heterogeneity
(TRG 3). The corresponding restaging DWI shows a focal area of high
signal at the inner margin of the fibrosis with corresponding low signal on the
ADC map, indicating restricted diffusion. 
This
was confirmed to be a small tumor remnant (ypT2) at histopathology. Pitfall: staging in case of fibrosisUnfortunately
the overall accuracy of MRI to assess yT-stage, yMRF, yEMVI and sphincter
invasion after CRT is poorer than in the primary staging setting due to the
difficulties of MRI to assess the presence and extent of vital tumour within
the fibrotically changed tumor bed. Assessment of MRF involvement after CRT When a fat plane re-appears between the tumor bed and the MRF after CRT, the risk of persistent MRF
involvement is very small. 
When
there is still diffuse infiltration of the MRF by intermediate tumor signal
after CRT, the risk for tumor invasion at histopathology is high (around
90%). 
The
most difficult cases are those with diffuse fibrotic infiltration of the MRF.
In these cases, the risk for MRF positivity at histopathology
is around 50% [reference]. ImagesPre-CTR there is extensive invasion of the MRF from 4-8 o’clock (arrows). After CRT the tumor has undergone a fibrotic transformation and has retracted from the MRF. A fatplane has appeared with only some minor fibrotic stranding towards the MRF. 
These are signs indicative of a tumor-free MRF at restaging (yMRF-) Example of a patient with several irregularly enlarged cN+ nodes at primary staging. After chemoradiotherapy, most nodes have disappeared and only a small node of < 5 mm remains, indicative of a ycN0 stage. yN-stage The
diagnostic performance of MRI to restage lymph nodes after CRT is better than
for the primary staging of nodes. After CRT, the majority of nodes decrease in
size or completely disappear on MRI. Nodes that remain clearly visible after
CRT are still at risk. Although the optimal size cut-off remains a topic of
debate, a cut-off of ≥5 mm (short axis diameter) has been proposed to diagnose
yN+ nodes after CRT [ref]. For the lateral nodes, the lateral nodal study consortium have
proposed a cut-off of >4 mm (internal iliac) and >6 mm (obturator), but
these criteria are to date considered preliminary and remain to be validated [ref]. Lymph nodes like other lymphoid tissues including the spleen have a dense cellular structure resulting in restricted diffusion and a high signal on DWI. As a result, DWI can be helpful in detecting lymph nodes but is less suitable for lymph node characterization as both benign and metastatic lymph nodes will show high signal. Images
Better visualisation of lymph nodes on DWI compared to corresponding T2WI.
DWI pitfalls:
T2 shine through Diffusion-weighted
images are inherently T2-weighted.
T2 shine through refers to the presence of high signal on
DWI that is not caused by restricted diffusion, but by long T2-relaxation time
(e.g., in fluids).
In rectal DWI this may occur in case of small amounts of
fluid in the rectal lumen, which may mimic tumor in the adjacent rectal wall.
To differentiate between this luminal T2 shine-through and tumor one should refer
to the ADC map where luminal fluids will show a high signal. T2 dark throughAlso called T2 black out, refers to the
markedly low signal observed on the ADC map in areas of dense fibrosis without
vital tumor.
This occurs in tissues with a very short T2-relaxation time (such
as collagen-rich fibrosis, calcified lesions and cortical bone) and will result
in a completely hypointense signal on the ADC map, but also on other series
including the DWI, T2-weighted and T1-weighted sequences.
T2 dark through
should not be mistaken for restricted diffusion suspicious for tumor. Example of shine through of high T2 signal on DWI from fluid in the rectal lumen. 
The ADC map shows an example of T2 dark through with distintly low signal in the fibrotically changed rectal wall. There is no corresponding high signal in the wall on DWI, indicating that there is no actual diffusion restriction. Susceptibility artefacts Abdominal DWI scans are often acquired using echo planar imaging (EPI), which allows fast image acquisition thereby minimizing the risk of motion artefacts.
The main downside of EPI-DWI is that it is highly prone to susceptibility effects, i.e. distortions or artificial pile up of MR signal caused by local field inhomogeneities, especially at higher field strengths. In rectal DWI, these susceptibility effects mainly occur at the interface between soft tissue in the rectal wall or tumor and gas in the lumen. 
While large artefacts will be easy to recognize as artefacts, more subtle ones projecting over the rectal wall may be erroneously interpreted as tumor signal. Susceptibility artefacts in rectal DWI may be avoided by reducing the amount of gas in the rectal lumen or  by using alternative methods of DWI acquisition, such as spin echo techniques,  that are less prone to these susceptibility effects. ImagesThis is a patient with tumor in the right anterolateral rectal wall. Post CRT there is fibrosis visible at the site of the former tumor bed from 9-12 o’clock. The high signal on DWI is located on the contralateral side, outside the tumor bed and corresponds to susceptibility artefacts caused by gas in the rectal lumen. These artefacts should not be mistaken for high signal suspicious of tumor.
MR protocol:
HardwareMRI of rectal cancer may be performed at either 1.5T or 3.0T,
using  phased array external surface coils. Use
of an endorectal coil is not routinely recommended. Patient preparationPatient preparation is not mandatory. 
Use of spasmolytics may be considered to reduce bowel movement artefacts
(particularly in upper rectal tumors that are more prone to these
artefacts). 
Use
of endorectal filling is not routinely recommended since distension of the
rectum and consequent compression of perirectal tissues may interfere with
correct interpretation of the distance between the tumor and mesorectal fascia
. Preparatory
steps to reduce the amount of gas in the rectal lumen may be helpful to avoid
gas-induced susceptibility artifacts on DWI-sequences, although this is mainly
an issue in the restaging setting where DWI plays a more important role. 
This
can be achieved for example by  giving patients a preparatory micro-enema
or a small volume of rectal filling (up to 60 ml). Sagittal series
The sagittal series is used to localize the tumor and to plan the
axial and coronal series. The cranial border of the field of view (FOV) should
be at the level of the sacral promontory and the caudal border below the anal
canal. Axial series
The axial (or oblique-axial) view should be angled perpendicular
to the tumor axis to allow proper assessment of the extension of the tumor
beyond the rectal wall and the distance between the tumor and MRF. Coronal series
The coronal
sequence should be angled parallel to the tumor axis, which is perpendicular to the axial series. In distal tumors near or
involving the anal canal, the coronal sequences should be planned parallel to
the anal canal or an additional coronal plane parallel to the anal canal
should be added to the protocol to properly assess whether and to what extent the
tumor is invading the anal sphincter (right figure). Example of improper angulation. Click to enlarge image Example showing
impact of sequence angulation:In the middle
image the axial view is angled in true axial plane, which is not perpendicular to the tumor axis of this low rectal tumor. 
This resulted in the false impression that the MRF was involved on the anterior
side (red circle). 
In the right image, the axial view is correctly planned
perpendicular to the tumor axis and it was clear that the MRF was not involved
(yellow circle). T2WI
A rectal
MRI protocol should routinely include high resolution 2D T2-weighted sequences
in multiple planes with a slice thickness of ≤3 mm. Although recent technical advances have
improved the quality of 3D T2-weighted sequences, they are not yet commonly
used as a replacement for 2D T2-weighted sequences. The required in plane
resolution is less well documented in guidelines, though a resolution of 0.6 x
0.6 mm or less is generally recommended [ref]. DWI
It is recommended to routinely include a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence. Diffusion weighted imaging can be useful for tumor and lymph node detection in primary staging and are particularly useful for the restaging of tumors after neoadjuvant treatment. 
The DWI protocol should include at least one high b-value of ≥ 800 s/mm2. 
Apparent diffusion coefficient maps should be calculated from the DWI series to be studied visually alongside the DW images (see also section on DWI pitfalls). Images
Example of a patient with a lot of faeces in the rectum. The tumor itself is barely recognizable on the T2-weighted MRI, but easy to locate on DWI. Here are two more examples of patients with very similar semicircular tumors pre- and post-CRT.
On the T2W-images post-CRT both patients show some fibrotic wall thickening in the radiated area, but no obvious solid tumor remnant (yellow arrowheads). On DWI, patient A shows no mass-like diffusion restriction. There is only some shine through of fluid signal in the lumen. In patient B there is focal restricted diffusion at the site of the fibrosis. Patient A was confirmed to be a complete responder at endoscopy and went into a wait-and-see program.
Patient B underwent resection which confirmed a ypT2 tumor remnant. DWI in restaging after chemoradiation Other sequences T1-weighted MRI: non-enhanced T1-weighted sequences  may be useful to help characterize
coincidental findings (e.g. bone lesions, ovarian cysts) but are not mandatory
for staging . T1-weighted sequences with an extended field of view can also be
used to cover all relevant lymph node stations within a relatively short
acquisition time. Intravenous contrast: steady-state gadolinium enhanced imaging does not
improve diagnostic accuracy for clinical staging and is not routinely
recommended. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is not routinely recommended for
clinical staging. Fatsuppression: fatsuppressed sequences are not required for staging.
T2-weighted fatsuppressed images may be of added benefit for patients with
concommittant perianal fistulas or abscesses.
Surgery:
This is an
umbrella term for various minimally invasive techniques to excise rectal tumors
endoscopically, through the anus. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and
endoscopic submucosal resection (ESD) are superficial excision techniques used
for non-cancerous polyps and T1a and T1b tumors. 
Transanal minimally invasive
surgery (TAMIS) or transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM; a very similar but
older technique) is a full thickness endoscopic resection of all layers of the
bowel wall that can be applied for T1 (and some small T2) tumors.
Organ-preservation:
There
is a growing tendency to consider minimally invasive or non-surgical treatment
alternatives in tumors that show a complete or near-complete response after
neoadjuvant treatment. These alternatives
include the “watch-and-wait”
strategy, where patients with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant
treatment are deferred from surgery and closely monitored, and local excision
or local radiotherapy techniques for patients with small tumor
remnants. These developments have urged the need for a more accurate radiological
assessment after neoadjuvant treatment and MRI – combined with endoscopy and
clinical examination – plays an important role in the selection and monitoring
of these patients.

Common Liver Tumors:
Richard Baron
Radiology department of the University of Chicago:
Publicationdate 2006-07-15 This article is based on a presentation given by Richard Baron and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. Richard Baron is Chair of Radiology at the University of Chicago and well known for his work on hepatobiliary diseases. He has been president of the Society of Computed Body Tomography and Magnetic Resonance. In Part I a basic concept is given on how to detect and characterize livermasses with CT. In Part II the imaging features of the most common hepatic tumors are presented.
Hemangioma:
Hemangioma is the most common benign liver tumor. It is composed of multiple vascular channels lined by endothelial cells. In 60% of cases more than one hemangioma is present. The size varies from a few millimeters to more than 10 cm (giant hemangiomas). Calcification is rare and seen in less than 10%, usually in the central scar of giant hemangioma. Typical hemangioma matches the bloodpool in every phase. CT will show hemangiomas as sharply defined masses with the same density as the vessels on NECT and CECT. The enhancement pattern is characterized by sequential contrast opacification beginning at the periphery as one or more nodular areas of enhancement. All these areas of enhancement must have the same density as the bloodpool. This means that in the arterial phase the areas of enhancement must have almost the density of the aorta, while in the portal venous phase the enhancement must be of the same density as the portal vein. Even on delayed images the density of a hemangioma must be of the same density as the vessels. Finally most hemangiomas show complete fill in with contrast. Flash filling hemangioma in unenhanced, arterial and portal venous phase. Notice it matches the bloodpool. Small hemangiomas may show fast homogeneous enhancement ('flash filling'). Small HCC and hypervascular metastases may mimic small hemangiomas because they all show homogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase. By looking at the other phases to see if the enhancing areas match the bloodpool, it is usually possible to differentiate these lesions. Giant hemangiomas with scar-tissue. Notice that the enhancement matches the bloodpool in all phases. Central scar is hypodens on NECT and stays hypodens. Large hemangiomas can have an atypical appearance. Complete fill in is sometimes prevented by central fibrous scarring. These lesions need to be differentiated from other lesions with a scar like FLC, FNH and Cholangiocarcinoma. Again looking at the bloodpool will help you. On the left two large hemangiomas. Notice that the enhancing parts of the lesion follow the bloodpool in every phase, but centrally there is scar tissue that does not enhance. LEFT: rimenhancement in breast metastasis. RIGHT: nodular discontinuous enhancement in hemangioma. Peripheral enhancement The enhancement of a hemangioma starts peripheral . It is nodular or globular and discontinuous. Rim enhancement is continuous peripheral enhancement and is never hemangioma. Rim enhancement is a feature of malignant lesions, especially metastases. Liver lesion showing nodular enhancement, progressive fill in and delayed enhancement. Progressive fill in First look at the images on the left and describe what you see. Then continue. The lesion definitely has some features of a hemangioma like nodular enhancement in the arterial phase and progressive fill in in the portal venous and equilibrium phase. In the portal venous phase however, the enhancement is not as bright as the enhancement of the portal vein. The conclusion must be, that this lesion does not match bloodpool in all phases, so it cannot be a hemangioma. So progressive fill in is a non-specific feature, that can be seen in many other lesions like metastases or primary liver tumors like cholangiocarcinoma. The delayed enhancement in this lesion is due to fibrotic tissue in a cholangiocarcinoma and is a specific feature of these tumors. LEFT: Classic US appearance of a hemangioma.RIGHT: Also a hemangioma but now in a hyperechoic liver, so the lesion is relatively hypoechoic. Notice increased sound transmission. Ultrasound Most hemangiomas are detected with US. If you had to pick one word to characterize a hemangioma on US, you would probably say 'hyperechoic'.
You have to realize however, that this simply means that the lesion is hyperechoic to normal liver. If the liver is hyperechoic due to steatosis, the hemangioma can appear hypoechoic (figure). Another important feature of hemangiomas is the increased sound transmission. This is because the lesion is made of these channels containing blood. Differential diagnosis Hemangiomas must be differentiated from other lesions that are hypervascular or lesions that show peripheral enhancement and progressive fill in.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):
HCC is the most frequent abdominal malignancy worldwide and is especially common in Asia and mediterrean countries. HCC may be solitary, multifocal or diffusely infiltrating. HCC consists of abnormal hepatocytes arranged in a typical trabecular pattern. Larger HCC lesions typically have a mosaic appearance due to hemorrhage and fibrosis. In patients with cirrhosis or with hepatitis B/C our major concern is HCC, since 85% of HCC occur in these patients. If you take a cohort of patients with hepatitis C and you follow them for 10 years, 50% of them will have end stage liver disease and 25% will have HCC. Small HCC seen only in arterial phase in a patient with cirrhosis.
Early appearance of HCC:
It is important to separate the early appearance from the late appearance of HCC. Nowadays we encounter very small HCC's in patients, that we screen for HCC (figure). These are small lesions that transiently enhance homogeneously. You will only see them in the arterial phase. Sometimes there is rim enhancement and you might mistake them for a hemangioma. Always look how they present in the other phases and compare with the bloodpool and remember that rim enhancement is never hemangioma. These early HCC's are very different from the large ones that we see in the non-cirrhotic patients. Large HCC with mozaik pattern in a non cirrhotic patient.
Late appearance of HCC:
HCC is a silent tumor, so if patients do not have cirrhosis or hepatitis C, you will discover them in a late stage. They tend to be very large with a mozaic pattern, a capsule, hemorrhage, necrosis and fat evolution. HCC becomes isodense or hypodense to liver in the portal venous phase due to fast wash-out.
On delayed images the capsule and sometimes septa demonstrate prolonged enhancement. LEFT: Diffusely enhancing tumor thrombus in HCC with portal vein invasion.RIGHT: Tumor thrombus with vessels within the thrombus. HCC and Portal Vein thrombosis Many patients with cirrhosis have portal venous thrombosis and many patients with HCC have thrombosis. These are two common findings and they can be coincidental. It is very important to make the distinction between just thrombus and tumor thrombus. First, if you have a malignant thrombus in the portal vein, it will always enhance and you'll see it best in arterial phase. Secondly, if you have a malignant thrombus in the portal vein, it will increase the diameter of the vessel. Sometimes a tumor thrombus may present with neovascularity within the thrombus (figure).
Differential diagnosis:
Metastases can look like almost any lesion that occurs in the liver. 
Hypervascular metastases have to be differentiated from other hypervascular tumors that can be multifocal like hemangiomas, FNH, adenoma and HCC. 
Hypovascular metastases have to be differentiated from focal fatty infiltration, abscesses, atypical hypovascular HCC and cholangiocarcinoma. Metastasis difficult to detect on CECT in portal venous phase (left). Better seen on NECT. Metastases in fatty liver Focal fatty sparing in a diffusely fatty liver or foci of focal fatty infiltration can simulate metastases. However on nonenhanced scans these regions of fat variation tend to be nonspherical and geographic, with no mass effect or distortion of the local vessels. On the other hand a fatty liver can also obscure metastases. On a contrast enhanced CT hypovascular lesions can be obscured if the liver itself is lower in density due to fat deposition. On a NECT these lesions usually are better depicted (figure). Steatosis of right liver lobe. No lesions detectable. On US multiple lesions in the same region. If a patient is known to have a fatty liver, it is better to do an MRI or ultrasound for the detection of livermetastases. On the left a patient with fatty infiltration of large parts of the liver.
No metastases were seen, but on an ultrasound of the same region multiple metastases were detected.
Hepatic Adenoma:
Hepatocellular adenomas are large, well circumscribed encapsulated tumors.
They consist of sheets of hepatocytes without bile ducts or portal areas. 80% of adenomas are solitary and 20% are multiple. Adenomas typically measure 8-15 cm and consist of sheets of well-differentiated hepatocytes. Adenomas are prone to central necrosis and hemorrhage because the vascular supply is limited to the surface of the tumor. The pathogenesis is believed to be related to a generalized vascular ectasia that develops due to exposure of the liver to oral contraceptives and related synthetic steroids. In young woman using contraceptives an adenoma is the most frequent hepatic tumor. CT will show most adenomas as a lesion with homogeneous enhancement in the late arterial phase, that will stay isodense to the liver in later phases. Unfortunately, this homogeneous enhancement in the late arterial phase is not specific to adenomas, since small HCC's and hemangiomas as well as hypervascular metastases and FNH can demonstrate similar enhancement in the arterial phase. Malignant lesions however have a tendency to loose their contrast faster than the surrounding liver, so they may become relatively hypodense in later phases. The finding of hemorrhage as an area of high attenuation can be seen in as many as 40% of adenomas. This is however also a feature of HCC and large hemangiomas. Fat deposition within adenomas is identified on CT in only approximately 7% of patients and is better depicted on MRI. Typically adenomas have well-defined borders and do not have lobulated contours. A low-attenuation pseudocapsule can be seen in as many as 30% of patients. This capsule will only show enhancement on delayed scans. Coarse calcifications are seen in only 5% of patients. On the left an adenoma with fat deposition and a capsule. MRI usually is more sensitive in detecting fat and hemorrhage. Chemical-shift imaging showing loss of signal on out-of-phase images can confirm the presence of fat. HCC is known to contain fat in as many as 40% of lesions, therefore the presence of fat does not help differentiate the lesions. Adenoma with hemorrhage. Adenomas may rupture and bleed, causing right upper quadrant pain. The two most common liver lesions causing hepatic hemorrhage are HA and HCC. Although adenomas are benign lesions, they can undergo malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although malignant transformation is rare, for this reason, surgical resection is advocated in most patients with presumed adenomas. Enhancing adenoma with fat in the center Significant overlap is noted between the CT appearances of adenoma, HCC, FNH, and hypervascular metastases, making a definitive diagnosis based on CT imaging criteria alone difficult and often not possible. Clinical correlation in such cases is most helpful. In otherwise healthy young women using oral contraceptives, adenoma is favored. Patients with glycogen storage disease, hemochromatosis, acromegaly, or males on anabolic steroids also are more prone to developing hepatic adenomas.
A history of cirrhosis and high AFP levels favor HCC. A history of a primary hypervascular tumor favors metastases. Adenoma showing capsule in delayed phase As a result of the risk of intraperitoneal hemorrhage and the rare occurrence of malignant transformation to HCC, surgical resection has been advocated in most patients with presumed HA. The risk of significant bleeding from the tumor is as high as 30%. The exact risk of malignant transformation is unknown. Some advocate surgical resection only when tumors are larger than 5 cm or when AFP levels are elevated, since these two findings are associated with higher risk of malignancy. The value of percutaneous fine needle biopsy for the diagnosis of HA is controversial for two reasons. First, histologic studies may lead to misdiagnosis when differentiating HA from FNH. In addition, a considerable risk of hemorrhage exists when biopsy is performed on these hypervascular tumors. Adenomas may diminish after oral contraceptives are discontinued, but this does not lower the risk of malignant transformation. When a definitive diagnosis of FNH can be made using imaging studies, surgery can be avoided and lesions can be observed safely using radiologic studies. However, if HA or HCC remains in the differential diagnosis, surgery usually is indicated.
Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH):
FNH is the second most common tumor of the liver. FNH is not a true neoplasm. It is believed to represent a hyperplastic response to increased blood flow in an intrahepatic arteriovenous malformation. All the normal constituents of the liver are present but in an abnormally organized pattern. US will show a FNH as a non specific ill-defined lesion. The central scar may be detected as a hyperechoic area, but often cannot be differentiated. With color doppler sometimes the vessels can be seen within the scar. CT will show FNH as a vascular tumor, that will be hyperdens in the arterial phase, except for the central scar. On the left a typical FNH with a central scar that is hypodens in the portal venous phase and hyperdens in the equilibrium phase. MRI will show a hypointense central scar on T1-weighted images. On T2-weighted images the scar appears as hyperintense in 80% of patients, which is very typical.
However in 20% of patients the scar is hypointense. Gadolineum enhanced MRI will reveal similar enhancement patterns as on CECT. FNH seen as hypervascular lesion in the late arterial phase and isodense to normal liver in the portal venous phase. No scar was seen. The diagnosis of FNH is based on the demonstration of a central scar and a homogeneous enhancement. However, a typical central scar may not be visible in as many as 20% of patients (figure). Moreover a central scar may be found in some patients with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The key to the diagnosis in the lesion on the left is the fact that it is isoattenuating to normal liver in the portal venous phase and stays that way without a wash out on the delayed phase (not shown). This could also be an adenoma, but HCC would be unlikely because they show a fast wash out. T2WI, T1WI without Gadolineum and a delayed phase after Gadolineum. If you look at the images on the left and just would consider the T2W-images, what could be the cause of the central area of high signal? The most common cause would be central necrosis in a tumor. However if you look at the delayed phase, you will notice that this area enhances. So this is fibrotic tissue and the diagnosis is FNH. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) has a dark scar on T2WI and FNH has a brigth scar on T2WI in 80% of the cases. This means that at times the differential between FNH and FLC will not be possible.
Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC):
FLC is an uncommon malignant hepatocellular tumor, but less aggressive than HCC. FLC characteristically manifests as a 10-20 cm large hepatic mass in adolescents or young adults. The typical risk factors for HCC such as cirrhosis, elevated alphafetoprotein, viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse are absent. FLC characteristically appears as a lobulated heterogeneous mass with a central scar in an otherwise normal liver. Calcifications occur in 30-60% of fibrolamellar tumors. LEFT: FLC in late arterial phase: central calcification and heterogenous enhancement in a lamellar pattern. RIGHT: venous phase with hypodense central scar. Imaging features of FLC overlap with those of other scar-producing lesions including FNH, HCC, Hemangioma and Cholangiocarcinoma. FNH, in particular, may simulate FLC, since both have similar demographic and clinical characteristics. In contrast to FNH the central scar in FLC will usually be hypointense on T2WI and will less often show delayed enhancement. While FNH is always very homogeneous, FLC is usually heterogeneous following contrast administration. On the left pathologic specimens of FLC and FNH. At first glance they look very similar. However when you look carefully you will notice the lamellar and heterogenous structure of FLC compared to the homogeneous appearance of FNH. On non enhanced images a FLC usually presents as a big mass with central calcifications.
Cholangiocarcinoma:
Cholangiocarcinoma usually presents as a mass of 5-20cm. In 65% there are satellite nodules and in some cases punctate calcifications are seen. The diagnosis of a cholangiocarcinoma is often difficult to make for a radiologist and even a pathologist. That is because cholangiocarcinoma has a varied morphology and histology. It can be a constricting or an expanding lesion, because it can have a fibrous or a glandular stroma. It can be located anywhere in the intrahepatic bile ducts or common bile duct. Cholangiocarcinoma: Non enhanced, arterial, portal venous and equilibrium phase. First look at the images on the left and try to find good descriptive terms for what you see. Then continue. The lesion on the left has the folowing characteristics: The finding of an infiltrating mass with capsular retraction and delayed persistent enhancement is very typical for a cholangiocarcinoma. Infiltrative cholangiocarcinoma does not cause mass effect, because when the stroma matures, the fibrous tissue will contract and cause retraction of the liver capsule. There are not many tumors that cause retraction of the liver capsule, since most tumors will bulge. The most common tumor that causes retraction besides cholangiocarcinoma is metastatic breast cancer. This will give a pseudo-cirrhosis appearance. Another cause of local retraction is atrophy due to biliary obstruction or chronic portal venous obstruction. The case on the left demonstrates how difficult the detection of ta cholangiocarcinoma can be. Only on the delayed images at 8-10 minutes after contrast injection a relative hyperdense lesion is seen. This is the fibrous component of the tumor. Some cholangiocarcinomas have a glandular stroma.
Hepatic Metastases:
The liver is the most common site of metastases. The most common organs of origin are: colon, stomach, pancreas, breast and lung. Most liver metastases are multiple, involving both lobes in 77% of patients and only in 10% of cases there is a solitary metastasis. Hypovascular metastases are the most common and occur in GI tract, lung, breast and head/neck tumors. They are detected as hypodense lesions in the late portal venous phase. In this phase the attenuation of the normal liver parenchyma increases, revealing the relatively hypoattenuating metastases, sometimes with peripheral enhancement. The rim enhancement that occurs represents viable tumor peripherally, which appears against a less viable or necrotic center (figure). Hypervascular metastases are less common and are seen in renal cell carcinoma, insulinomas, carcinoid, sarcomas, melanoma and breast cancer. They are best seen in the late arterial phase at 35 sec after contrast injection. Although breast cancer metastases can be hypervascular, it was shown that routine use of adding arterial phase imaging, did not show any advantage. Calcified liver metastases are uncommon. Calcification can be seen in metastases of colon, stomach, breast, endocrine pancreatic ca, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma and melanoma. When calcified liver metastases are revealed by CT in a patient with unknown primary tumor, colon cancer will be the most likely cause. Cystic liver metastases are seen in mucinous ovarian ca, colon ca, sarcoma, melanoma, lung ca and carcinoid tumor. On MRI metastases are usually hypointense on T1WI and hyperintense on T2WI. Peritumoral edema makes lesions appear larger on T2WI and is very suggestive of a malignant mass. On dynamic contrast-enhanced MRi the characteristics of metastases are the same as for CECT. Calcified metastasis in a patient with colon cancer. Ultrasound findings At US, metastases may appear cystic,hypoechoic, isoechoic or hyperechoic. Bull's eye or target lesions is a common presentation of metastases. In these metastases the halo is most probably related to a combination of compressed normal hepatic parenchyma around the mass and a zone of cancer cell proliferation. This pattern suggests aggressive behavior and is seen in bronchogenic, breast and colon carcinoma, . However, this pattern is not specific for metastases as it can also be seen in primary malignant liver neoplasms (eg, HCC) and benign liver neoplasms (eg, adenoma in glycogen storage disease). A similar appearance has been described with liver abscesses.
Calcified metastases may shadow when they are densely echogenic (figure). This pattern is commonly seen in colorectal cancer.
Liver abces:
The presentation of liver abcesses is very much dependend on the way the bacteria have entered the liver. There are four routes for bacteria to get into the liver. The common route is through the portal vein as a result of abdominal infection. The bacteria enter through the slow flow portal system and they are layered within the vessel. The bacteria will fall down into the dependent portion of the right lobe. In sepsis the spread will be via the arterial system as in patients with endocarditis and there will be multiple abscesses spread out through the periphery of the liver. The biliary route is often the result of biliary manipulation as in ERCP. It is usually central in location and then spreads out. Finally there is a direct route as in penetrating injury or direct spread of cholecystitis into the liver. Liver abcess in a patient with diverticulitis. First look at the images on the left and try to find good descriptive terms for what you see. Then continue. If you would describe the image on the left, you would use terms as: So these findings suggest liverabscesses especially because it's clustered. Only when you have a population with livertransplants, bilomas in an infarcted area would look the same. If it wasn't clustered than any cystic tumor could look like this. It is very important to make the diagnosis of liver absces because it is a benign disease that kills and the radiologist may be the first to raise the suspicion. LEFT: Small cyst-like lesion after recent ERCPRIGHT: 3 weeks later a large absces had developed. Whenever you see a small cyst-like lesion in a patient who recently underwent an ERCP, be very carefull to assume it is just a simple cyst. Biliary abscesses start small but can progress rapidly. The figure on the left shows such a case. Within 3 weeks the small lesion in the left liver lobe progressed to this huge abces. So any cystic structure near the biliary tract in a patient, who recently has undergone a biliary procedure, is suspicious of a liver abces.
BTS guideline of pulmonary nodules:

Guideline of the British Thoracic Society:
Onno Mets and Robin Smithuis
the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam and the Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2017-10-01 This article presents the 2015 guidelines of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) for the management of pulmonary nodules [1]. Important issues in these guidelines are: The same approach for nodules detected incidentally as for those detected through screening. Introduction
Introduction:

BTS guideline:
The figure shows a comprehensive version of the BTS-algorithms. No follow up for nodules < 5mm and typically benign lesions with benign calcifications like hamartomas and perifissural nodules.
* Step 2 Only lesions of 5mm or more require follow up. Divide lesions into solid and subsolid (groundglass or part solid)
* Step 3 Use the Brock Model application to assess the risk of malignancy for solid lesions >8mm and subsolid lesions that are stable during 3 month follow up.
* Step 4 Use the Herder model when you perform a PET-CT. Follow-up takes 1 year if volumetry is used, while manual 2D-measurements warrant a 2 year follow-up period. Nodules that show volume change less than 25% should be regarded stable and discharged after the indicated follow-up interval. Consider discharge only if VDT >600 days is calculated using volumetry. When there is previous imaging, determine the risk of lung cancer based on the volume doubling time. Example 1 A solitary non-spiculated solid nodule of 7 mm (162 mm3) is shown in the RLL of a 55 year old male without a positive family history, but with some emphysema. Follow-up showed long term stability with 7 mm (146 mm3) at 12 months. Patient was discharged from further CT surveillance. Example 2 A solitary non-spiculated solid nodule of 9 mm (362 mm3) is shown in the LLL of a 75 year old female without a positive family history or emphysema. Risk prediction by the Brock model equalled 6.3%, indicating surveillance with CT at 3 months. This showed borderline stability, but CT at 12 months showed evident growth with a VDT <400 days. Wedge resection after wire-localization was performed, diagnosing a pulmonary carcinoid.
BTS Pulmonary Nodule Risk Prediction Calculator:
Click here to use the calculator for the Brock model, Herder model and the volume doubling time calculator after checking the box to accept the conditions of use. With this calculator you can calculate: You can also download the calculator-app on your iPhone or Android phone. Click here to see the app in the App Store. The BTS guidelines allow both measurements obtained using a 2D caliper technique and 3D nodule volumetry. Note that the 2D measurement is the single maximal diameter and not the average of short- and long-axis diameters, as in the Fleischner method. In case of multiple pulmonary nodules, the risk assessment and follow-up strategy is based on the largest nodule. Nodule growth is defined as an volume increase ≥25%. When the volume increase is less than 25%, the lesion is called stable.
Brock Model:
McWilliams and colleagues developed the Brock model for pulmonary nodule malignancy risk prediction [2]. Use the app to fill in the nodule and patient characteristics and it will calculate the malignancy risk. Here we see an example of a 45 year old woman with an 8 mm solid nodule not located in the upper lobe and without spiculation. There is no family history of lung cancer and there is no emphysema. The app calculates a malignancy risk of 1.9%. Here another example of a 65 year old man with an 26 mm solid nodule located in the upper lobe with spiculation. There is a family history of lung cancer and there is emphysema. The app calculates a malignancy risk of 67.7%.
Herder model:
The BTS guideline applies the Herder model to reassess the malignancy risk in nodules that are evaluated with PET-CT after a prior increased risk for malignancy, defined as a Brock score ≥10%. It calculates the risk that a nodule will be diagnosed as cancer using : age, smoking status, history of extra-thoracic cancer
* Nodule characteristics: size, upper lobe location, spiculation.
* FDG-avidity: no - faint - moderate - intense. This model showed excellent performance [3], although the performance is limited for subcentimeter nodules due to PET-CT resolution. An example of the Herder model in the app is seen here. It is the same 65-year old man as in the example of the Brock model. Notice that the probability of lung cancer dropped from 67.7% to 10.4% based on the fact that there was no FDG-uptake in the lesion.

Characterization of Adrenal lesions:
Nanda Krak and Robin Smithuis
Radiology Department of Waikato Hospital, Hamilton, New Zealand and Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2019-03-26 Adrenal lesions are very common. Many of these lesions are incidentally discovered and called incidentalomas. An adrenal incidentaloma is defined as a mass > 1 cm that is detected on imaging exams not performed for suspected adrenal disease. Most of these incidentalomas are benign non-functioning adenomas even in patients with a known malignancy. In this article we will discuss the evaluation and management of adrenal masses by dividing them into: Indeterminate lesions > 4 cm Systematic Approach
Systematic Approach:
Adrenal incidentalomas are common and seen in about 3% of abdominal CT's, increasing up to 10% in elderly patients [1,2,3]. The issue is to differentiate benign adrenal tumors from metastases or primary malignant masses without unnecessarily exposing the majority of patients to the burden of clinical workup, interventions and imaging follow-up. First, determine whether a lesion has typically benign or indeterminate imaging features. If it is indeterminate, do a washout-CT or an MRI to see whether it is a lipid-poor adenoma. If it is not an adenoma, then you have to choose between follow up, PET-CT, biopsy or resection. When an adrenal incidentaloma is detected, use the following steps: This includes lesions that show long-term stability in comparison to prior imaging.
2. If the lesion is indeterminate and 1-4 cm in diameter: We will now discuss each of these possibilities.
Typically Benign lesions:
Many adrenal lesions can be categorized as typically benign and need no follow up (table): 'No enhancement' is defined as less than 10HU difference between the unenhanced and enhanced CT. Here some examples of typically benign lesions. Lipid-rich adenoma 70% of adenomas contain high intracellular fat and will be of low attenuation on unenhanced CT [4,5]. A density equal to or below 10 HU is considered diagnostic of a lipid-rich adenomas. Using a safe threshold value of 10HU on a native CT scan results in a sensitivity of 70-79% and a high specificity of 96-98% for the diagnosis of an adenoma [5-7]. Lipid-poor adenoma 30% of adrenal adenomas do not contain enough intracellular lipid to have a density of less than 10 HU and cannot be differentiated from non-adenomas on an unenhanced CT. These adenomas are called lipid-poor. They can be diagnosed with dedicated adrenal-CT to look for fast wash-out. These lipid-poor adenomas will be discussed in the chapter on indeterminate lesions. The images show bilateral adrenal incidentalomas found in a 64-year old patient scanned for analysis of an abdominal aneurysm. The scan in the arterial phase shows bilateral lesions with a density of 50 HU. On the non-enhanced CT performed a few days later, the density in both adrenal glands was less than 10 HU, proving these to be lipid-rich adenomas. Cyst An uncomplicated cyst is a well-defined lesion of water density that does not enhance. A cyst has a thin wall and may have thin septa. It may be an endothelial cyst or a pseudocyst, which are the most common, or a true epithelial or parasitic cyst (both rare) [5]. Pseudocysts may have thicker walls. Hemorrhage or debris may cause increased internal attenuation. Both benign and malignant tumors may show cystic degeneration and necrosis. In those cases density measurements are unreliable. Features of an underlying tumor may be an irregular thick wall of 5 mm or more and mural, septal or solid enhancement [5]. Lesions with benign calcifications Lesions with benign calcifications Coarse rounded, peripheral or septal calcifications are typically benign and may be seen in: Bilateral calcifications also suggest a benign origin. Punctate, dystrophic and irregular calcifiations are not typically benign and can be seen in: Myelolipoma Myelolipomas are benign tumors composed of bone marrow elements. Usually they are easy to recognize on CT or MR because they contain areas of macroscopic fat. Calcifications are seen in 24% of cases. The adrenal mass seen here on CT contains macroscopic fat, which is specific for the diagnosis myelolipoma. On the right a different case with high SI on T1W-image indicating macroscopic fat in a myelolipoma. CT image of another adrenal mass mainly composed of macroscopic fat. Diagnosis: myelolipoma.
Indeterminate lesions 1-4 cm:
Many adrenal lesions cannot be confidently diagnosed as either lipid-rich adenomas or another benign entity because the density is too high on the unenhanced CT or because there is only an enhanced CT to start with. These lesions are called indeterminate. These include the 30% of adenomas that are lipid-poor. In order to find out if a lesion is a lipid-poor adenoma you can do a CT washout scan and look for rapid wash-out, or an MRI and look for signal drop on the out-of-phase scan.
Adrenal Washout:
Adenomas, both lipid-rich and lipid-poor, rapidly wash out contrast. Non-adenomas, for instance metastases, generally enhance rapidly, but take longer to washout. Absolute washoutA dedicated adrenal washout CT protocol consists of a non-contrast, a contrast -enhanced scan with a delay of 60-90 sec and a delayed scan at 15 minutes. The ROI should encompass at least 2/3 of the lesion to ensure a representable assessment. Absolute enhancement wash out ⩾ 60% is proof of an adenoma [5,6,8]. Relative washout If an adrenal lesion is discovered on an enhanced scan while the patient is still on the table, then a second scan of the adrenals at 15 minutes after contrast injection can be made and the relative washout can be calculated. Relative enhancement wash out ⩾ 40% is proof of an adenoma [5,6,8]. Adrenal washout pitfallsImportant exceptions to the washout rule are caused by tumors that show absolute and relative washout percentages within the adenoma-range, in decreasing order of occurence:
Washout Calculator:
Click here to go to the Adrenal Characterization Calculator.
Lipid-poor adenomas:
The images show an indeterminate lesion on the nonenhanced CT (density 24 HU). The absolute washout in this patient is 62%. This means that the lesion is a lipid-poor adenoma. Usually adenomas show different enhancement compared to malignant lesions. On an enhanced CT at 60 sec most adenomas show mild enhancement, while malignant tumors and pheochromocytomas show strong enhancement. There is however too much overlap in enhancement to allow accurate differentiation between these lesions and that is why we need a wash-out CT scan.
MRI Out-of-phase imaging:
Lipid-poor adenomas can also be diagnosed with out-of-phase imaging. They contain enough microscopic fat to cause a signal drop on out-of-phase imaging compared to in-phase imaging due to the chemical shift artefact. These images are of a 65- year-old female patient with an incidental discovery of a right adrenal mass on an abdominal ultrasound performed for renal stones. The presence of microscopic fat is demonstrated by the signal drop on the opposed-phase image. The patient was followed for 2 years, because the lesion is slightly inhomogeneous and measures 5.2 cm. The lesion did not change in size and was not hormonally active. It was diagnosed as a lipid-poor adenoma. MRI performed for a left adrenal incidentaloma discovered on a non-contrast and arterial phase CT scan in a 61-year old male patient with an abdominal aneurysm. On the non-contrast CT density was 18 HU. T1 out-of phase image shows subtle inhomogeneous signal drop compared to in-phase. Note that the fat-suppressed T1 does not help in the detection of microscopic intracellular fat. Continue with next images. The subtle central hyperintensity on the T1 fat sat is also hyperintense on the T2-weighted images and doesn't enhance on the post-contrast image. After comparison with prior CT images from years before, the lesion turned out to be a slowly growing adenoma with recent internal hemorrhage.
Indeterminate lesions > 4 cm:
The maximum diameter of the adrenal mass is predictive of malignancy. In particular, lesions > 4 cm are more likely to be either metastases or adrenocortical carcinomas. Adrenal mass size is important for two more reasons. The overall prognosis is better for small adrenocortical carcinomas and smaller tumors are easier to resect by minimally invasive surgical techniques. Therefore, the recommendation for an indeterminate adrenal mass > 4 cm in size and no history of cancer is surgical resection -in most cases without biopsy - in order to timely treat a possible primary adrenal cortical carcinoma [3,9]. The next cases are examples of indeterminate lesions > 4 cm. All were incidentally discovered in patients without a history of cancer. All diagnoses were histologically proven and showed a wide variety of both benign and malignant tumors. Metastasis of an adenocarcinoma The image shows a heterogeneous ill-defined mass larger than 4 cm. There is a hypo-enhancing center, which is probably the result of central necrosis. In this particular case a biopsy was performed and revealed an adenocarcinoma, probably from primary lung carcinoma. Surprisingly, extensive imaging analysis, including FDG PET-CT, did not detect a primary tumor, however. Adrenocortical carcinoma The image shows a 67 mm heterogeneously enhancing relatively well defined lesion. This proved to be an adrenocortical carcinoma, after resection. Adrenal leiomyoma The image shows a large indeterminate lesion with different densities and a partly calcified rim. Biopsy revealed an adrenal leiomyoma. The lesion was resected. Pheochromocytoma This is a heterogeneously enhancing, relatively well-defined indeterminate lesion. It proved to be a pheochromocytoma. Atypical adenoma A 7cm hyperenhancing adrenal lesion with small cystic spots. The lesion was resected because of its large size and indeterminate imaging features. This proved to be an adenoma.
Specific Adrenal tumors:
Pheochromocytomas: strong enhancement in all 4 cases, even in the smaller tumors
Pheochromocytomas:
Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that originate in the adrenal medulla. Usually, tumors are larger than 3 cm when found. Nonfunctioning tumors are typically larger than functioning tumors. A typical pheochromocytoma will have an unenhanced density >10 HU, or higher in case of hemorrhage. They are highly vascular, resulting in strong enhancement, but in contrast to adenomas they usually have delayed washout [4,5]. Pheochromocytoma with small cyst In 10% pheochromocytomas have calcifications and they frequently have multiple cysts (yellow arrows). This image shows another pheochromocytoma with multiple cysts. Larger tumors are prone to hemorrhage and necrosis, even when they are benign. Pheochromocytomas are nicknamed "imaging chameleons" because many imaging features overlap with other tumors [5]. The so called classic "light bulb sign", which is homogeneous high signal intensity on T2W-images is seen in 65% of cases [4]. Imaging pitfalls Because of these pitfalls diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is based on a combination of imaging features and is often supplemented by nuclear medicine imaging findings and biochemical confirmation. 10% tumor? Pheochromocytomas have been called the "10% tumor" because it was considered that 10% were malignant, 10% bilateral, 10% familial, 10 % extra-adrenal and 10% occurred in children. It has now become clear, however, that actually more than 30% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are inherited [18]. Moreover, the percentage of tumors that are bilateral, extra-adrenal, pediatric or malignant differ with each specific hereditary syndrome [18]. Associated familial syndromes are multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type IIA/B, von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type I, familial paragangliomas caused by SDH-gene mutations, Sturge-Weber syndrome and Carney triad [5, 18]. 10 - 49% of pheochromocytomas are incidentally discovered in asymptomatic patients. The radiologist should therefore have a low threshold in considering the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma. The biochemical diagnosis is made by measurement of plasma free or urinary fractionated metanephrines[2,18]. Unnecessary and potentially dangerous biopsy has to be avoided. Myelolipomas
Myelolipomas:
Adrenal myelolipomas are benign, relatively rare (0,08-0,2%) tumors that contain variable amounts of bone marrow elements and mature fat. Myelolipomas are usually asymptomatic, unless they are very large (due to mass effect) or bleed [5]. The presence of macroscopic fat makes them easy to recognize on CT or MRI. Attenuation on nonenhanced CT will be well below 0 HU. At MR imaging the fatty portions will be hyperintense on non fat-saturated T1-weighted images and show signal dropout on fat-saturated T1 or T2-weighted images. Calcifications are seen in approximately 24% of cases. Axial and coronal image showing a large right myelolipoma with bleeding. The image on the right is a follow-up scan.
Cysts:
Here a small cyst is seen on CT and on a T2W-image. Images show unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT of a cyst. The cyst is thin-walled, homogeneous and does not show any enhancement.
Adrenocortical carcinoma:
Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are rare aggressive tumors with an incidence of approximately 1-2 per million per year [5]. 60% of ACCs are functioning. Cushing's syndrome alone or a mixed Cushing's and virilisation syndrome are the most common presentation. Virilisation, feminisation or hyperaldosteronism alone is rare (< 10%). Patients with nonfunctioning adrenocortical carcinomas usually present with abdominal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal fullness, flank or back pain due to the large size of the tumor. Adrenocortical carcinomas may be sporadic or associated with hereditary syndromes, including MEN1, Lynch syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Peak incidences are in early childhood and in the fourth and fifth decade of life [5]. Typical imaging features of adrenocortical carcinomas are [5,10]: Imaging pittfalls: More than half of ACC patients have stage III or IV disease at the time of diagnosis, which explains the dismal prognosis of this diagnosis, with 5-year survival of 50% for stage III, and 15% for stage IV. So, it is important to look for adjacent organ invasion, and for lymph node and distant metastases, most commonly in lung, liver or bone. Here a typical example of an adrenocortical carcinoma. The tumor is bulky and shows heterogeneous enhancement. Note the 'stellar' central hypodensity. There is capsular enhancement. Small adrenocortical carcinomas have less typical features, but also enhance inhomogeneously. Also note the dystrophic calcifications and areas of necrosis (red arrows). MRI-images of a 5.6 cm right adrenal carcinoma incidentally discovered on ultrasound. Top row: mild T1W hypointensity, moderate T2W hyperintensity and intense hyperintensity on DWI. Lower row: Post contrast images show inhomogenous progressive enhancement with inhomogeneous progressive capsular enhancement in the portal and delayed phase. Axial and coronal CT images in a patients with a right adrenal carcinoma and extensive IVC invasion. The coronal image also shows tumor extension into the right renal vein. Axial and coronal CT images of another patient with an adrenal carcinoma with extensive IVC invasion (yellow arrow). IVC and renal vein tumor invasion are seen in up to 20% of patients. More than half of ACC patients have stage III or IV disease at the time of diagnosis with poor 5-year survival. Here a large right adrenal adrenal carcinoma with extensive abdominal and mediastinal para-aortic lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis. Atypical adenoma
Atypical adenomas:
Lesions are considered atypical for adenoma if they show: The following lesions were all resected because of large size, indeterminate radiological features or interval growth. Here a 68 mm right hyperenhancing adrenal lesion with small calcifications and cystic spots, uncharacteristic for an adenoma. Atypical adenoma with a post hemorrhagic pseudocyst This is an enlarged left adrenal gland with a 6,4 cm well encapsulated hypodense, possibly cystic lesion, but with a density >10 HU. Histology showed an adenoma with a post hemorrhagic pseudocyst. Atypical adenoma with hyperdense strands as a result of internal bleeding The image shows a 7,6 cm left adrenal lesion with density < 0 HU, but with hyperdense strands. On histology, this was shown to be due to internal bleeding in an adenoma. Atypical adenoma with no signal drop and heterogeneous enhancement. These images are of a very atypical large adenoma. There is no signal drop on the opposed phase image. The post contrast image shows heterogeneous enhancement. On resection this proved to be an adenoma, however.
Pitfalls fatty lesions:
Oncocytoma of the left adrenal with fatty components. Macroscopic fat is fairly specific for myelolipomas, but has also been described uncommonly in adenomas, adrenal teratomas, metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and even adrenocortical carcinoma. If the macroscopic fat content exceeds 50%, the diagnosis of adrenal myelolipoma can be confidently made [4]. It is safe to follow-up incidentally discovered, asymptomatic adrenal myelolipomas. Usually they are resected when they are larger than 7 cm, symptomatic (mass effect, pain), hormonally active or complicated by bleeding [5]. The image shows a fat-containing adrenal lesion, which is well-demarcated and contains soft tissue, fatty components and some calcifications. This lesion was removed because of its large size of 13 cm and uncertain origin. It turned out to be an oncocytoma with fatty and myeloid metaplasia. This is another very large adrenal lesion of uncertain origin with macroscopic fat and dystrophic calcifications. This proved to be a liposarcoma with osteosarcomatous differentiation.
MRI protocol:
MRI is usually deployed as a problem solver after inconclusive CT or if contrast enhanced CT is contra-indicated. MRI protocol should include [4,5]: DWI has no added value due to considerable overlap in ADC values between benign and malignant adrenal lesions [11]. Most radiologists use visual evaluation to determine whether there is signal drop on out-of-phase images. However, it is also possible to measure the change in signal intensity within a ROI placed over the adrenal lesion on the out-of-phase image and compare this to the in-phase image, using the spleen as internal reference organ. Either the adrenal-to-spleen ratio (ASR) or the adrenal signal intensity index (SI-index) may be calculated by using the Adrenal MRI calculator [12,13]. An ASR <0.71 and SI-index >16.5% indicate an adrenal adenoma. The reported sensitivity for ASR is 58 - 99% and the specificity is 84-86%. Chemical shift imaging is less sensitive than washout CT for detecting lipid-poor adenomas, in particular when unenhanced CT density is 20 HU or higher [13]. This adrenal lesion was discovered on a pulmonary embolism scan. Using the Adrenal MRI calculator the adrenal spleen ratio (ASR) and signal intensity index (SI-index) can be measured from ROIs placed inside the adrenal lesion and the spleen on both the in-phase and out-of-phase images. Based on the signal intensities measured within ROIs placed over the adrenal lesion and spleen the ASR is 0,66 (< 0,71) and and the SII is 39,5% (> 16,5%), indicating that this is an adenoma.
PET-CT:

FDG - Nonspecific adrenal tumor imaging:
Malignant tumors have higher glucose metabolism than benign tumors. This enables PET-CT imaging with the glucose analogue 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG). FDG is not specific for any certain adrenal tumor, but can be used to differentiate pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, adrenocortical carcinomas and adrenal metastases from benign tumors. Axial venous phase CT in mediastinal and bone window setting Images depict mediastinal and bone window setting of a patient with a bulky heterogeneously enhancing right adrenal tumor. This was proven to be an adrenocortical carcinoma. There is a faint, ill-defined liver lesion in segment 6 and there are non-specific sclerotic changes in the body of T12. Continue with the PET-image... PET-CT performed for complete staging shows intense uptake in the adrenal tumor, indicative of its malignant nature. There is also intense uptake in two liver metastases and in a bone metastasis in T12. Approximately 20-40% of patients with an adrenocortical carcinoma present with metastases at diagnosis. Whole-body FDG PET-CT can distinguish benign from malignant lesions with high sensitivity (100%), but with lower specificity (87- 97%). False positives are due to a small number of adenomas, pheochromocytomas, inflammatory and infectious lesions, that mimic malignant lesions [14]. Possible false negatives are hemorrhagic, necrotic or small (5-10 mm) metastases and metastases from relatively low FDG-avid primary cancers, like minimally invasive adenocarcinoma or carcinoid tumors [14]. Apart from visual evaluation it is also possible to use standardized uptake values (SUVs) with a certain cut-off value (SUVmax 2,68-3.7) or an adrenal-to-liver SUV ratio (reported cutoff values 1.29-1.45) to differentiate benign from malignant adrenal lesions, with high sensitivity and specificity [14, 15]. Combining FDG PET-CT and adrenal washout CT can further improve the accuracy for diagnosing adrenal malignancy [16]. This axial venous CT shows a very bulky right adrenal mass, suspicious for a malignancy, based on the large size and heterogeneity. This lesion is an adrenocortical carcinoma, but in contrast to the former example, subsequent FDG PET-CT performed for staging purposes showed only mild uptake and only in the most avidly enhancing part of the tumor. Most adrenocortical carcinomas show intense FDG-uptake. This lack of FDG-avidity might be due to a lower grade tumor with lower mitotic rate or large hemorrhagic or necrotic components. First postoperative axial venous phase CT performed 3 months after left adrenalectomy for a large adrenocortical carcinoma showing an enhancing nodule posterior to the left kidney. Restaging FDG PET-CT showed intense uptake in only this lesion, which proved to be a metastasis on subsequent follow-up imaging. The left renal subcapsular hematoma is unrelated.
Pheochromocytoma-specific imaging:
Axial arterial and venous phase CT show a hypervascular left-sided adrenal incidentaloma. Plasma free metanephrines were elevated, diagnostic of a pheochromocytoma. Further staging included a MIBG SPECT and a FDG PET-CT, which both showed intense uptake in the left adrenal tumor, but no evidence of metastatic disease. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas originate from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. These are neuroendocrine cells that express cell membrane norepinephrine transporters and secrete catecholamines, noradrenaline, dopamine and a few other hormones. This is the basis for the use of tracers like 131I- and 123I-MIBG, which accumulate within adrenergic tissue, making MIBG scanning specific for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 18F-fluorodopamine (DA) are 18F-labeled pheochromocytoma-specific compounds which can be used for PET-CT imaging [19]. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas also have somatostatin receptors and thus can be imaged using somatostatin analogues. The somatostatin scan (or Octreoscan) is now being replaced more and more by PET-CT using 68 gallium-labeled somatostatin analogues like DOTA-TOC, DOTA-NOC or DOTA-TATE [19]. The axial venous phase CT on the left shows a large inhomogeneously enhancing right adrenal lesion with a small cyst, which could not be diagnosed as an adenoma with CT washout, making it an indeterminate lesion. The plasma free metanephrines were elevated and the lesion was diagnosed as a pheochromocytoma. MIBG SPECT for staging showed intense uptake in only the right adrenal gland. PET-CT was also performed, which in contrast showed uptake only slightly higher than normal liver. This is highly unusual for pheochromocytomas, which are usually very FDG-avid, even when they are benign. If the primary tumor lacks FDG uptake, the sensitivity for finding metastases on an FDG PET-CT will be very low. The upper left image is a venous phase screening CT in a patient with a known SDHD-gene mutation which is associated with a high risk for developing pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. There is a hypervascular right adrenal tumor. A MIBG SPECT was performed, which showed intense uptake, helping to confirm the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma. A year later, screening was performed with 68 Ga- DOTATATE PET-CT. This shows intense uptake in the right adrenal gland, but also intense uptake in a glomus caroticum tumor on the left as seen on the coronal MIP to the right. The DOTATATE uptake in the spleen and pituitary gland are normal, as is the normal excretion by the kidneys to the bladder. Pheochromocytomas express somatostatin receptors, making them suitable for imaging with a somatostatin-analogue. In this case 68 gallium-labeled DOTATOC is used. This patient presented with widespread metastatic disease to the lungs, liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodes after resection of a pheochromocytoma. Continue with the PET-CT... PET-CT of the same patient with 68 gallium-labeled DOTATOC.
Endocrine evaluation:
Up to 15% of all adrenal tumors are functional: Current guidelines from the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) [2,3] recommend an initial biochemical evaluation of all adrenal incidentalomas to exclude pheochromocytoma, subclinical Cushing's syndrome and hyperaldosteronism. The following hormones should be assessed in all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma: The following hormones should be assessed conditionally : sex hormones and steroid precursors in patients with suspected ACC.

Large airway disease:
Onno Mets and Hans Daniels
Radiology and Pulmonology department University Medical Center Amsterdam:
Publicationdate 2023-05-20 Pathology of the
 trachea and central bronchi is infrequently encountered, and therefore most
 radiologists find it challenging. Although there is a relatively limited differential diagnosis, pathology
 nevertheless varies between congenital, benign, primary malignant and
 metastatic disease. This article summarizes
 the typical imaging features of the differential diagnostic considerations of large airway diseases and hopefully serves as a reference for those that need it every now and
 then.
Introduction:
The central airways consist of the
trachea and main bronchi, before the airways branch towards the periphery into
the lobar, segmental and subsegmental airways on both sides. The trachea has a length of about 10-15 cm and has an extrathoracic and
intrathoracic component. It contains about 15-20 horseshoe shaped cartilaginous
rings. 
The posterior wall of the trachea and main bronchi is membranous and
does not contain cartilage, which is important for the imaging differential
diagnosis, as will be discussed later. The inner lining of the airways consists
of respiratory ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells, minor
salivary glands and neuro-endocrine cells. 
Furthermore, the airways contain
muscle tissue, cartilage, nerves, etc. 
All of which may give rise to pathology.
Differential diagnosis:
Central airway
pathology can be divided into subgroups, either by etiology (ie. inflammatory,
neoplastic, etc.) or by imaging appearance (ie. nodular, single/multifocal, diffuse
infiltration, etc.). In the table an overview based on
disease etiology subgroups to provide a comprehensive overview. This is a flow-chart that is based on imaging appearances, which can be used to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
Nodular - differential:
Nodular
lesions protrude into the lumen and distort the smooth inner contour of the
airway. 
Only a minority of these lesions will have specific morphologic
features. 
Here some examples of nodular or mass lesions in the trachea and
bronchi.
Wall thickening - differential:
At the site
of involvement there is loss of the normal smooth and thin contour of the
tracheal and bronchial wall. 
Only a few diseases have specific morphologic
features. 
Here some examples of both focal and diffuse central airway wall
thickening.
Iatrogenic:

Post-intubation:
The most common iatrogenic central airway
pathology is focal stenosis after endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy.
Focal fibrosis may occur in reaction to necrosis caused by cuff pressure or due
to direct iatrogenic damage of the tracheal wall. Typically, a subglottic
stenosis near the thoracic inlet is seen with an hourglass shape in the coronal
plane, due to a short segment of focal scarring in the trachea (figure). Bronchoscopy images from above and below the
level of the vocal cords, show a significant subglottic narrowing of the trachea.
Radiotherapy:
When applied to tumors in proximity to
the central airways radiotherapy can cause airway narrowing, fistula, necrosis and sometimes massive hemoptysis. 
In addition mediastinal fatty
infiltration and esophageal wall thickening may be present in the acute phase. Image
Wall thickening of the trachea bifurcation post-radiotherapy.
Foreign body:
Aspiration of a foreign body is rare in adults, and most often encountered in children.
Among adults aspiration of dental parts is relatively common, especially in the trauma population. Conventional imaging after aspiration may not show a radiopaque foreign body, depending on material composition.
Indirect signs might be present though, for example unilateral hyperinflation or lung atelectasis due to check valve mechanism and obstruction, respectively. ImageAspiration of device during dental surgery, visible in the right lower lobe bronchus. BronchiolithEndobronchial calcification which may be caused by
calcification of aspirated foreign material, or migration or erosion and
extrusion of adjacent calcified material from for example a lymph node or
ossified bronchial cartilage.
Mucus:
The most encountered focal abnormality in the trachea is mucus.
In large quantities it can cause bronchial obstruction and atelectasis, especially in the ICU setting.
In most cases it represents an irrelevant finding, but small quantities sticking to the airway wall may create a diagnostic dilemma. 
In general mucus may show an associated mucus thread and is often not dense enough to be seen on the soft tissue reconstruction windows.
When in doubt whether focal airway wall pathology is present, follow-up imaging or bronchoscopy might be considered.
Mucus will resolve or change position on follow-up CT imaging, whereas a solid lesion persists.
Extrinsic compression:

Enlarged goiter:
Intrinsic versus extrinsic pathology is one
of the first differentiations that has to be made when interpreting CT
imaging. The most common cause of extrinsic compression
is intrathoracic extension of an enlarged thyroid, causing
displacement of the trachea more than narrowing. Other mediastinal
causes are:
Lymph nodes:
Compression of the right main bronchus by enlarged lymph nodes.
Double aortic arch:
This patient has a double aortic arch which compresses the trachea.
Fibrosing mediastinitis:
Fibrosing mediastinitis is a more tricky
cause of extrinsic compression and displacement as it is often hard to diagnose
with certainty. 
On CT imaging it can show considerable overlap with findings of
airway involvement due to a central lung malignancy. 
Repetitive negative tissue
sampling and follow-up will often seal the case eventually. Image
Right-sided fibrosing mediastinitis in a 51 year old male, showing soft tissue density around the right main bronchus (arrow). Same patient. There are secondary signs of central airway and vessel
compression, with localized lung volume loss and interstitial thickening due to
edema.
Benign neoplasm:

Hamartoma:
Hamartoma is a benign lesion that is composed
of various mesenchymal tissues such as chondroid cartilage, fat and fibrous
tissue. 
It is the most common benign lung tumor and most often located more
peripherally in the lung parenchyma, but sometimes arises in the airways. Image
Endobronchial
hamartoma as an incidental finding in the middle lobe of a 73 y.o male. CT characteristics of a hamartoma are independent of its location: ImageFat containing hamartoma obstructing the left lower lobe bronchus in a 58 y.o female. Lipoma Typically seen as an endoluminal lesion
without soft tissue component due to its pure fatty nature. It arises from the
submucosal fat tissue of the tracheobronchial tree. The lesion is often
pedunculated, although this is not always evident on CT. Leiomyoma Leiomyoma arise from the smooth muscle
cells of the trachea. Typically it is seen as an endoluminal mass in relation
to the posterior wall. The lesion may show heterogeneous density due to cystic
degeneration as a result of poor vascularity.
Papilloma:
A squamous cell
papilloma is the solitary variant of tracheobronchial papillomatosis, where
papillomatous growth of the epithelium is a response to HPV infection. Laryngeal involvement is more common than tracheobronchial disease and when
central airway involvement occurs it may be seen on CT as multifocal nodularity not extending beyond the wall, and without calcification. Image
Tracheobronchial
papillomatosis with lung involvement in a 54 y.o male, showing two papillomas
in the trachea. 
Continue with the lung window... The image shows multiple cystic lesions in both lungs (arrowheads). In rare cases extension into the lung parenchyma can occur, showing cystic nodules most often in the dependent apical segments of the lower lobes. There is a small risk of malignant transformation from squamous cell papilloma into squamous cell carcinoma. Schwannoma
Miscellaneous:
Given that any cell type present in the
central airways may give rise to pathology, all kind of rare lesions can develop. This includes for example neurogenic tumors (figure) and rare lesions such as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.
Malignant neoplasm:
Several primary malignant lesions arise in
the central airways. 
Often they cause respiratory symptoms, and sometimes
hemoptysis. 
In line with the benign neoplastic lesions, a specific radiological
diagnosis is challenging. 
Patient characteristics such as age, smoking history,
as well as lesion morphology and location may give clues and will influence the
order of differential diagnostic considerations.
Given that any cell type present in the
central airways may give rise to pathology, all kind of rare lesions
develop. 
This includes for example malignant lesions such as chondrosarcoma. Radical surgical resection is
the preferred treatment, but often technically impossible.
Depending on the histology
and stage of the tumour, other modalities such as chemoradiotherapy may be used
with curative intent.
Squamous cell carcinoma:
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common primary
malignancy of the trachea. 
Generally, it occurs in older patients with a
substantial smoking history.
Typically, an irregular mass is seen that tends
to invade surrounding tissues outside the airway wall. Image

focal mass that invades the trachea wall and peritracheal tissue in a 66 y.o
male. PA:
Squamous cell carcinoma.
Adenoid cystic carcinoma:
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is the next most common
primary malignancy of the central airways. Contrary to squamous cell carcinoma there is no association
with smoking. Patients also tend to be younger, mostly middle-aged. Radiologically adenoid cystic carcinoma can present as either
a: Image Severe luminal narrowing by a focal mass in 48 y.o female. PA: Tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma. The malignancy arises from the submucosal minor salivary glands, as does the less common mucoepidermoid carcinoma (see below).
The tumor is mostly very centrally located.
The most common sites for metastases are the lung parenchyma and the liver. ImageIrregular

PA:
adenoid cystic carcinoma. Bronchoscopic view of
obstructing tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma. Mucoepidermoid
carcinoma (MEC) As mentioned above, MEC is a tumour
that arises from the submucosal minor salivary glands. It is found in younger
patients - often younger than those with ACC - and has no known association
with smoking. It has a predilection for the more distal airways, as they are found
more often in the segmental/lobar airways and rarely in the trachea.  CT imaging features are non-specific; an
enhancing focal soft tissue mass, with varying degrees of heterogeneity. Some
show internal calcification. Post-obstructive changes may be present. Carcinoid in the left main bronchus
Carcinoid:
Carcinoid tumours are low-grade
neuroendocrine tumours (NET) that originate from the neuroendocrine cells in
the airway wall.
Histopathologically, they may be typical or atypical, depending
on the mitotic rate and the presence of focal necrosis. 
The majority are
typical carcinoids though, and these behave quite indolent. 
They are found in
both younger and older patients, and there is no association with smoking. ImageWell-defined mass in the left main
bronchus in a 39 year old male.
Continue with the PET-CT... High uptake on PET-CT confirming the neuroendocrine cell origin The 68Ga-Dotatate PET-CT shows vivid uptake  confirming the neuroendocrine cell origin.
Carcinoids arise in the more central airways (although hardly
ever in the trachea) as well as in the more peripheral ones, all the way
towards the outer third of the lung. On CT carcinoid is a well-defined lesion, often hyperdense on post-contrast CT given their hypervascular nature.
Calcifications may be present in a minority.
Post-obstructive changes are common due to luminal obstruction, and may be the reason it is found.
Some lesions also show an extraluminal component, which excludes the option of complete curation through an endoscopic procedure.
Anatomical surgical resection is needed in these cases. Continue with the bronchoscopic view... Bronchoscopic view of carcinoid Bronchoscopic view showing the typical finding of a well-defined and
vascularized lesion obstructing the lower lobe orifice.
PA: Carcinoid. Metastasis of colorectal cancer
Metastases:
Metastatic disease to the
central airways does occur through distant hematogenous or lymphatic spread.
Although uncommon, it is sometimes seen for instance in breast carcinoma, renal cell cancer and colorectal carcinoma. Imaging findings are nonspecific and may show single or multiple solid nodules
projecting into the airway lumen. 
Larger and more peripheral lesions may cause
airway obstruction. 
Usually airway metastatic disease is not an isolated finding, but seen in patients with known metastatic disease. ImageThe PET-CT shows high uptake corresponding to a small nodular
lesion in the proximal trachea in a 52 y.o female with prior colorectal
cancer. 
PA: metastasis of colorectal cancer.
Infection:

TB:
As with most other infectious diseases, pathogens causing
tracheobronchial infection can be either bacterial, fungal or viral. Community acquired bronchitis is mostly triggered by a viral
infection. Sometimes infection may be associated with procedures such as
tracheostomy, as shown on the left. Although tuberculosis can cause central airway
abnormalities, isolated tracheobronchitis is very rare. 
Central airway involvement during more widespread thoracic
disease is more likely, and can reveal itself on CT imaging as irregular focal
or more diffuse wall thickening. 
In the chronic phase it may lead to focal
airway stenosis due to airway remodelling and formation of fibrosis in reaction
to ulceration of submucosal tubercles. Image
Focal wall thickening with luminal narrowing of the trachea and right main bronchus in a 63 y.o female with remote TB infection. Biopsy showed fibroelastic scarring. Fungal infections causing tracheobronchitis might also be encountered, for example by Aspergillus, Candida or Histoplasmosis.
This occurs primarily in the immunocompromised population.
In line with the above mentioned TB morphology, it may cause non-specific CT findings of focal or more diffuse wall thickening, with residual scarring and stenosis in later stages of the disease. ImageDiffuse

uptake on FDG-PET scan (blue arrow) in a 72 y.o male after tracheostomy due to
complicated thyroidectomy.
Clinically labelled as low-grade infectious,
despite the fact that no specific pathogen was cultured.
Inflammatory:

Relapsing polychondritis:
Relapsing polychondritis is an auto-immune disorder that affects
the cartilage in the central airways with recurrent episodes of inflammation
and possible destruction and fibrosis. 
As cartilage in other parts of the body
may also be affected, clinically one may see ear and nose involvement as well
(eg. saddle-nose deformity). Cardiovascular disease such as cardiac valve
disease and aortic aneurysm can occur. On CT imaging of the chest central airway wall
thickening with soft tissue density is seen.
Abnormalities typically spare the
posterior wall which lacks cartilage. Beyond the acute phase calcification and stenosis may form, as well as
excessive airway collapse in expiration (ie. tracheobronchomalacia) due to
cartilage destruction. ImageRelapsing polychondritis in a 55 y.o female, showing inflammatory central airway wall thickening with the characteristic horseshoe shaped appearance (arrowhead). No thickening of posterior wall (yellow arrow).
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis:
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a
multisystem necrotizing vasculitis that affects the medium and small size vessels with involvement of paranasal sinuses, lungs and kidneys. 
Clinically
it is associated with elevated c-ANCA titers. 
GPA can cause irregular
circumferential wall thickening of the central airways, which can lead to
stenosis in later stages of the disease. 
This is typically seen in the
subglottic trachea but also occurs in the main stem and lobar bronchi. Synchronous
pulmonary findings of cavitating consolidations and ground glass caused by the
vasculitis – due to necrosis and alveolar hemorrhage, respectively – are
helpful to sort the differential diagnostic considerations. Image
Central airway involvement in GPA showing circumferential tracheal wall thickening at the level of the carina in a 43 y.o male. There is left lung collapse due to chronic involvement of the left main bronchus with stenosis.
Amyloidosis:
Tracheobronchial amyloidosis is characterized by submucosal
deposition of abnormal amyloid protein. 
It is a very rare disease, which is
usually isolated but can be associated with systemic amyloid disease. The protein deposition can either be focal (ie. mass-like;
amyloidoma) or more diffuse and infiltrative. 
Amyloid in the airway walls leads
to dense and calcified, strikingly irregular soft tissue thickening on CT
imaging. 
There is no cure, and therapeutic options such as external beam
radiation and bronchoscopic debulking are focussed on limiting luminal
obstruction to relieve respiratory symptoms. Image
Tracheobronchial amyloidosis in a 61 y.o
female, showing irregular airway wall thickening with dense and calcified foci causing
significant luminal narrowing of the right main bronchus.
Bronchoscopy
shows typical yellowish irregular lesions. Sarcoidosis
The most common manifestations of sarcoidosis in the chest
are symmetrical hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary parenchymal
involvement with lymphatic distribution of small nodules. 
This imaging
morphology is classic, but the disease is known for its wide range of
appearances and may be considered in the differential diagnosis for a lot of
imaging findings. Although histopathologically granulomatous involvement of the
airways is relatively common, CT signs of central airway involvement in
sarcoidosis are relatively rare.
Of course, architectural distortion and airway
obstruction may be caused by extrinsic compression due to peribronchial fibrosis, which is often seen in the
hilar regions. 
In addition, direct airway remodelling due to granulomatous involvement
of the central airways may lead to circumferential airway wall thickening.
If
present, it is almost always part of more extensive thoracic disease and not an
isolated finding. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)Both
ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) may show airway involvement.
More common than central airway disease is peripheral bronchial wall thickening
and bronchiectasis, as well as signs of involvement of the smaller airways (ie.
bronchiolitis and air trapping).   
When
the trachea and main bronchi are involved, CT imaging may show nonspecific
circumferential wall thickening, luminal narrowing and postobstructive
findings. Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica
Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica:
The etiology of this disease is not well known. 
It is
characterized by submucosal osteocartilaginous nodules that on CT imaging
present as multiple small calcified nodules that only involve the cartilaginous
portion of the central airways, and thus spares the posterior wall of the
trachea. 
This disease may be an incidental finding, but may also
cause mild respiratory symptoms. 
The prognosis is generally good and in
asymptomatic cases no interventions are needed.
If needed, therapeutic options may be focussed on limiting luminal obstruction caused
by the osteocartilaginous nodules. ImageTracheobronchopathia

Two examples of a tracheal bronchus
Tracheal bronchus:
Airway branching variation is very common, especially at
the segmental level. 
Several anatomical variants are encountered on a more
regular basis and might be worth mentioning, although patients are mostly asymptomatic. 
If
they do lead to symptoms, this is mostly due to recurrent infections caused by abnormal
drainage. In case of a tracheal
bronchus (also called pig bronchus) the
right upper lobe parenchyma is partially aerated through a separate bronchus
that originates directly from the supracarinal portion of the trachea. Image

Cardiac bronchus:
This truly supernumerary bronchus
originates on the medial side of the bronchus intermedius, opposite to the
right upper lobe orifice. 
This might be a blind ending structure, or an airway
that aerates a small amount of lung parenchyma. ImageCardiac

Tracheobronchomegaly:
Tracheobronchomegaly (also called Mounier-Kuhn syndrome) is caused by
abnormal elastic fibres and smooth muscle cells in the central airways.
Typically, it is seen in middle aged men who present with
chronic cough and/or recurrent infections. CT findings: Williams-Campbell syndrome with widespread bronchiectasis
Williams-Campbell syndrome:
This
disease is characterized by congenital cystic bronchiectasis, and typically
presents with recurrent infections. 
It is thought to be caused by cartilage
deficiency in the subsegmental bronchi (ie. 4th to 6th order). 
It therefore shows bilateral diffuse
bronchiectasis on CT imaging, with typical sparing of the lower order bronchi
and trachea. 
This in contrast to
tracheobronchomegaly that typically involves the 1st to 4th order bronchi. ImageLocalized perihilar bronchiectasis but normal dimensions of the trachea, main bronchi as well as peripheral airways.

Ovarian cystic lesions:

Publicationdate 2011-05-18 In this review the imaging features of normal ovaries and the most common ovarian cystic masses are presented. In Ovarian Cystic Masses Part I a roadmap for the diagnostic workup and management of ovarian cystic masses is presented based on the findings of ultrasound and MRI. Images can be enlarged by clicking on them. On the iPhone application this results in hi-res images at full retina resolution.
Normal ovaries:

premenopausal:
The normal ovary contains over two million primary oocytes at birth, about 10 of which mature each menstrual cycle. Of the 10 Graafian follicles that begin to mature, only one becomes the dominant follicle and grows to a size of 18-20 mm by mid-cycle, when it ruptures to release the oocyte. The other nine follicles become atretic and fibrous. After release of the oocyte, the dominant follicle collapses, and the granulosa cells in the inner lining proliferate and swell to form the corpus luteum of menstruation. Over the course of 14 days the corpus luteum degenerates, leaving the small scarred corpus albicans. Graafian follicles Graafian follicles The normal ovary in pre-menopausal women contains small cysts. The images show two normal ovaries with several anechoic, simple cysts consistent with Graafian follicles. On T2-weighted MR-images the Graafian follicles are seen as bright cysts surrounded by darker solid ovarian stroma. FDG-PET pitfall - normal premenopausal ovaries In some pre-menopausal women the normal ovaries may be avidly PET positive, depending on the date in the menstrual cycle. Because in pre-menopausal women a PET-positive ovary may be either an adnexal neoplasm or completely normal, it is important to be aware of the possibility of physiologic mid-cycle FDG uptake and to correlate this finding with the clinical history. FDG-PET in pre-menopausal women should therefore preferably be scheduled in the first week of the menstrual cycle. In post-menopausal women, the normal ovaries show only minimal uptake of FDG. Any increased ovarian FDG uptake in this age group is suspicious for a possible neoplasm. LEFT: Postmenopausal woman. The ovary is a T2 dark tissue clump near the proximal end of the round ligament.RIGHT: T2 dark left ovary devoid of follicles. It is a bit prominent, but is still likely to be normal
Post-menopausal:
Post-menopause is defined as 1 year or more of amenorrhea. In Western countries the average age of menopause is 51-53 years. In post-menopausal women the ovaries are generally smaller and gradually stop forming Graafian follicles. Note, however, that follicular cysts may persist several years after menopause. In the coronal T2-weighted image of a postmenopausal woman the ovary is no more than a dark tissue clump near the proximal end of the round ligament. The axial T2-weighted image also shows a dark left ovary, devoid of follicles. Although a bit prominent, this is likely to be completely normal. Only if, by chance, there happened to be prior imaging showing that the lesion was growing, your differential diagnosis would start with a benign solid lesion such as ovarian fibroma or fibrothecoma.
Functional cysts:
By far the most common cystic ovarian lesions are benign functional ovarian cysts. Functional cysts are Graafian follicles or corpora lutea that have grown too large or have bled, but are otherwise benign. In the early post-menopause phase, 1-5 years after the final menstrual period, sporadic ovulatory cycles still may occur and ovarian cysts may be seen. Even in late menopause, which is defined as more than 5 years since the final menstrual period, when ovulation is unlikely to occur, small simple cysts may be seen in up to 20% of women.
Follicular cyst:
A dominant Graafian follicle sometimes fails to ovulate and does not involute. When it becomes larger than 3 cm, it is called a follicular cyst. Follicular cysts are usually 3-8 cm, but may become much larger. On ultrasound follicular cysts present as simple unilocular, anechoic cysts with a thin, smooth wall. There should be no enhancing nodules or other solid components, no enhancing septations, and no more than physiologic ascites. Follicular cysts will usually resolve spontaneously on follow-up.
Corpus luteum cyst:
A corpus luteum may seal and fill with fluid or blood, forming a corpus luteum cyst. The transvaginal ultrasound images show a small complex ovarian cyst with wall vascularity on power Doppler analysis. The characteristic circular Doppler appearance is called the 'ring of fire'. Note, there is good through-transmission and no internal vascularity, consistent with a, partially involuted, corpus luteum cyst. Remember that women who are on birth control pills usually won't form a corpus luteum, as birth control pills prevent ovulation. On the other hand, use of fertility drugs that induce ovulation, increases the chance of developing corpus luteum cysts. Corpus luteum cyst Another case with the typical the 'ring of fire' on ultrasound. At pathologic examination the collapsed bloody cyst can be clearly seen. Corpus luteum cyst Corpus luteum cyst at MRI: an axial T2-weighted image demonstrating an involuting corpus luteum cyst (arrow). This is a normal finding. The right ovary is also normal. Hemorrhagic cyst with a clot mimicking a neoplasm. Notice absence of flow and good through-transmission
Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst:
When a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. On ultrasound hemorrhagic ovarian cyst presents as an unilocular thin-walled cyst with fibrin-strands or low-level echoes and good through transmission. On MRI hemorrhagic cysts are bright on pre-contrast T1-FatSat, and dark on T2. There should be no internal vascularity on Doppler ultrasound or internal enhancement on CT or MRI. Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts have variable wall thickness, and often some circumferential vascularity can be seen. Clinically the classic presentation is with acute pain. However HOC can also be an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst The ultrasound images show multiple simple and one complex right ovarian lesion (red arrow). The latter demonstrates diffuse low-level echos and no flow on Doppler. Note that there is a good through transmission (blue arrow). These findings indicate the presence of a hemorrhagic cyst. Continue with the MR-images. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst Axial and sagittal T2W images from the same patient. The right ovary contains multiple simple T2 bright cysts with thin borders and no solid components. On the axial image there is one lesion, that is dark on T2, i.e. a complex cyst (arrow). There is a small amount of ascites around the right ovary, but not enough to raise concern of a possible neoplasm. On the T1-weighted image without fatsat the complex cyst is bright, indicating either fat or blood content. On the T1-weighted image with fatsat the lesion remains bright, ruling out a fatty lesion. After the administration of Gd there is no enhancement, confirming that this is a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. An endometrioma would be in your differential. Note that subtraction images are best to demonstrate the lack of enhancement in a lesion, that is bright on the pre-contrast T1-weighted image. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in both right and left ovary The ultrasound images show the right and left ovary: on both sides there is what appears to be a solid lesion. There is however good through transmission, which indicates that we are probably dealing with hemorrhagic cysts. On Doppler US (not shown) there was no vascularity. Continue with the MR examination. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst On an axial T1-weighted image both lesions are bright indicating fat, blood or high protein fluid. Fat saturation does not suppress the signal in these lesions. In an image with overall reasonably good fat suppression this rules out a fat-containing teratoma and confirms the suggestion of hemorrhagic fluid. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. Left:image without subtraction. Right: image with subtraction. On the axial T2-weighted image both lesions show typical 'shading'. The gradual drop in T2 is thought to be caused by a combination of increasing viscosity and increasing concentration of protein and iron towards the dependent portion of the lesion. There is no enhancement on the subtraction image (Post-Gd minus Pre-Gd). Again, subtraction is useful in cases like this: Gd-induced signal increase over the already very bright pre-contrast image would be very hard to appreciate otherwise.
Other benign cystic and cyst-like lesions:
Vaginal ultrasound showing a large hypoechoic cystic lesion with diffuse low-level echo's
Endometrioma:
Cystic endometriosis or endometrioma is a type of cyst formed when endometrial tissue grows in the ovaries. It affects women during the reproductive years and may cause chronic pelvic pain associated with menstruation. The ovaries are involved in approximately 75% of patients with endometriosis. On ultrasound endometrioma can be variable but the great majority (about 95%) of patients present with a classic homogeneous, hypoechoic cyst with diffuse low level echoes. Rarely it is anechoic, mimicking a functional ovarian cyst. Endometriomas can be multilocular and have thin or even thick septations. Transvaginal ultrasound: endometrioma with two hyperechoic wall foci, consistent with cholesterol deposits (arrows) In about one third of patients, on careful examination, small echogenic foci can be seen adhering to the wall. These have been postulated to be cholesterol deposits, but may also constitute small blood clots or debris. It is important to differentiate these foci from true wall nodules. In the presence of these foci, the diagnosis of an endometrioma is very likely. The transvaginal ultrasound shows a typical endometrioma, with hyperechoic wall foci. At Doppler US no vascularity was seen in these foci (not shown). The next case is a transvaginal US-image that shows a cystic lesion with a hyperechoic structure. There is a wide differential diagnosis including ovarian cystic neoplasm with solid component, mature cystic teratoma with hyperechoic Rokitansky nodule, hemorrhagic cyst with clot and endometrioma with clot or debris. Continue with the CT and MR. Endometrioma A CT was requested that turned out to show the same, predominantly cystic lesion. If additional imaging is needed for cysts that are indeterminate at ultrasound, it is better to perform MRI. The T2-weighted image on the right correlates nicely with the ultrasound image. On T2-weighted images endometriomas typically show 'shading'. LEFT: Gd-enhanced T1-weighted image with fatsat. RIGHT: Subtraction image. MRI confirms the absence of any enhancement, confirming that it is most likely debris within the cyst. On MRI the hemorrhagic content will make endometrioma appear bright on T1-weighted images. On T1-fatsat images an endometrioma will remain bright. This in contrast to teratomas, that are also bright on T1 but dark on T1-fatsat images. Always include a T1 fat suppressed sequence, because this makes small T1 bright lesions more conspicuous. Endometrioma The next case is a unilocular, mildly hypoechoic ovarian lesion with through transmission. There is no internal or wall vascularity on Doppler. On ultrasound this can again either be a hemorrhagic cyst or an endometrioma. Continue with the MR images Endometrioma 6 months later a follow-up MRI was performed. The lesions are bright on T1-weighted images. The bright signal persists on fat saturation indicating the presence of blood. There is T2 shading consistent with a hemorrhagic lesion. There is no enhancement. The fluid-fluid level in the right ovarian lesion also confirms its cystic nature. The fact that the lesions persist after 6 months makes bilateral endometrioma much more likely than hemorrhagic cysts. Axial MR demonstrating characteristic 'string-of-pearls' appearance
Polycystic ovary syndrome:
The Poly-Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Imaging can confirm or suggest the diagnosis. Imaging criteria: These patients usually have menstrual cycle irregularities and either typical clinical signs of hirsutism, obesity, infertility, acne, male balding pattern or biochemically show increased androgen levels. Sagittal MR-image in a patient with polycystic ovary syndrome On the left a sagittal T2-weighted image in a patient with increased serum androgen levels. The ovary is enlarged and shows multiple small peripherally located simple cysts
The obesity associated with this syndrome is evident from the abundance of fat, showing bright on these FSE T2-weighted images. In this patient, MRI confirmed the diagnosis of PCOS. Theca lutein cysts. The septations do not show enhancement on Doppler evaluation.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome - Theca lutein cysts:
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a relatively rare condition. It is caused by hormonal overstimulation by hCG, and is therefore usually bilateral. Hormonal overstimulation can occur in gestational throphoblastic disease, PCOS or in patients receiving hormonal therapy. It can also be seen in pregnancy, but seldom in a normal single pregnancy. If it does occur in normal pregnancies, the reported natural course is spontaneous resolution after birth. In normal pregnancies the reported natural course is spontaneous resolution after birth. Hormonal overstimulation more often occurs in molar pregnancy, erythroblastosis fetalis or in plural pregnancies. On imaging there is - usually bilateral - ovarian enlargement with multiloculated cyst that can totally replace the ovary. The clinical history is the distinguishing feature to make the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Theca lutein cysts: US images of a young pregnant woman. In both ovaries there are multiple cysts. Right image shows an invasive uterine mass, consistent with invasive molar pregnancy. The US images are of a young pregnant woman, who had multiple ovarian cysts. The other ovary is not shown but showed a similar appearance. The features needed to make the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome are in the clinical history - a young pregnant woman - and in the last image of the uterus, which shows an invasive uterine mass, consistent with invasive molar pregnancy.
PID with tubo-ovarian abscess:
Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) usually arises as a complication of Chlamydia or Gonorrhoeae infection that rises from the vagina or cervix to the fallopian tubes. On imaging a thick-walled complex cystic ovarian lesion is seen with abundant flow. The presence of a thickened endometrium or hydrosalphinx makes the diagnosis of a PID more likely. The axial CECT image shows a left complex cystic lesion with thick enhancing walls and internal gas. It looks like an abscess. Note the relatively unremarkable aspect of the overlying mesentery: this is unlikely to be a peri-diverticular abscess. Continue with the reconstructed images. On the sagittal image notice, that the lesion is connected to the ovarian vein confirming that this is an ovarian lesion (arrow). The coronal image shows the anatomic connection to the uterus. There is a gasbubble in the uterine cavity, which confirms the suggestion of an infection rising from the uterine cavity via the salphinx to involve the ovary (click or tap the image to enlarge).
Benign cystic ovarian neoplasms:
Mature cystic teratoma with a Rokitansky nodule or dermoid plug
Mature cystic teratoma:
A very common benign ovarian lesion that may appear cystic is a mature cystic teratoma, also called dermoid cyst. Mature in this context means benign, as opposed to the immature, malignant teratoma. Benign cystic teratomas typically occur in young women of child-bearing age. At imaging they are usually unilocular (up to 90%) but can be multilocular, and are bilateral in ~15%. Up to 60% may contain calcifications. The cystic component is fluid fat, produced by sebaceous glands in cyst lining. The presence of fat is diagnostic. The characteristic ultrasound appearance is that of a cystic mass, with a hyperechoic solid mural nodule, which is called a Rokitansky nodule or dermoid plug (figure). Tip-of-the-iceberg sign In another case the transvaginal ultrasound shows the 'tip-of-the-iceberg' sign: acoustic shadowing from the hyperechoic part of the dermoid cyst. This may be misinterpreted as bowel gas and the lesion may be overlooked. A fat-fluid level may be present, caused by fat floating on more aqueous fluid. Multiple thin, echogenic lines or stripes may be seen, caused by hair floating in the cyst cavity. Mature cystic teratomas, even though benign, are often resected because of increased risk of ovarian torsion, the most commonly associated complication. Other complications associated with teratoma are infection, rupture (spontaneous or trauma) and, rarely, hemolytic anemia (resolves with resection). Malignant transformation can occur but is also rare ( Axial T1-weighted image in the same patient shows a bright lesion with an internal septation. A septation is seen in about 10% of thse lesions. On the T1-weighted image with fat suppression there is suppression of the signal. This confirms the fatty content and is diagnostic of a teratoma. Classic low attenuation consistent with fat in a right sided cystic teratoma at CT.
Cystadenoma and cystadenofibroma:
Cystadenoma and cystadenofibroma are also common benign ovarian tumors. They can be either serous or mucinous. At imaging a serous cystadenoma is most often unilocular and anechoic, and may look like a simple cyst. Mucinous cystadenomas are most often multilocular with thin (
The locules may contain complex fluid, due to proteinaceous debris or hemorrhage, or both. The finding of papillary projections should raise the suspicion of a possible borderline malignancy or a cystadenocarcinoma. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a 5.1x5.2-cm dominant left ovarian cyst. The cyst is anechoic and no septations are seen. Also there is no ascites. There is, however, a nodule on the posterior wall that shows no flow on Doppler. This may be a follicular cyst with some debris, but a cystic neoplasm cannot be excluded. Work-up with MRI is recommended. T2-weighted image of the same patient shows thin enhancing septations (as well as motion artifacts that should not be mistaken for septations). There are no tumor nodules and no adenopathy or peritoneal deposits. There is only a small amount of ascites. This proved to be a cystadenoma. The next case is another cystic lesion On the posterior wall a solid mural nodule is found, which is avascular. No secondary signs of malignancy. Continue with the MRI. Five years later the lesion has grown. Axial T2 shows a complex cystic left ovarian lesion, with a solid nodule on the posterior wall. At post-contrast axial T1W-FatSat the thin septa and the mural nodule show slight enhancement. On the basis of these findings the distinction between a benign ovarian lesion such as a cystadenofibroma and a malignant lesion cannot be made. The lesion was resected and was found to be a cystadenofibroma. The next case is a transabdominal ultrasound that shows a left-sided multiloculated cystic mass. This looks like a cystic ovarian neoplasm but no ovary could be identified. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the images CT of the same patient shows a multi-loculated cystic mass adjacent to the bladder, connected to the left ovarian vein (arrow). There are thick septations and irregular wall thickening. On the basis of this CT the distinction between a benign ovarian lesion such as as cystadenofibroma and a malignant ovarian lesion cannot be made. The lesion was resected and found to be a cystadenofibroma.
Malignant cystic ovarian neoplasms:
Remember, the role of imaging is not to determine the histological nature of a lesion, but to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and guide decisions on further management. The examples given here serve as a demonstration of suspicious imaging features, not as a guide for determination of histologic lesion type.
Serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma:
Ultrasound shows a complex solid-cystic mass in the left ovary, and another, very large complex solid-cystic mass in the right hemi-pelvis. CT of the same patient shows a complex solid-cystic mass with thick, enhancing septations in the right ovary. These findings are very suspicious for a malignant cystic neoplams. There is also bilateral lymphadenopathy (arrows). Pathology showed a serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma. This is the most common type of ovarian cancer.
Mucinous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma:
Ultrasound shows a very large multi-loculated cystic lesion in the region of the right adnex. Some locules are anechoic. Others contain uniform low-level echoes, consistent with proteineous content, such as hemorrhage or, in this case, mucin. The septations are thin, except for the dorsal septations that appear somewhat thicker, partially caused by the lower scanresolution at great depth.
The septations are avascular.
There are no solid components.
There was no ascites. Despite the absence of solid components and despite the absence of vascularity on color Doppler, the size and the multi-loculated aspect of this lesion are suspicious for a cystic neoplasm and warant further evaluation. The CECT shows similar findings.
The locules are of different attenuation, consistent with varying protein content. There is no ascites orperitoneal deposits and no lymphadenopathy. At pathology this was a mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of low malignant potential. Specimen of the mucinous cystadenocarcinoma The thin, relatively avascular septae, the absence of frank solid components, the absence of ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis and the absence of invasion, suggest a lesion of low malignant potential (LMP). Note however, that this diagnosis can not be made on imaging findings alone. Especially the absence of invasion in ovarian stroma cannot be judged reliably on imaging.
Endometrioid ovarian carcinoma:
On ultrasound both ovaries are markedly enlarged and contain cystic components with intracystic solid components (arrows). The complex solid-cystic lesions, in addition to being bilateral, are suspicious for a cystic ovarian neoplasm and warrant further evaluation. Again, the role of imaging is to confirm a lesion is present and to decide that this is not a lesion that can be classified as definitely benign nor a lesion that can be safely followed-up: action is required. CT of the same patient confirms large bilateral complex solid-cystic lesions, bulging into the abdomen. The purpose of the CT is not to confirm what was already known from the ultrasound, but to stage disease. On the basis of CT (or of MRI) it is not possible to determine the histologic type of the tumor. This is not relevant. This patient will undergo surgery. For epithelial tumors - by far the most common group of malignant ovarian tumors - even after surgery, the exact tumor subtype is much less important for the prognosis than factors such as FIGO-stage, tumor differentation grade, and how succesful surgery was in removing all of the disease. For this patient the relevant findings are on the image on the left. There is a peritoneal implant. The tumor was resected and pathology showed this was an endometrioid ovarian carcinoma.
Cystic metastases to the ovaries:
While metastases to the ovary are most commonly solid - such as for example Krukenbergs metastases - cystic ovarian metastases do occur. The CT image shows complex cystic masses in both ovaries. While a serous cystadenocarcinoma may very well be bilateral, they are more often unilocular than multilocular. Barely visible is part of a circumferential colorectal cancer (blue arrow). Clearly visible are cystic implants on the peritoneal reflection (red arrow).
These were cystic ovarian metastases of a colorectal cancer.

Angela Levy
Chief Gastrointestinal Radiology, Department of Radiologic Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington DC Associate Professor of Radiology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD:
Publicationdate 2009-08-28 This review is based on a presentation given by Angela Levy and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. We will discuss the differential diagnosis of cystic and solid peritoneal and mesenteric masses. In Peritoneum and Mesentery - part I: Anatomy 
 the normal anatomy and physiology of the peritoneum and peritoneal cavity are discussed. You can click on images to get an enlarged view. by Angela Levy
Differential Diagnosis:
Differential diagnosis of cystic peritoneal masses
Cystic masses:
The first step when diagnosing peritoneal or mesenteric masses is to separate them into cystic and solid. Secondly we have to realize that any loculated fluid collection due to infection, i.e. abscess or as a result of pancreatitis, perforation or bile peritonitis can simulate a cystic mass. Especially fluid collections in the lesser sac can simulate a cystic mass. Lastly we have to know which cystic masses are common and look for specific features of these masses. Other mesenteric cysts like enteric duplication cyst, enteric cyst, nonpancreatic pseudocyst and mesothelial cyst are very uncommon and have no specific features.
* Peritoneal inclusion cyst
 is a less common benign primary peritoneal tumor. 
It is also known as benign multicystic mesothelioma. This name is very confusing since there is no relation with the malignant mesothelioma.
It is seen in women with prior gynaecological surgery or infection. Differential diagnosis of solid peritoneal masses
Solid masses:
Usually there are omental metastases, i.e. omental cake and ascites.
* NHL and lymph node metastases
Are the most common diagnoses of a mesenteric mass. NHL is the most common cause of lymphadenopathy and usually there are other sites with lymphoma.
* Carcinoid
 Presents as a spiculated mesenteric mass often with a central calcification. It metastasize to the liver. There is associated bowel wall thickening due to a desmoplastic reaction.
* Sclerosing mesenteritis
 May look like carcinoid. There is a wide spectrum of presentations ranging from an infiltrative solid mass to the more common accidental finding also known as mesenteric panniculitis, which presents as a lipomatous mass, usually with no clinical implication.
* Mesenteric fibromatosis
 Is also known as intraabdominal fibromatosis, abdominal desmoid or desmoid tumor. It is a locally aggressive tumor which often recurs but does not metastasize. It can have a myxoid stroma resulting in a low attenuation on CT and a high attenuation on T2WI.
* Mesothelioma Accounts for 20% of all mesotheliomas and is associated with asbestos exposure and pleural plaques.
Cystic Masses:
Mucinous Carcinomatosis with a tumor nodule along the right paracolic gutter
Mucinous Carcinomatosis:
Mucinous carcinomatosis is the most common cystic tumor to affect the peritoneal cavity. Usually these metastases arise from mucinous carcinomas of the ovary or of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, colon, pancreas). The prognosis is poor. However, when low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix spreads to the peritoneal cavity, the consequence is typically pseudomyxoma peritonei, which is a distinct tumor with a better prognosis. In peritoneal carcinomatosis we see tumor nodules along the peritoneal lining (arrow), omental tumor deposits, and bowel obstruction. Pseudomyxoma peritonei with pronounced scalloping of the liver and almost destruction of the spleen. Notice the calcifications
Pseudomyxoma peritonei:
Pseudomyxoma peritonei is the result of a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix, which presents as a mucocele and spreads to the peritoneal cavity. It is a clinical syndrome, characterized by recurrent and recalcitrant voluminous mucinous ascites due to surface growth on the peritoneum without significant invasion of underlying tissues. A typical feature of pseudomyxoma peritonei is scalloped indentation of the surface of the liver and spleen. Unlike peritoneal metastases, there are no tumor nodules. There may be some calcifications. Pseudomyxoma peritonei with a little bit of scalloping and a mucocele of the appendix Pseudomyxoma peritonei (2) On the left another case of pseudomyxoma peritonei. There is hardly any scalloping of the liver. Notice the thickened falciform ligament. There is a mucocele of the appendix (arrow). This finding is only rarely seen. Pseudomyxoma peritonei with thickened mesentery (arrow) On the left another case of pseudomyxoma peritonei. There is compression of the mesentery resulting in a thickened cake-like hyperdense mesentery (arrow). There are also some calcifications. Pseudomyxoma peritonei is often confused with mucinous carcinomatosis. Unlike carcinomatosis it does not have true omental tumor deposits presenting as omental cake or peritoneal tumor deposits. Lymphangioma
Mesenteric cyst - Lymphangioma:
Mesenteric cyst is a descriptive term for any cystic lesion within the mesentery. Usually it is a lymphangioma. Other mesenteric cysts like enteric duplication cyst, enteric cyst, nonpancreatic pseudocyst and mesothelial cyst are very uncommon and have no specific features. Lymphangioma is a benign lesion of vascular origin. Most lymphangiomas are located in the neck, but 5% of lymphangiomas are abdominal. Lymphangioma has enhancing septa. Unlike in cystic peritoneal metastases, ascites is not a feature of lymphangioma. When you see a septated cystic lesion without ascites the most likely diagnosis is a lymphangioma. Lymphangioma Lymphangioma is often closely associated with the small bowel. At surgery it is usually very difficult to separate the tumor from the bowel and in many cases the bowel also has to be resected. The case on the left is also a lymphangioma. Notice that CT does not always appreciate the septations, although the specimen clearly shows multiple septations. Ultrasound or MR depict these septations better than CT. Enteric Duplication Cyst
Enteric Duplication Cyst:
Enteric duplication cyst is a cyst with a wall that has all three layers of the bowel wall, i.e. mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria. Although we commonly think of duplication cysts when we see a cystic mass adjacent to the bowel, we have to realize, that these are rare lesions.
They may occur anywhere in the mesentery, so either adjacent to or away from the bowel. On the left an enteric duplication cyst. It is located in the transverse mesocolon. This patient was suspected of having a cystic pancreatic tumor. The specimen demonstrates all the bowel wall layers.
Nonpancreatic Pseudocyst:
Nonpancreatic pseudocyst is a residual of an old hematoma or infection. Most of these patients have a history of prior abdominal trauma. Often there is a thickened wall and there can be some debris within the lesion. The patient on the left had had a car accident eight months before. This is probably an old mesenteric hematoma as a result of a lap belt injury. Notice the thickened wall on the CT and the debris on the ultrasound. On the left a specimen and CT image of a nonpancreatic pseudocyst. Notice the thick wall. Probably this is an old hematoma or abscess. You can suggest this diagnosis when you have a positive history and you see this thickened wall or debris.
Enteric cyst and mesothelial cyst:
These are also mesenteric cysts.
They are rare and have nonspecific imaging features.
The case on the left was diagnosed as a lymohangioma, simply because a lymphangioma is by far the most common mesenteric cyst.
At surgery this was a mesothelial cyst. Peritoneal Inclusion Cyst
Peritoneal Inclusion Cyst:
Also called Multilocular peritoneal inclusion cyst or Benign cystic mesothelioma. This is an uncommon benign primary peritoneal tumor that has no relation with the malignant mesothelioma. It occurs in premenopausal women with prior gynaecological surgery or infection that results in peritoneal scarring. The hormonally active ovaries secrete fluid that becomes loculated in the pelvis. The imaging features of a peritoneal inclusion cyst are non-specific except that it has to be located in the pelvis: On the left a transvaginal ultrasound demonstrating a multicystic pelvic lesion next to the uterus, which proved to be a peritoneal inclusion cyst. Peritoneal Inclusion Cyst with trapped ovary within septated fluid collection Sometimes the ovary is seen 'trapped' with the septate fluid collection (figure). Peritoneal inclusion cyst (2) When these peritoneal inclusion cysts become very large, they may extend into the upper abdomen as is seen in the case on the left. Notice that the left ovary is encircled by the cyst (arrow). There are also some enhancing septa. Peritoneal Inclusion Cyst Peritoneal inclusion cyst (3) On the left another example of a peritoneal inclusion cyst. There is a nice correlation between the MR and the specimen. Peritoneal inclusion cyst in a man extending into the upper abdomen Peritoneal inclusion cyst (4) On the left images of a male patient, who presented with a lower abdominal mass. There is a multi-cystic mass extending from the pelvis along the right paracolic gutter to the upper abdomen. In a male patient this is a very uncommon diagnosis. These images look quite similar to images of a pseudomyxoma peritonei which was discussed before. In peritoneal inclusion cysts however, you will not see scalloping of the surface of the liver.
Tuberculosis:
TB can produce very thick ascites, that can be loculated in distribution. Because of this, it can simulate a cystic lesion.. Usually there is accompanying abnormality of the terminal ileum and lymphadenopathy. The lymph nodes most often are of low attenuation (caseated). So these are the things to look for. On the left another image of the same patient. In TB the peritoneum is usually very thick (arrow). Echinococcal cyst with daughter cysts (arrows)
Echinococcal Cyst:
It is unusual for an echinococcal cyst to be located in the peritoneum. It favors the liver, the spleen and even the kidney over the peritoneum. On the left we see cysts in the peritoneum and in the spleen. Notice the daughter cysts as small dark lesions within the large peritoneal cyst (arrows). Echinococcal cysts In the pelvis additional echinococcal cysts are seen.
Solid Masses:
Omental cake (arrows) and ascites in a patient with peritoneal metastases
Peritoneal metastases:
Peritoneal metastases are the most common peritoneal solid masses. Gastrointestinal and ovarian cancers are the most common etiologies. Usually there are omental metastases, i.e. omental cake and ascites. On the left a CT demonstrating omental cake in a patient with ovarian cancer. Metastasis of a lung carcinoma presenting as a solitary solid peritoneal mass On the left a patient with a lung carcinoma. This solitary solid mass was found in the pelvis. Based on the history this was suspected to be a metastasis. Other solitary solid tumors like ... can have the same presentation. Biopsy is needed to make the diagnosis. This proved to be a metastasis of the lung carcinoma. NHL located in the small bowel mesentery
Lymphoma:
NHL is the most common cause of lymphadenopathy. Usually there are other sites with lymphoma. The CT attenuation at diagnosis is very homogeneous in most cases with minimal to no enhancement. Heterogeneous attenuation is seen only in cases with aggressive histology. During treatment the attenuation becomes heterogeneous as a result of necrosis and fibrosis. Calcification may occur. Carcinoid
Carcinoid:
Carcinoid is a slow-growing neuroendocrine tumour most commonly found in the small bowel. Less than 10% of patients with carcinoid will develop the carcinoid syndrome, caused by the overproduction of serotonin, which can lead to symptoms of cutaneous flushing, diarrhea and bronchoconstriction. Carcinoid metastasizes to the mesentery, which at times is easier to appreciate than the primary tumor in the small bowel. 
There is associated bowel wall thickening due to a desmoplastic reaction. On the left a patient with a typical carcinoid with central calcification (blue arrow). Notice the bowel retraction and wall thickening. There is a metastasis in the liver (yellow arrow). Positive octreoscan in a patient with carcinoid and liver metastases (blue arrows) On the left another patient with a carcinoid. The right image is the octreoscan, which is positive in 85% of carcinoids, so this can be a great help in the differential diagnosis. In this case we can also detect liver metastases on the scan (blue arrows). Notice that there is no activity of a primary tumor in the small bowel. This is often the case because the primary tumor can be quite small.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor - GIST:
Primary small bowel tumors can extend into the mesentery and the typical example of that is the GIST. You can have a large mesenteric component and such a small attachment to the bowel, that you may not appreciate it. On CT they are of mixed density due to necrosis and hemorrhage and they tend to be well vascularized, so they will enhance like the case on the left.
Inflammatory Pseudotumor:
This disease can affect lung, orbit and mesentery. Inflammatory pseudotumor is a diagnosis by exclusion. Usually the diagnosis is made at surgery or biopsy. It is the result of chronic inflammation with an unclear pathogenesis. Probably it is an occult infection due to minor trauma or post surgical. Mesenteric fibromatosis
Mesenteric fibromatosis - Desmoid:
Mesenteric fibromatosis is also known as intra-abdominal fibromatosis, abdominal desmoid or desmoid tumor. On the left a 33-year-old man who complains of an increasing abdominal girth, abdominal fullness, and a palpable abdominal mass. First study the images on the left and continue with the MR. Look for some imaging features that are helpful in the differential diagnosis. Mesenteric fibromatosiswith high signal on T2WI First of all this is a well circumscribed lesion with a low density on CT. There is some enhancement around the lesion and there are some small strands of enhancement within the lesion. On MR there is a low signal on T1 as we would expect. On T2 there is relatively high signal. In combination with the low density on CT this tells us that there is mucin within the lesion. This finding is very suggestive of the diagnosis of mesenteric fibromatosis. Mesenteric fibromatosis with Gadolinium enhancement Mesenteric fibromatosis - Desmoid (2) The enhancement on MR is more intense compared to the enhancement on CT. On CT the low density of the mucin stands out, but on MR we can appreciate the enhancement better. It tells us that the lesion is well vascularized. Mesenteric fibromatosis with a fibrous stroma Mesenteric fibromatosis or desmoid is a benign proliferative process that is locally aggressive and can recur, but it does not metastasize. The small bowel mesentery is the most common site. 13% of patients have familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). On the left images of another patient with mesenteric fibromatosis. Notice that this lesion is not of low attenuation. This lesion has a more collagenous or fibrous stroma. So there are two distinct patterns. Mesenteric fibromatosis - Desmoid (3) On the left again a more typical case with a low density tumor located in the greater omentum (upper image) and the gastrosplenic ligament (lower image). Mesenteric fibromatosis arising in the mesentery of a J-pouch in a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis On the left an unusual location, because normally there is no mesentery deep in the pelvis. This patient had familial adenomatous polyposis. A total colectomy with J-pouch of the ileum was performed. Now accompanying that J-pouch is mesentery in which mesenteric fibromatosis has developed. Notice the low attenuation foci or bands of myxoid stroma within the tumor. In familial adenomatous polyposis the mesenteric fibromatosis is almost always post operative and occurs at the operative sites. It frequently occurs at multiple sites including abdominal wall fibromatosis. These cases can be very aggressive. It usually comes back and when it does, it comes back as a more aggressive tumor. Therfore these patients are treated as conservatively as possible. Panniculitis mesenterialis
Sclerosing Mesenteritis:
This disease has multiple synonyms reflecting the wide histologic spectrum: mesenteric panniculitis, fibrosing mesenteritis and mesenteric lipodystrophy. Pathologically it is a chronic inflammation of unknown etiology. This entity is more common than previously thought. The signs and symptoms are variable. Patients present with pain, a palpable mass or bowel complications, but in many cases it is an incidental finding on CT made for other reasons. The image on the left is the form that we most frequently see in patients that are screened for other reasons. This form is mostly named panniculitis mesenterialis. In a more advanced stage you can have significant fibrosis resulting in retraction of the small bowel. Within these masses dystrophic calcifications can be seen as well as lucent areas of fat (arrow) Sclerosing mesenteritis (2) On the left a nice radiological pathological correlation. Notice the retraction of the bowel and also notice the resemblance to carcinoid. In these cases the octreoscan can be a great help in the differential diagnosis. These lesions are situated in the root of the mesentery and this makes a surgical procedure extremely difficult. These lesions are treated conservatively with immunosuppressiva, anti inflammatory drugs and sometimes anti-estrogens as long as possible.
Malignant mesothelioma:
Malignant mesothelioma is one of the primary peritoneal malignancies (Table on the left). Malignant mesothelioma Suggestive features are a sheet-like peritoneal thickening and absence of lymphadenopathy. Just like pleural mesothelioma, it is associated with asbestos exposure. On the left a patient with malignant mesothelioma. Notice the sheet-like thickening of the peritoneum. The diagnosis was suggested because of the pleural calcifications. Malignant mesothelioma Malignant mesothelioma (2) In advanced cases you will see encasement of the intra-peritoneal structures. In the case on the left there is besides encasement of the bowel and the liver, also encasement of the mesentery. On the left a rad-path correlation of the same case. Primary peritoneal serous carcinoma
Primary Peritoneal Serous Carcinoma:
This tumor is also one of the primary peritoneal malignancies.
It occurs exclusively in women. This tumor is histologically identical to malignant ovarian surface epithelial tumors. It was once thought to be very rare, but now almost one third of tumors previously diagnosed as ovarian cancer are diagnosed as primary peritoneal serous carcinoma. Consider this diagnosis when: As a radiologist you should consider this diagnosis if you think of metastatic ovarian cancer but the ovaries are normal. On the left a typical case. There is ascites and omental involvement, so your first thought is ovarian cancer, but the ovaries were normal. Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor
Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor:
This tumor is also one of the primary peritoneal malignancies. It is a rare malignancy of uncertain origin. It occurs primarily in young men with a mean age of 19 years. Consider this diagnosis if you see something that looks like peritoneal carcinomatosis in a young man that has no history of a primary malignancy. It is a very aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor begins as a dominant mass and then multiple masses occur within the peritoneum (figure). At this stage it is no different upon imaging to other tumors, however, the age of the patient provides the clue to the diagnosis. NHL would be number one in the differential diagnosis of these images. by Angela D. Levy, COL, MC, USA, Javier Arn?iz, MD, Janet C. Shaw, Lt Col, USAF, MC and Leslie H. Sobin, MD

Publicationdate 2007-5-1 0 This article is based on a presentation given by Gael Lonergan at the 'Teaching in Holland' course and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. In this overview we will discuss the following subjects: by Gael J. Lonergan
Testicular torsion:
Testicular torsion with twisted spermatic cord (arrow). Torsion occurs when an abnormally mobile testis twists on the spermatic cord, obstructing its blood supply. Patients present with acute onset of severe testicular pain. The ischemia can lead to testicular necrosis if not corrected within 5-6 hours of the onset of pain. Torsion can be intermittent and can undergo spontaneous detorsion. In a child with an acute scrotum, testicular torsion is not the most common condition (Table). Torsion of testicular appendices represents the more common cause of scrotal pain. Typically, it has a more gradual onset than testicular torsion and patients may endure pain for several days before seeking medical attention. Testicular appendage torsion Testicular appendage torsion appears as a lesion of low echogenicity with a central hypoechogenic area adjacent to the epididymis. Most of the time however, we don't see it and we do the US just to exclude a testicular torsion. We should see torsion of testicular appendices more as a diagnosis of exclusion. So although torsion of the testicular appendix and epididymitis are more common, our goal is mainly to detect or exclude a testicular torsion. We want to be able to tell the surgeon whether or not it is a surgical emergency. Testicular torsion: Optimal setting for color on normal side, followed by examination of symptomatic side.
Color doppler:
Complete absence of intratesticular blood flow and normal extratesticular blood flow on color Doppler images is diagnostic, if the flow is normal in the contralateral testis.
Yet, the presence of flow within the testis does not exclude the presence of torsion, because incomplete vascular obstruction can sometimes occur or intermittent torsion. The case on the left shows a testicular torsion of the left testis. This case is very obvious because there is no flow on the affected side, but also a difference in echogenicity. With prolonged torsion, the testis is typically hypoechoic and inhomogeneous and is often accompanied by a surrounding hydrocele.
By the time these sonographic findings occur, surgical salvage of the testicle is unlikely. Use at least a 10 MHz linear transducer. Always start with the examination of the normal side and optimize the settings for low flow, low resistance and low velocity. The background 'noise' should just be visible in the asymptomatic testis. Once you have a good image of the normal side, don't touch any of the settings' and go to the symptomatic side. Small testis in a very young child, difficult to differentiate from the surrounding fat In the very young child it can be difficult to examine the testes because they are very small and mobile. The prepubertal testis has a volume of about 1-2 cc, while the postpubertal testis has about 30cc. With age the testis increases in echogenicity, so in a very young child the small testis can be difficult to differentiate from the surrounding fat, especially if it is retracted into the inguinal canal (figure). At the start of the examination you can put your finger on the inguinal canal, so that the testis can not move around.
Color Doppler imaging has limited sensitivity for detecting blood flow in pediatric patients with a testicular volume of less than 1cc. Two cases of torsio testis. On the left two more cases. On the far left a child of 10 months old with torsio testis. There is more flow in the tissues around the testis than in the testis itself and that is abnormal, unless the child has cellulitis. The case next to it is an older child. The gray scale ultrasound shows an abnormal testis. So this could be torsio or orchitis, but the absent flow tells us, that this definitely is a torsio testis.
Presentation:
The testis is usually elevated as a result of the torsion and the shortening of the cord itself and may be in a transverse lie. The affected side can be larger from the swollen testis itself, a hydrocele or skin thickening.
Gray scale Ultrasound:
Gray scale ultrasound is helpfull, not in making the diagnosis, but in predicting the outcome. For the first 4-6 hours there is a normal architecture. During this period the testis is salvagable, so a normal appearance on gray scale means good outcome. After this period the testis becomes heterogeneous and enlarged over the next 4-24 hours and the epididymis and scrotal wall may swell and become hypoechoic. A worsening appearance of the testis on gray scale US correlates with decreased viability (1). A difference in echogenicity means poor outcome. The way to look at differences in echogenicity, is to get a transverse image of both testes. The images on the left show the affected side to be bigger and more echogenic. This testis is probably not salvagable. The testis may appear more echogenic or less echogenic, it doesn't matter, as long as there is a difference, there is a poor outcome.
Epididymitis:
Epididymitis is the most common inflammatory process involving the scrotum and more common in adults. Infections generally originate in the lower urinary tract from the bladder, urethra or prostate and are typically caused by urinary tract pathogens or sexually transmitted organisms (Chlamydia or gonorrrhhea) . Epididymitis also occurs in children, but is then due to infection with Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. In urinary tract abnormalities also infection with E.Coli is seen. A sterile chemical epididymitis can result from reflux of sterile urine through the ejaculatory ducts, for instance if the ureter inserts in the prostatic urethra, this may lead to increased pressure in the vas deferens. . On the left a child with a meningocele who had epididymitis. Due to increased bladder pressure and contractions against a closed sphincter, there was reflux not only into the left ureter and porstate, but also into the epididymis, which resulted in epididymitis. The case on the left shows the typical features of epididymitis. The epididymis is swollen and heterogeneous. There is a hydrocele and scrotal wall thickening. With color doppler there is increased flow. A normal epididymis has only limited colorflow.
Orchitis:
Orchitis is characterized by focal, peripheral, hypoechoic testicular lesions that are poorly defined, amorphous, or crescent-shaped. Orchitis also exhibits testicular hyperemia on color Doppler sonography images and is usually accompanied by epididymal hyperemia due to concomitant epididymitis. A reactive hydrocele is also frequently associated with epididymoorchitis. Focal testicular infarction can occur as a complication of epididymitis when swelling of the epididymis is severe enough to constrict the testicular blood supply. This appears as a hypoechoic intratesticular mass devoid of blood flow. The complications of orchitis are abscess formation and ischemia. The case on the left is a young patient, who came a week before with a hyperemic testis and epididymitis. Due to ongoing infection, the pressure within the testis increased leading to infarction. This is not due to torsion, but can be easily mistaken for torsion. On the left two cases with abnormal areas within the testis probably due to absces formation.
Trauma:

Hematocele:
In trauma there is either a hematocele or testicular hematoma. In the acute phase the hemorrhage is echogenic and in the chronic phase it is hypoechoic. A hematocele results from scrotal or intra-abdominal hemorrhage. It represents bleeding between the leaves of the tunica vaginalis and appears as a complex fluid collection. With time, this collection can develop loculations, which appear as thick septations. It is important to be able to tell if the testis is intact, because if there is a rupture, this can sometimes be treated surgically. On the left a patient with a typical hematocele.
Testicular rupture:
Testicular rupture is seen as focal alterations of testicular echogenicity correlating with areas of intratesticular hemorrhage or infarction in a patient with a hematocele. A discrete fracture plane is identified in fewer than 20% of cases, although visible alterations in the testicular contour are a common finding. On the left a complicated case. The ultrasound demonstrated a large hematocele. There was doubt whether the echogenic structure indeed was a testis. MR was performed and no testicular tissue was found, so we have to conclude that the echogenic structure is a result of fresh hematoma. On the left another patient with a rupture, that was seen on the abdominal CT. On US there was a large heterogeneous area with no identifiable testis due to rupture.
Hernia:
LEFT: herniated bowel in preterm.RIGHT: left-sided hernia in constipated child due to intermitted herniation of sigmoid. Hernias in children are common especially in premature infants. Sometimes we can see them on plain films as we see in the case on the left. If they are filled with bowel, they are easy to detect, but sometimes these hernias are only filled with soft tissue Longitudinal view of inguinal canal. The herniated bowel is seen next to the testis (arrow). The ultrasound examination starts with the child lying down and is then continued in the standing position. The bowel or omentum is visible separate from the testis (figure). The intestinal loop descends through the unclosed processus vaginalis. An incarcerated hernia is a cause of acute scrotal pain. Peristalsis suggests viability and absence of peristalsis is worrisome for incarceration.
Idiopathic Scrotal Edema:
Idiopathic scrotal edema is seen in school-aged boys. They present with scrotal skin swelling. So the clinical question is, if there is torsion or infection. At examination the testes and epididymes are normal and all that we see on US is skin edema. If this is all we see and the child does not have fever or elevated white count, which can be seen in cellulitis, than we can make the diagnosis of Idiopathic scrotal edema. Although this is an idiopathic disease, so we don't know what it is, it is nevertheless important to make this diagnosis. It is far more reasuring for parents to be told, that their child has a specific diagnosis, that it is benign and will go away with time. That is better, than telling them, that you don't know what it is, but it is no torsion, so you don't really worry about it. J US Med 1997; 16: 23.

Traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage:
Amber Bucker, Henriette Westerlaan, Aryan Mazuri, Maarten Uyttenboogaart and Robin Smithuis
University Medical Center Groningen and Alrijne Hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Any type of bleeding inside the skull or brain is a medical emergency.
The most common causes of hemorrhage are trauma, haemorrhagic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm.
Complications are increased intracerebral pressure as a result of the hemorrhage itself, surrounding edema or hydrocephalus due to obstruction of CSF. In this article we will discuss traumatic hemorrhages.
Non-traumatic hemorrhages are discussed here. Press ctrl+ for larger images and text on a PC or ⌘+ on a Mac.
Most images can be enlarged by clicking on them.
Localization of hemorrhage:
Extra-axial hemorrhage -Intracranial extracerebral Intra-axial hemorrhage - intracerebral
Anatomy of the meninges:
Meninges are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord: the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. 
Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. Dura mater is the outermost meningeal layer that covers the brain and spinal cord.
It consists of two layers: the inner meningeal layer and the outer periosteal layer. Arachnoid is a layer with delicate fibres which extend down through the subarachnoid space and attach to the pia mater.
Arachnoid granulations - also called Pacchionian granulations - are small protrusions of the arachnoid mater through the outer membrane of the dura mater into the dural venous sinuses of the brain, and allow cerebrospinal fluid  to exit the subarachnoid space and enter the blood stream. Pia mater is the innermost layer covering the brain. 
The pia mater allows blood vessels to pass through and nourish the brain.
The arachnoid and pia mater together are sometimes called the leptomeninges.
Traumatic hemorrhage:

Epidural hematoma:
An epidural hematoma is a bleeding that occurs between the dura and the skull.
It is mostly seen in children who have a head injury with fracture of the temporal bone resulting in tearing of the middle meningeal artery. In theory an epidural hematoma can cross the midline because it is located between the dura and the skull.
However since the dura is tightly adherent to the adjacent skull near suture lines, an epidural hematoma usually does not cross suture lines. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll A  11 year-old boy fell off his bike probably due to an epileptic convulsion.
He hit the curb with his head.  
His level of consciousness was lowered and his EMV score was 2-4-3.
He presented with bradycardia, hypertension, abnormal posturing and  a non-reactive dilated right pupil, which are all signs of brain herniation and raised intracranial pressure. CT findings A craniotomy was performed subsequently and  the torn middle meningeal artery was coagulated. Clinical outcome was good.
Subdural hematoma:
A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the inner layer of the dura and the arachnoid.
It cannot cross the midline, but can be located near dural folds like the falx or the tentorium. It usually results from rupture of the cortical bridging veins.
It usually occurs in head trauma and especially in patients who are treated with antcoagulantia. It is most common in elderly and alcoholics with atrophy. 
In brain atrophy the venous subdural structures are less well “packed” against the skull, which give them more space to move and possibility to torn. This patient has an acute subdural hematoma.
There is midline shift (left image). The patient was operated and the hematoma was evacuated (right image). The images show a subdural hematoma. Notice that the hematoma has both hyperdense and isodense  areas. This can be seen in hyperacute bleeding, but can also be seen in rebleeding. There is displacement of midline structures with obstruction of CSF flow resulting in dilatation of the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle (arrow). An acute subdural hematoma is hyperdens (clotted blood), a subacute hematoma is isodens and a chronic subdural hematoma appears hypodens to brain parenchyma (isodens to CSF). Sign of active bleedingIn the acute setting, a subdural hematoma can appear heterogenous, because of the mixed components of the hemorrhage: fresh in flow of non clotted blood (hypodens) and clotted blood (hyperdens). Subacute isodense subdural hematoma(3-21 days). Isodense subdural hematoma As a subdural hematoma ages, the density of the hematoma will decrease and may be the same as the density of the brain, which make it difficult to detect the hematoma. Here a case of an isodense subdural hematoma which is very hard to detect (arrows). Notice that on a higher level there is a bilateral subdural hematoma. In rare cases an acute subdural hematoma may be isodense to the brain. This is seen in patients with severe anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or if the hematoma is diluted with cerebrospinal fluid (ref). When a chronic subdural hematoma (> 21 days) becomes hypodens to parenchyma and isodens to CSF, it may mimick a hygroma. A hygroma is the result of a traumatic torn in the arachnoid layer which causes CSF to leak to the subdural space,. A subdural hematoma can spread along the falx and tentorium as seen in this case.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage:
The images show hyperdense blood in the subarachnoid space of the Sylvian fissure (yellow arrow). Notice the subgaleal hemorrhage in the right occipital region (blue arrow). This is a coupe contrecoupe type of injury. This is another coupe contrecoupe type of injury with contusional hemorrhages and a subdural hematoma in the left frontal lobe near the skull base (red arrow). There is a subarachnoid hemorrhage on the right with a fracture of the parietal bone (yellow arrow). Enable Scroll

Diffuse Axonal Injury:
High-impact trauma with acceleration-deceleration forces, especially rotational acceleration, can lead to stretching and deformation of the brain tissue, resulting in DAI.
CT has a low sensitivity for detecting DAI. In closed traumatic brain injury with no traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage DAI is unlikely. A 46 year-old man had a high energy trauma with his motorcycle. 
The initial EMV score was 2-5-3 and his pupils were non-reactive and dilated. CT findings Continue with the MRI images... Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll MRI was requested because of persisting cognitive deficits. MRI findings In closed traumatic brain injury with no traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage  a DAI is unlikely.
DAI can be diagnosed accurately conventional MRI, including T2*GRE or SWI. 
The presence of DAI on MRI in patients with traumatic brain injury results in a higher chance of unfavourable functional outcome. Three stages can be distinguished on MRI: With MRI grading, the odds ratio for unfavourable functional outcome increases threefold with every grade.
Lesions in the corpus callosum in particular are associated with an unfavourable functional outcome. This patient has an intracerebral hemorrhage as a result of a stabwound. Enable Scroll

Duret hemorrhage:
A 54-year-old man, who was treated with anticoagulants after aortic valve replacement, developed severe headache after being hit  by a ball. 
The following day his condition worsened with loss  of consciousness, respiratory distress and a non-reactive dilated left pupil. 
The initial CT of his head showed an acute subdural hemorrhage along the left convexity with subfalcine and uncal herniation. The hemorrhage was evacuated surgically. Postoperatively the CT showed an acute bleeding within the brainstem, which had a lethal outcome. This brain stem hemorrhage is called a Duret hemorrhage. 
They are small linear areas of bleeding in the midbrain and upper pons of the brainstem caused by a traumatic downward displacement of the brainstem with parahippocampal gyrus herniation through the tentorial hiatus. by Sara Shams, MD et al. Cerebrovasc Dis. 2016

Small Bowel Tumors:
Rinze Reinhard and Gerdien Kramer
Radiology department of the VU medical centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2014-05-21 Small bowel tumours are rare, accounting for 3-6% of gastrointestinal tumors. The clinical presentation is non-specific. Symptoms include anemia, gastro-intestinal bleeding, abdominal pain or small bowel obstruction. In this article we will focus on the four most common small bowel malignancies: The differential diagnosis will be discussed.
Overview:
The table shows the features of the most common malignant small bowel tumors. Click on the table to enlarge the image. FAP is an inherited condition in which numerous adenomatous polyps form.
* MEN-1 syndrome Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 or Wermer's syndrome is a syndrome in which endocrine tumors can develop including carcinoid.
Adenocarcinoma:
Adenocarcinoma represents 25-40% of all small bowel neoplasms. However coloncarcinoma is 50 times more common. 50% of small bowel adenocarcinomas occur in the duodenum and most of these are found with endoscopy. The jejunum is the second most prevalent site. Risk factors: Study the coronal reconstructed CT-image. Then continue reading. The findings are: The typical imaging representation of a small bowel adenocarcinoma is a focal unilocular, circumferential mass with shouldering of the margins and obstruction. Less frequently adenocarcinomas present as an intraluminal polypoid mass, which can lead to intussusception. Ulceration is a quite common feature. Extraluminal infiltration can present as fatstranding. Here another example of a duodenal carcinoma presenting as irregular wall thickening in the distal duodenum (arrows). Adenocarcinomas often show moderate enhancement, while carcinoid tumors show bright enhancement. Metastases to the liver and peritoneum occur frequently. The images show a circumferential mass with shouldering of the margins. Adenocarcinoma in the jejunum Large adenocarcinomas can mimic a lymphoma as in this case. The images show an irregular mass in the proximal jejunum. Although it is a large circumferential growing mass, the lumen is not obstructed. There is a large conglomerate of hypodense lymph nodes in the adjacent mesentery, consistent with necrotic lumph node metastases (lower image). This proved to be an adenocarcinoma, but these findings could very well represent a lymphoma. Here the endoscopic image of the tumor. Here a patient with extensive wall thickening of the proximal jejunum with aneurysmatic dilatation. On top of our differential diagnostic list would be a lymphoma, but this proved to be an adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma in the jejunum Features that favour adenocarcinoma are fat stranding due to mesenteric fat infiltration and lymph node metastases. In lymphoma fat stranding is uncommon, but lymph node metastases do occur and are usually more bulky. The images show a short obstructing circular mass in the jejunum (yellow arrow) with enlarged lymph node (red arrow). This proved to be an adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma in the jejunum Post-contrast T1W-image with fatsat (left) and T2W-image (right) show an obstructing mass in the jejunum with shouldering (arrow). There is prestenotic dilatation. Top images show a circular mass in the proximal jejunum with FDG uptake (yellow arrows). Lower MR-images show the same jejunal mass with shouldered borders and mesenteric lymphadenopathy (red arrows), consistent with adenocarcinoma. First study the images. Then continue reading. The red arrow indicates the sigmoid, which is filled with feces. So this is not a small bowel feces sign. The findings are: One could consider the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. However this patient was not known with Crohn's disease and the terminal ileum (not shown) was normal, which would be uncommon. At surgery this proved to be an adenocarcinoma. Here an adenocarcinoma in the proximal jejunum. The mass is better depicted with MRI than with CT. Adenocarcinoma in Crohn's disease As mentioned before 50% of small bowel adenocarcinomas occur in the duodenum. These tumors are mostly found with endoscopy. The jejunum is the second most prevalent site. Occurrence in the ileum is often related to Crohn's disease as in this case. There is a thickened wall of the ileum with adjacent mesenteric infiltration with foci of extraluminal air indicating perforation. This proved to be an ulcerating adenocarcinoma in a patient with M. Crohn. The diagnosis is seldom made pre-operatively due to lack of typical imaging features. The risk is related to the duration and anatomical extent of the disease and develops in the terminal ileum, in the region of active Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease with stenosis but no carcinoma. Here a patient with active Crohn's disease, who has a stenotic segment in the terminal ileum. This patient does not have an adenocarcinoma. The findings are: Here another adenocarcinoma located in the jejunum. There are multiple lymph nodes (red arrow) and there is fat stranding (yellow arrows). It should not be mistaken for mesenteric panniculitis as these large necrotic lymph nodes are pathologic.
Lymphoma:
Lymphoma in the terminal ileum Lymphomas make up about 20 % of all small bowel tumors. The distal ileum is the most common site, owing to the large amount of lymphoid tissue that is present in the distal ileum. Risk factors include celiac disease, Crohn's disease, SLE, immunocompromised state and a history of chemotherapy or extra-intestinal lymphoma. The typical presentation of a small bowel lymphoma is a thick walled infiltrating mass with aneurysmal dilatation without obstruction. Aneurysmal dilatation is based upon destruction of the bowel wall and the myenteric nerve plexus. Here a typical presentation (figure). There is irregular wall thickening of the terminal ileum with aneurysmatic dilatation. Lymphoma in the proximal jejunum A less common presentation is as an intraluminal polypoid mass or a large excentric mass with extension into the surrounding soft tissues with possible ulceration and formation of fistulas. As mentioned before, large adenocarcinomas and lymphomas can have similar imaging appearances. Bulky mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are findings that support the diagnosis of a lymphoma. Infiltration of the mesenteric fat favours the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma. Here a typical lymphoma presenting as a large thick walled mass in the proximal jejunum with FDG uptake. Dilated lumen at the site of the mass and prestenotic dilatation of the duodenum (red arrow) First study the images and take special notice of the first image. Then continue reading. The findings are: EATL Here another patient with celiac disease. There is an irregular mass in the jejunum with luminal dilatation. There is infiltration of the mesentery. Pathology showed a T-cell lymphoma in celiac disease. This is called enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma or EATL. This is a type of T-cell lymphoma that affects the small intestine in patients with celiac disease. EATL lymphoma in a patient with celiac disease. Here another example of a T-cell lymphoma in celiac disease.
Carcinoid tumor:
Small intraluminal mass in the ileum (yellow arrow). Associated spiculated mesenteric mass with adjacent desmoplastic reaction in small bowel carcinoid. Carcinoid tumors are rare neuroendocrine tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors of the small can be divided in well-differentiated - also known as carcinoid and poorly differentiated - small or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Here we will discuss the carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors constitute 2% of all gastrointestinal tumors. The incidence of carcinoid tumors increased over the last decades, exceeding that of adenocarcinoma, making it the most common small bowel malignancy. The most common location of a carcinoid is the appendix, usually as an incidental finding following appendectomy. It is uncommon to diagnose a carcinoid of the appendix on imaging studies. These images are of a patient who presented with peritoneal metastases. The primary tumor proved to be a carcinoid of the appendix. The second most common location is the distal ileum. The stomach, colon and rectum are rare locations. Small bowel carcinoids are multiple in about one third of cases. There is an association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I). Here a typical carcinoid presenting as a large mesenteric mass with desmoplastic reaction and retraction of adjacent small bowel loops with wall thickening (arrows). Carcinoid with calcification and desmoplastic reaction. Obstructive small bowel ileus based on intraluminal component of carcinoid. Note small liver metastasis (arrow). Carcinoid metastases The likelihood of metastases is related to the size of the tumor. For example, the incidence of nodal and liver metastases is approximately 20-30% in patients with carcinoid tumors smaller than 1 cm but increases to almost 60-80% for nodal metastases and 20% for liver metastases when tumors are 1-2 cm. In patients with primary tumors greater than 2 cm, the incidence of nodal metastases is 80% and of liver metastases is 40-50%. Liver metastases are usually hypervascular and can show central necrosis. Most of the lymph node metastases show calcifications, similar to the primary tumor. Multiple livermetastases of a carcinoid tumor. Same patient. Four years after the initial CT multiple liver metastases are seen. Notice hypervascular enhancement pattern in the late arterial phase. Carcinoid syndrome The carcinoid syndrome occurs in approximately 5% of carcinoid tumors and becomes manifest when vasoactive substances from the tumors enter the systemic circulation. It commonly occurs in patients who have liver metastases. Symptoms include flushing and diarrhea and less frequently bronchospasm and heart failure. The heart failure is the result of serotonin-induced fibrosis of the cardiac valves, notably the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. The images show a carcinoid tumor presenting as a hypervascular mass (red arrow) with desmoplastic reaction (yellow arrow). Carcinoid presenting as hyperenhancing lesion in the late arterial phase Carcinoid tumors are slowly growing tumors that may go unrecognized for many years. They start as small submucosal lesions (images). As the carcinoid grows, thickening of the bowel wall occurs, leading eventually to extension outside the bowel wall. Carcinoid tumors can cause an intense desmoplastic reaction with retraction of bowel loops and fibrosis, sometimes leading to bowel ischemia. However, when the carcinoid is small the findings are non-specific. It can present as a small submucosal nodule with arterial enhancement (image) and sometimes they lead to intussusception.
GIST:
Typical GIST in the ileum presenting as an exophytic tumor. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are mesenchymal tumors and represent 9% of all small bowel tumors. These tumors most frequently occur in the stomach, followed by jejunum and ileum. Occurrence in colon, rectum, esophagus and appendix is rare. About 20-30 % of GIST's are malignant at presentation. In the small bowel they are more often malignant than in the stomach. Tumors smaller than 2 cm are usually benign, whereas masses larger than 5 cm are often malignant. Malignant GIST's predominantly grow extraluminally and can show necrosis, hemorrhage, calcification (post therapy) and fistula formation. Typically a GIST is a well defined and exophytic mass with heterogeneous enhancement and a clear delineation from the mesentery. An intraluminal mass is far less common. Obstruction is rare because GISTs do not involve the circumferential bowel wall, in contrast to adenocarcinoma. Unlike carcinoid tumors, the primary lesion in a GIST is large. Both GIST and lymphoma can show aneurysmal dilation of the bowel. Liver metastases are usually hypervascular and can be missed on a single portal venous phase CT. Lymph node metastases are generally not seen. If lymphadenopathy is seen, you should consider another diagnosis. Mesenteric or omental metastases are more common in recurrent disease than at first presentation. This is thought to be due to spill of tumor during surgery. These metastases can be easily missed, as they often have a low-density center. After chemotherapy (Imatinib or Gleevec), the liver and mesenteric metastases become hypovascular or even cystic. Despite radical surgical resection, 40-90 % of patients have recurrence of disease in liver or mesentery. Gleevec can be given in case of metastatic disease. Disease recurrence in resected GIST showing hypodense livermetastases and a large heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis.
Differential diagnosis:
The differential diagnosis of small bowel tumors includes many infectious and inflammatory diseases, that all present with focal bowel wall thickening. The most common small bowel tumors are metastases, which are more common than primary malignancies. Multiple intraluminal metastases in a patient with a history of melanoma.
Metastases:
The spread of metastases to the small bowel can be intraperitoneal, hematogenous, lymphatic or by direct extension. Most common (50%) is intraperitoneal seeding. This is mostly seen in primary tumors originating from ovary, appendix and colon. Metastatic cells implant on the mesenteric border of the bowel. Hematogenous metastases usually occur in breast carcinoma, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. They can be polypoid and can cause intussusception. Here a patient with metastatic melanoma. Left image shows ileal-ileal intussusception due to metastasis. Right image shows intussusception in coronal plane as well as an enlarged mesenteric lymph node (yellow arrow) and extensive liver metastases. Another patient with a small bowel metastasis. This patient had a history of colon- and esophaguscarcinoma. This patient has multiple intraluminal small bowel masses (yellow arrows), which appeared to be metastases from an unknown primary. Also note the intussusception (red arrow) en soft tissue metastasis in the left gluteus muscle (blue arrow). History of ileocecal resection. Focal ileal wall thickening with some enhancement in Crohn's disease.
Crohn's disease:
Wall thickening in inflammatory or infectious small bowel disease should be differentiated from malignant wall thickening. Distinguishing features of inflammation (Crohn's disease) are ulcerations, increased mesenteric vessels (comb sign), skip lesions and increased surrounding fat (creeping fat). An association between Crohn's disease and small bowel adenocarcinoma is well-established. Differentiating these two is challenging pre-operatively when there are no typical imaging features. An indicator of malignancy is a small bowel obstruction that is refractory to medical therapy. Crohn's disease with multiple lesions (arrows). Active Crohn's disease. Long segment of ileal wall thickening with comb sign and transmural enhancement.
Sclerosing or fibrosing mesenteritis:
Sclerosing or fibrosing mesenteritis develops in the mesentery and can be mass-like and mimic a malignant tumor like a carcinoid. In these cases sclerosing mesenteritis can be differentiated by the 'fat ring sign',which means there is preservation of fat surrounding the mesenteric vessels.
Desmoid:
Desmoid is a rare, benign, locally aggressive mass composed of fibrous tissue. It is the most common primary tumor of the mesentery and can mimic a malignant bowel- or mesenteric neoplasm. Most desmoids are sporadic tumors, but some occur in the setting of Gardner syndrome. There is often a history of previous abdominal surgery. Desmoid tumors do not metastasize, but do tend to recur. The high recurrence rate favors the use of nonsurgical therapy. Mesenteric desmoids usually show minimal enhancement. Small bowel or mesenteric vessels can be displaced or encased. Because these tumors can be very hard, percutaneous biopsy can be challenging.
Adenomas:
Adenomas are pre-cancerous lesions that can present as polypoid pedunculated masses on a stalk, a sessile mass (no stalk) or a mural based nodule within the mucosa. Lesions show homogeneous enhancement and are usually nonobstructive. Extraserosal extension is suggestive of malignant degeneration. Here a patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome with multiple small bowel polyps, mainly located in jejunum. Patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome with ileal polyp as leadpoint for intussusception.
Polyposis syndromes:
Intestinal polyposis syndromes can be divided into the broad categories of familial adenomatous polyposis (like Gardner syndrome), hamartomatous polyposis syndromes (like Peutz-Jeghers syndrome) and other rare polyposis syndromes. Patients with these syndromes often have multiple small bowel polyps. Larger polyps can become malignant and can mimic primary small bowel neoplasms. Here a patient with Peutz-Jeghers, who has multiple polyps in the jejunum. The largest polyp in this patient was removed endoscopically. PA proven hemangioma: coronal T1 FS post contrast and coronal T2 show enhancing well defined intraluminal jejunal mass..
Hemangioma:
Most intestinal hemangiomas are located in the jejunum. They can be sessile or pedunculated and they usually show nodular arterial enhancement and homogeneous enhancement in the delayed phase.
Leiomyoma:
Leiomyomas are rare mesenchymal benign tumors. The origin may be intraluminal, submucosal or extraluminal. Benign imaging features include sharp margins, homogeneous aspect and homogeneous enhancement.
Lipomas:
These are well-circumscribed intraluminal masses with fat attenuation. Liposarcoma of the small bowel is extremely rare. CT shows a lesion with fat attenuation at duodenal-jejunal junction. Low signal intensity of the mass on MR T2 fatsat (right lower image). Endoscopic view of lipoma (right upper image).
Mesenteric ischemia:
Target sign due to ischemic small bowel segment. Note mesenteric edema and ascites. Target sign A target sign is a result of submucosal edema surrounded by enhancing mucosa and muscularis. It is a benign sign and is usually due to inflammation, ischemia or radiation enteritis.
Typhlitis:
Target sign in a patient with neutropenic sepsis, consistent with enterocolitis. Neutropenic enterocolitis is a life-threatening, necrotizing enterocolitis and occurs most commonly in individuals with hematologic malignancies who are neutropenic and have breakdown of gut mucosal integrity as a result of cytotoxic chemotherapy (8). "Typhlitis" (from the Greek word "typhlon," or cecum) describes neutropenic enterocolitis of the ileocecal region; we prefer the more inclusive term, "neutropenic enterocolitis," since other parts of the smalland/or large intestine are often involved (8).
Technique:
Small bowel tumors can be detected on standard abdominal CT in patients with non-specific symptoms However if the CT findings are unclear or if a small bowel tumor is suspected clinically, CT-enterography or MRI-enterography or enteroclysis is performed. Both MRI and CT have good performance for the diagnosis of small bowel tumors. The choice mainly depends on personal preferences. We prefer MRI enteroclysis as tumors are often well depicted in the dilated bowel loops without use of radiation. For MR enterography and enteroclysis fluid (water or methylcellulose) is the enteric contrast media with low signal on T1-weighted images and high signal on T2-weighted images. Here we see a coronal T2W-image and a coronal T1W-image with fatsat. Notice that the small bowel is well distended. Luminal distension should be ≥ 2 cm. Bowel wall thickness > 3 mm is considered abnormal. Collapsed small bowel loops can be easily misinterpreted as wall thickening or abnormal enhancement. On the coronal T1W-image the jejunal loops are collapsed. As a result it looks as if there is bowel wall thickening and prominant enhancement. On the T2W-image during the same examination there is normal distention. PET-CT is not first choice, but can be useful if findings on CT or MR are equivocal or to look for metastatic disease. G.

Pulmonary nodule - Benign versus Malignant:

Differentiation with CT and PET-CT:
Ann Leung and Robin Smithuis
Department of Radiology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California and the Department of Radiology, Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2007-05-20 A solitary pulmonary nodule is defined as a discrete, well-marginated, rounded opacity less than or equal to 3 cm in diameter that is completely surrounded by lung parenchyma, does not touch the hilum or mediastinum, and is not associated with adenopathy, atelectasis, or pleural effusion. Lesions larger than 3 cm are considered masses and are treated as malignancies until proven otherwise. The differential diagnosis of a solitary pulmonary nodule is broad and management depends on whether the lesion is benign or malignant. In this overview we will discuss some of the new features that can help to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules based upon CT and PET-CT findings.
CT: benign versus malignant:
Benign pattern of calcification
Calcification:
Diffuse, central, laminated or popcorn calcifications are benign patterns of calcification. These types of calcification are seen in granulomatous disease and hamartomas. All other patterns of calcification should not be regarded as a sign of benignity. The exception to the rule above is when patients are known to have a primary tumor. For instance the diffuse calcification pattern can be seen in patients with osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma. Similarly the central and popcorn pattern can be seen in patients with GI-tumors and patients who previously had chemotherapy. Relationship between SPN-size and chance of malignancy in patients with high risk for lung cancer
Size:
A solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is defined as a single intraparenchymal lesion less than 3 cm in size and not associated with atelectasis or lymphadenopathy. A lesion greater than 3 cm in diameter is called a mass. This distinction is made, because lesions greater than 3 cm are usually malignant, while smaller lesions can be either benign or malignant. Swensen et al studied the relationship between the size of a SPN and the chance of malignancy in a cohort at high risk for lung cancer (1). Their findings are listed in the table on the left. They concluded that benign nodule detection rate is high, especially if lesions are small. Of the over 2000 nodules that were less than 4 mm in size, none was malignant.
Growth:
Comparison with prior imaging studies is often the most useful procedure to determine the importance of the finding of a SPN, since stability over 2 years is highly associated with benignity. Transverse image (left) and coronal reconstruction (right)Three-dimensional ratio = transverse dimension : vertical dimension
Shape:
Japanese screening studies showed that a polygonal shape and a three-dimensional ratio > 1.78 was a sign of benignity (2,3). A polygonal shape means that the lesion has multiple facets (multi-sided). A peripheral subpleural location was also a sign of benignity in this study. The three-dimensional ratio is measured by obtaining the maximal transverse dimension and dividing it by the maximal vertical dimension. A large three-dimensional ratio indicates that the lesion is relatively flat, which is a benign sign. Corona radiata sign in a malignant lesion with spiculation at the margin.
Margin:
Air bronchogram sign seen in
Air Bronchogram sign:
Recent studies have showed that an air bronchogram is more commonly seen in malignant pulmonary nodules. It is most commonly seen in BAC (bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma) and adenocarcinoma. The case on the left shows an airbronchogram seen as a linear lucency (broad arrow) and as a more cystic lucency (small arrow) due to the fact that the bronchus is seen en face. On the left two solitary pulmonary nodules. Based upon the morphology, which lesion has the most malignant features? The lesion on the far left has a spicuated margin and has lucencies within it. The lesion next to it is lobulated in contour and has some spicules radiating to the pleura. It is however homogeneous in attenuation. Based on these findings we should be most concerned that the lesion on the far left is malignant. It proved to be an adenocarninoma, while the other one was a fungal infection. The lucencies and frank air bronchograms should not mislead you in thinking that it probably is infection. Partly solid nodule containing ground-glass component most likely to be malignant
Solid and Ground-glass components:
Another result from screening studies is that nodules containing a ground-glass component are more likely to be malignant (5). LEFT: 1 in 5 malignantRIGHT: 2 in 3 malignant On the far left a lesion that only has a ground-glass appearance and next to it a lesion that has both ground-glass and solid components. The likelihood of malignancy is 1:5 for the lesion on the far left and 2:3 for the lesion with both ground-glass and solid components. Baseline scan and scans after contrast enhancement. Benign lesion with
Contrast enhancement:
Contrast enhancement less than 15 HU has a very high predictive value for benignity (99%). After a baseline scan, 4 consecutive scans at 1 minute interval are performed. This applies only for nodules with the following selection criteria:
PET-CT: benign versus malignant:
False negative PET in a patient with adenocarcinoma. Activity is not sufficient for the diagnosis malignancy. PET-CT plays an increasingly important role in the evaluation of solitary nodules. When you perform PET-CT, you have to realize the following: With these specificity numbers, there will be false positives in about 20%, depending on the background prevalence of granulomatous disease. On the left a patient with an adenocarcinoma, that was not hypermetabolic on the PET, so it is a false negative PET.

Shoulder - Rotator cuff injury:
Robin Smithuis, Frank Smithuis and Henk-Jan van der Woude
Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, Amsterdam University Medical Centre and the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis in Amsterdam, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2022-03-23 The rotator cuff plays an important role in the stabilization of the glenohumeral joint during movements of the arm.
Rotator cuff tearsare the most common cause of shoulder pain and result in loss of strength and loss of stability of the shoulder. In this article we will discuss: Depiction of anatomical variations of osseous outlet in patients with impingement symptoms. Anatomy
Anatomy:
Anterior view of the shoulder
Rotator cuff:
The rotator cuff is composed of the tendons of the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor, that attach to the proximal humerus.
The main function of the rotator cuff is to stabilize and center the humeral head in the glenoid cavity during movements of the arm by compressing the humeral head against the glenoid.
The rotator cuff – as the name suggests – also plays a major role in the internal and external rotation of the arm. SubscapularisThe subscapularis is located anterior to the scapula with insertion of the tendon on the lesser tuberosity.
The subscapularis muscle is a powerful internal rotator which also supports the arm during abduction and adduction. Dislocation of the long head of the biceps will result in rupture of part of the subscapularis tendon. SupraspinatusThe supraspinatus muscle is located in the suprascapular fossa with insertion of the tendon on the greater tuberosity. The supraspinatus muscle initiates the abduction of the arm, which is continued by the deltoid muscle, which is the great abductor and extensor of the arm. Long head of the biceps
The long head of biceps tendon is anatomically and functionally related to the rotator cuff. The tendon arises from the supraglenoid tubercle and its proximal segment is intra-articular. It exits the gleno-humeral joint and passes through the rotator interval between the subscapularis and supraspinatus tendons into the bicipital groove of the proximal humerus Posterior view of the shoulder InfraspinatusThe infraspinatus muscleis located posterior to the scapula, inferior to the scapular spine. The tendon of the Infraspinatus muscle attacheson the posterior aspect of the greater tuberosity.
The infraspinatus muscle is a strong external rotator and additionally assists in both abduction and adduction. Teres minorThe teres minor muscleis located inferior to the infraspinatus muscle.
The tendon attaches on the greater tuberosity.
The teres minor muscle’s function consists primarily of external rotation and adduction of the arm. Other structures that stabilize the glenohumeral joint are the joint capsule, labrum and glenohumeral ligaments.
Acromion types:
Four types of acromial arch are described.
In the Bigliami classification type 1-3 were described. later a fourth convex type was added. Type 2 with the curved shape is the most common type. Type 3 with a hooked shape is the only type that is associated with an increased incidence of shoulder impingement.
Os Acromiale:
Failure of one of the acromial ossification centers to fuse will result in an os acromiale. 
It is present in 5% of the population. 
Usually it is an incidental finding and regarded as a normal variant. An os acromiale may cause symptoms due to arthrosis in the acromio-acromion articulation or due to impingement because if the os acromiale is unstable, it may be pulled inferiorly during abduction by the deltoid, which attaches here. On MR an os acromiale is best seen on superior axial images.
An os acromiale must be mentioned in the report, because in patients who are considered for subacromial decompression, the removal of the acromion distal to the synchondrosis may further destabilize the synchondrosis and allow for even greater mobility of the os acromiale after surgery and worsening of the impingement (4). The axial MR-images show an os acromiale with degenerative changes, i.e. subchondral cysts and osteophytes (arrow).
Etiology of rotator cuff tears:
The etiology of rotator cuff tears can be traumatic, like in a direct trauma to the subscapular muscle and tendon or a more chronic tear of the supraspinatous tendon due to repetitive trauma in overhead sports-activity.
This is usually seen in younger people. In older people the cause of rotator cuff tears is degenerative as seen in subacromial impingement or due to hypovascularity in specific parts of the tendons.
Partial thickness tears:
Partial thickness tears are rotator cuff tears that do not have a full transmural extension from the articular side to the bursal side. Partial thickness tears can be divided into: Articular-sided partial tears are more common than bursal-sided, because the eccentric forces are more intense on articular side and the fibers on the articular side are weaker and healing is reduced. Partial thickness tears are best visualized on coronal PD and T2WI with and without fat suppression.
MR arthrography is very sensitive for detection of even small PTT, but only on the articular surface.
The ABER position allows assessment of both the vertical and interstitial component. Report on the extent of tendon involvement : more or less than 50% of the tendon thickness. Partial thickness tears may progress to full thickness tears. Bursal-sided tear not visible on MR arthrogram. Bursal-sided tears cannot be detected on a MR arthogram, because the intra-aticular contrast cannot fill the defect (figure). On MR partial thickness tears have a signal intensity equal to water on T2WI in the focal defect. The most frequent locations are: Images
On the T2W-image there is a large bursal-sided tear. 
Notice that on the MR-arthrogram the tear is not visible, as the intra-articular contrast cannot reach the defect in the tendon.
Rim-rent tear:
Rim-rent tears are a common type of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. They are commonly overlooked on MRI, possibly because of failure to appreciate the high incidence of these types of tears and failure to inspect the anterior-most fibers of the rotator cuff [ref]. The image is a coronal T1-weighted fat-suppressed MR arthrogram. It shows a partial articular-sided tear of the distal supraspinatus tendon or rim-rent tear, also called PASTA lesion - partial articular supraspinatus tendon avulsion. Here a PASTA lesion in another patient. Images
Illustration and coronal T1 fat-suppressed MR arthrogram.
Full Thickness tears:
Full thickness tears (FTT) extend from the bursal surface all the way to the articular surface. Full thickness tears can be divided into: The table shows the checklist for full thickness tears.
Incomplete full thickness tears:
The hall mark on MRI of an incomplete full thickness tear is a gap filled with fluid on T2WI. However sometimes the gap within the tendon can be filled with debris or granulation tissue  and the signal will not equal water. ImagesThere is an incomplete small full thickness tear of the distal supraspinatus tendon with no retraction.

A line is drawn from the edge of the coracoid to the inferior scapular tip and from the scapular spine to the coracoid process. If the muscle is convex above the line, there is no atrophy. 
If the muscle is just below this line, moderate atrophy is present.
If there is barely any muscle visible, there is severe atrophy. The left image shows a normal muscle anatomy on a sagittal image. The image on the right is of a patient with a full thickness tear of both the supra- and infraspinatus tendon with retraction.
There is fatty atrophy of the supra- and infraspinatus muscle. Irregular full thickness tear. On fat suppressed images it can be difficult to appreciate the muscle atrophy and fat replacement. Images
On the fat suppressed image on the left you might think that the supraspinatus muscle is normal (blue arrow).
However on the image without fat suppression you can appreciate the extreme muscle atrophy and fatty replacement with high signal (blue arrow).
The red arrow indicates the full thickness tear of the supraspinatous tendon. Sometimes it can be difficult to differentiate a partial tear from a full thickness tear. When you look at the first image, it looks like an articular-sided partial thickness tear. However there is irregular extension of contrast on subsequential MR arthrogram slices from the articular side on the left to the bursal side on the right indicating a full thickness tear.
Biceps tendon:
The long head of the biceps tendon inserts at the superior glenoid tubercle. Then it runs through the glenohumeral joint and the rotator interval to exit the joint anteriorly within the intertubercular sulcus. The biceps tendon contributes in prevention of superior migration of the humeral head. Biceps tendon injuries are: Dislocation of long head biceps tendon with a partial thickness tear of the subscapularis tendon and a full thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon
Dislocation of long head biceps tendon:
Disruption of the transverse humeral ligament may lead to medial dislocation of the biceps tendon.
The biceps tendon may shift in or beneath the subscapularis tendon with subscapularis tendon disruption. ImagesMR arthrography with axial T1-weighted fat-suppressed and coronal PD images.

There is a partial thickness tear of the subscapularis tendon.
On the PDW-image there is a fluid filled gap at the distal insertion of the supraspinatus tendon and contrast extending into the subacromial-subdeltoid space indicating a full thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon.

There is an incomplete rupture of the subscapularis tendon combined with edema due to fracture of the lesser tubercle.
Shoulder impingement:
When you raise your arm to shoulder height, the space between the acromion and rotator cuff narrows. 
The acromion can rub against or "impinge" on the tendon and the bursa, causing irritation and pain.
Impingement and  damage to the rotator cuff tendons are the most common shoulder problems that occur in the narrow subacromial space and these two problems can exist separately or together. In any shoulder examination we should look for signs of impingement like a narrowed subacromial space, abnormal shape of the aromion or osteoarthrosis.
Types of impingement:
Images
Primary extrinsic impingement due to dowsloping of the acromion with tendinosis of the supraspinatus tendon Thickening or calcification of the coracoacromial ligament can also cause impingement. In this patient the coracoacromial ligament is thickened and compresses the supraspinatus tendon.
Tendinosis:
Rotator cuff tendinosis is degeneration of the tendon. It is also called tendinitis or tendinopathy. Common MRI-findings are: Images
Tendinosis with thickening of the supraspinatus tendon.
ONly on PDW-images you will see increased signal.
Calcifying tendinosis:
This is a painful shoulder condition characterized by  calcium deposits in the rotator cuff. In most cases there is spontaneous resolution, but in some cases the pain and dysfunction persist.
This is more often seen in women age 30-50y. Ultrasound 
US will show the presence, location and size of the calcium deposits and can help in guidance for therapeutic needling and lavage.
In the resting phase the deposits appear hyperechoic and arc shaped.
In the resolving phase the deposits are non-arc shaped, fragmented, cystic and nodular.
In the reabsorption phase increased Doppler vascularity can be seen. MRIUsually the MRI shows low signal intensity on all sequences, but sometimes there is high signal on T2W-images representing edema in the resorptive phase.
Rotator cuff arthropathy:
Rotator cuff arthropathy is a pattern of joint degeneration due to loss of stabilizing function by the rotator cuff.
The rotator cuff provides a net inferiorly directed force, balaced by a superiorly directed force by the deltoid muscle. In rotator cuff arthropathy the following findings can be seen: Signs of irrepairability and indication for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty are: Hamada classification for rotator cuff arthropathy: case 1 The images show a narrowed subacromial space (arrowhead) secondary to a rotator cuff tear with retraction of both the supraspinatus tendon (yellow arrow) and of the infraspinatus tendon (blue arrow). case 2 This patient has a narrowed subacromial space. Notice that the narrowing is well seen on the image with the shoulder in exorotation position, while it is not seen on the endorotation view. case 3 These images show an acromioclavicular cyst, also referred to as Geyser sign, which is secondary to rotator cuff pathology. The fluid extends superiorly into and outside a degenerated AC joint with disruption of inferior AC joint capsule.
Parsonage Turner syndrome:
Parsonage–Turner syndrome is a neuritis involving the brachial plexus.
It is also referred to as idiopathic brachial plexopathy or neuralgic amyotrophy. It is characterized by sudden, excruciating pain in the shoulder, followed by severe weakness. Parsonage–Turner syndrome is a rare disorder that generally involves one upper limb, mostly the axillary nerve, the upper trunk of the brachial plexus, the suprascapular nerve, and the long thoracic nerve are affected. It may present with symptoms of an isolated peripheral nerve lesion, although the pathology is thought to lie more proximally. ImagesOblique sagittal PD image and coronal T2 fat-suppressed image.

Publicationdate 2012-05-21 A Bankart lesion is an injury of the anterior glenoid labrum due to anterior shoulder dislocation. These labral tears make the shoulder unstable and susceptible to repeated dislocations. In this article we will focus on: Bankart tears and variants Introduction
Introduction:
Clockwise approach. Click on image to enlarge
Clockwise approach to labral pathology:
A Clockwise approach to the labrum is the easiest way to diagnose labral tears and to differentiate them from normal labral variants. There are two types of labral tears: SLAP tears and Bankart lesions. SLAP is an acronym that stands for 'Superior Labral tear from Anterior to Posterior'. SLAP tears start at the 12 o'clock position where the biceps anchor is located, which tears the labrum off the glenoid. SLAP tears typically extend from the 10 to the 2 o'clock position, but can extend more posteriorly or anteriorly and even extend into the biceps tendon. Bankart lesions are typically located in the 3-6 o'clock position because that's where the humeral head dislocates. There are many labral variants that may simulate a labral tear. They also have a typical location. They are not in the 3-6 o'clock position, which makes it easy to differentiate them from a Bankart tear. A Bankart tear can extend to the 1-3 o'clock position, but then there should also be a tear in the 3-6 o'clock position. Labral variants however may mimick a SLAP tear. Labral variants
Dislocation:
The shoulder is a very mobile and therefore unstable joint. It is the most dislocated joint in the body. The humeral head is almost always displaced anteriorly and medially below the coracoid process.
Anterior dislocation:
The shoulder almost always dislocates to anterior and inferior, because motion to superior is limited by the acromion, coracoid process and rotator cuff (figure). Motion in a posterior direction is limited by the posterior rim of the glenoid which is in an anteverted position. An uncommon cause of anterior dislocation is inpatients with a dysplasia of the glenoid. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll The dislocation of the humeral head to antero-inferior causes damage to the antero-inferior rim of the glenoid in the 3 - 6 o'clock position (marked in red). Especially in younger patients this results in a Bankart fracture or a Bankart lesion which is a tear of the anteroinferior labrum. This results in instability and recurrent dislocations. Due to these recurrent dislocations significant bone loss and erosion of the anterior glenoid rim may occur, which maintains the unstable situation. Scroll through images. Enable Scroll

Bankart fracture:
This is a post-reduction view. Notice the very large fracture of the glenoid rim with displacement. Scroll through images. On the coronal-oblique and sagittal reconstruction the displaced fragment of the glenoid rim is seen in the 3-6 o'clock position. On the coronal image a large Hill-Sachs defect is seen. This is a bone defect as result of the impaction of the glenoid rim on the humeral head. 3D-reconstruction of a large bony Bankart in the 2 - 6 o'clock position. LEFT: Hill-Sachs at level of coracoid. RIGHT: Normal groove seen at level below coracoid.
Hill-Sachs:
On MR a Hill-Sachs defect is seen at or above the level of the coracoid process. Hill-Sachs is a posterolateral depression of the humeral head. It is above or at the level of the coracoid in the first 18 mm of the proximal humeral head. It is seen in 75-100% of patients with anterior instability. The physiologic groove in the humerus or cysts and erosions at the attachment site of the infraspinatus tendon can simulate a Hill-Sachs, but usually this is not a diagnostic problem (figure).

Posterior dislocation:
Posterior dislocations are uncommon and easily missed, because there is less displacement compared to the anterior dislocation. On the AP-view the head looks strange due to the internal rotation. On the transscapular-Y view the humeral head is displaced posteriorly. Sometimes the displacement is difficult to appreciate, especially when the transscapular-Y view is slightly rotated. Sometimes an axillary view can be of help, but when in doubt go to CT. Scroll through images. Posterior dislocation Images of another patient with a posterior dislocation. On the transscapular-Y view the humeral head is displaced posteriorly. Notice the distance between the humeral head and the glenoid on the AP-view, which is abnormally wide. Posterior dislocations are uncommon and not as obvious on the X-rays as an anterior dislocation. Approximately half of the posterior shoulder dislocations go undiagnosed on initial presentation, because of a low level of clinical suspicion and insufficient imaging. Posterior dislocation-fracture Posterior dislocations account for 2-4% of all shoulder dislocations. Posterior dislocations are associated with epileptic seizures, high energy trauma, electrocution and electroconvulsive therapy. On the images a posterior dislocation is seen with a fracture.

Disable Scroll The MR-images are of a patient who had undergone both an anterior aswell as a posterior dislocation. This resulted in both a Hill-Sachs impression fracture on the posterior aspect of the humeral head (blue arrow) and an impression fracture on the anterior aspect as a result of posterior dislocation (red arrow). Scroll through images. Superior dislocation This was an incidental finding on a chest-film. There is a superior dislocation of the humeral head. This is probably the result of a very large long-standing rotator cuff tear with progressive cranialisation of the humeral head and erosion of the acromion.
Bankart and variants:
Axial images of Bankart lesions and variants Bankart-lesions and variants like Perthes and ALPSA are injuries to the anteroinferior labrum. These injuries are always located in the 3-6 o'clock position because they are caused by an anterior-inferior dislocation. The only exception to this rule is the reverse Bankart, which is the result of a posterior dislocation and injury to the inferoposterior labrum. Bankart tears may extend to superior, but this is uncommon. Detachment of the anteroinferior labrum (3-6 o'clock) with complete tearing of the anterior scapular periosteum with or without an osseus fragment of the glenoid.
* Reverse Bankart Detachment of the posteroinferior labrum (6-9 o'clock) with tearing of the posterior scapular periosteum with or without an osseus fragment of the glenoid.

Bankart lesion:
Bankart lesions are labral tears without an osseus fragment. MR arthrography or arthroscopy are optimal to diagnose Bankart or Bankart-like lesions. There is a detachment of the anteroinferior labrum (3-6 o'clock) with complete tearing of the anterior scapular periosteum. The arrow points to the disrupted periosteum. On MR-athrography the labrum is missing on the anterior glenoid and the labral fragment is displaced anteriorly (arrow). Osseus Bankart

Perthes lesion:
A Perthes lesion is a labroligamentous avulsion like a Bankart, but with a medially stripped intact periosteum. On images of the shoulder with the arm in a neutral position, the torn labrum may be held in its normal anatomic position by the intact scapular periosteum, which thereby prevents contrast media from entering the tear. This means that MR-arthrography with the arm in the neutral position may fail to detect the labral tear. In the ABER position however there is tension on the antero-inferior labrum by the stretched anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament and you have more chance to detect the tear. The arrow points to the intact periosteum. LEFT: normal ABER-view. RIGHT: Image rotated 90? anti-clockwise. The images in ABER-position demonstrate a detached anterior labrum.

Solid Renal Masses:
Rinze Reinhard, Mandy van der Zon-Conijn and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis in Amsterdam, Medical Center Haaglanden-Bronovo in the Hague, Leiden University Medical Center in Leiden and the Alrijne hospital in Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2016-06-14 Most renal masses are incidental findings. Many of these masses are renal cell carcinomas. The goal of imaging is to differentiate these renal cell carcinomas from benign disease, although in many cases it may not be possible. There are certain imaging findings, however, which are in favor of benign disease or low grade malignancy. These imaging findings may offer guidance to patients and referring physicians in making management decisions. Options include partial or radical nephrectomy, biopsy and tumor ablation or follow up with watchful waiting. In this article we will discuss imaging features of benign and malignant renal tumors and tumor mimics.
Differentiation of renal masses:
The steps in the differentiation of a renal lesion are: Once you have followed these steps, there will be many cases in which a final diagnosis can not be made and renal cell carcinoma is still on top of your list of differential diagnoses. Use CT and MR to look for findings that are in favor of a benign or low-grade tumor versus a high-grade renal cell carcinoma.
CT:
Hyperdensity on unenhanced CTA lesion with a density > 70 HU on an unenhanced CT scan is a hemorrhagic cyst. Hemorrhagic cysts may have densities lower than 70 HU, but in these cases we also need to check the post-contrast series for any enhancement. Lack of enhancement confirms the cystic nature of these lesions. Macroscopic fat < -20 HU in a renal mass is a reliable sign of an angiomyolipoma. Thin slices can be helpful to determine the density. Unfortunately 5% of AMLs do not contain macroscopic fat. These lipid-poor AMLs can not be distinguished from renal cell carcinoma. In rare cases, RCCs can also contain fat. The presence of calcifications and fat should raise the suspicion of a RCC. Equivocal enhancement of 10-20 HU can be due to pseudo-enhancement in a cyst as a result of beam hardening. MRI can be helpful in differentiating these cases, since it better depicts enhancement. Equivocal enhancement can also be seen in low-enhancing lesions like papillary renal cell carcinoma, which usually is a less aggressive subtype than the more common clear cell carcinoma. Homogeneous enhancement and a high attenuation value on unenhanced CT (> 40 HU) is in favor of the diagnosis of a lipid-poor AML, although RCC can not be reliably excluded. Strong enhancement is seen in clear cell carcinoma, lipid-poor AML and oncocytoma. Since clear cell carcinoma is far more common than an oncocytoma or a lipid-poor AML, clear cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis, especially in a large and heterogeneous mass. Mention the possibility of a lipid-poor AML or oncocytoma in your report, as surveillance or biopsy may be an option in poor surgical candidates.
MRI:
High signal on T1-weighted images is typically seen in hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cysts and in angiomyolipomas that contain macroscopic extracellular fat. Intracellular fat however does not result in a high signal on T1-weighted images but it results in a signal drop on out of phase images.
This can be seen in minimal fat AML or RCC. 82% of clear cell RCC have intracellular fat, which has a 90% specificity for the diagnosis of a clear cell renal cell carcinoma. MRI is better than CT in the accurate diagnosis of a cystic lesion and it can better depict enhancement and differentiate CT-pseudo-enhancement from real enhancement. Low T2-signal is in favor of papillary RCC or minimal fat angiomyolipoma. High T2 is typically seen in clear cell RCC but is not specific, since it can also be seen in oncocytomas. So again there is much overlap between benign and malignant tumors.
Ball or Bean:
Another way to look at renal solid masses is to look at the shape. Solid lesions can be divided into ball-type and bean-type lesions. Ball-type lesions are the most common and present as expansile masses, deforming the renal contour. Renal cell carcinomas and oncocytomas are typical ball-type lesions. Bean-type lesions do not deform the renal contour and the bean-shape of the kidney is preserved. Bean-type lesions are more difficult to detect and usually not visible on unenhanced CT images. Notice that there is much overlap in the differential diagnosis of ball-type and bean-type lesions.
Bean-type lesions:
The radiologic features of bean-type lesions are generally nonspecific. Notice the similar appearance of the lesions in the figure. The differential diagnosis can often be suggested by integrating clinical and imaging data.
Size of a tumor:
The size of a tumor is regarded as the most important predictor of malignancy and aggressive histologic grade (1). The risk of metastatic disease depends on the size of the tumor. If the size of a tumor is less than 3 cm the risk of metastatic disease is negligible. Most incidentally found renal masses are small, defined as < 4 cm. Many of these masses will be either low grade RCC, indolent malignancies or benign lesions. In renal masses of 1-2 cm which were surgically removed, 56% had a benign histology. Only 13% of masses 6-7 cm had a benign histology. The growth rate of a small renal mass on serial imaging however has not been shown to provide reliable prediction of malignancy or benignity.
Renal cell carcinoma:
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a typical ball-type lesion. 50% of RCCs are incidental findings on imaging studies performed for non-urinary tract symptoms. Peak incidence of RCC is between 60 and 70 years. RCC is associated with hereditary syndromes, such as von Hippel-Lindau, tuberous sclerosis and Birt-Hogg-Dubé. The most common subtype of RCC is clear cell carcinoma, followed by papillary and chromophobe RCC. Multilocular cystic RCC is uncommon and discussed here. Renal medullary carcinoma is also very uncommon and occurs almost exclusively in patients with sickle cell trait.
Clearcell RCC:
This is the most common subtype of RCC, accounting for 70% of all RCCs. These tumors arise from the renal cortex and are often expansive. It is a hypervascular lesion, frequently heterogeneous due to necrosis, hemorrhage, cystic components or calcifications. In rare cases, RCCs can also contain extracellular fat. In a mass with both calcifications and fat, consider the possibility of a RCC. Clear cell carcinoma best seen in nefrogenic phase A typical feature of clear cell carcinoma is strong enhancement in the corticomedullary phase. This can be difficult to assess when the lesion is small and located in the renal cortex, which also enhances strongly. The nephrogenic phase is therefore the most sensitive phase for the detection of these lesions, as the renal parenchyma enhances homogeneously and more intensely than the tumor (figure). On MR clear cell RCC is usually iso- to hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Typically renal cell carcinomas do not have extracellular fat, which differentiates them from angiomyolipomas. However 80% of clear cell RCC have intracellular fat, which leads to a drop in signal intensity on T1 opposed-phase images compared to in-phase images. Do not confuse this finding for extracellular fat and do not make the mistake to conclude that you are dealing with an angiomyolipoma. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is associated with development of clear cell RCCs, often bilateral or multifocal. Patients with a clear cell RCC have a 5-year survival of 50-60%, which is worse than papillary or chromophobe RCC. Infiltrative lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney, hardly visible on the unenhanced image on the left, clearly visible in the nephrogenic phase shown on the right. PA showed clearcell RCC Of all the clear cell RCCs, around 5% have an infiltrative growth pattern. While this is only a small portion of the RCCs, the overall prevalence of RCC makes it an important consideration for the differential diagnosis of an infiltrative bean-type lesion. Infiltrative RCCs are aggressive and hypervascular. It alters the internal architecture of the kidney, preserving the renal contour. Collecting system abnormalities can be similar to those seen in transitional cell carcinomas.
Papillary RCC:
Papillary RCC accounts for 10-15% of all RCCs. These lesions are typically homogeneous and hypovascular and can therefore mimic cysts. In contrast to clear cell carcinoma, the enhancement of papillary renal cell carcinoma can be very subtle, up to only 10-20 HU difference between unenhanced and enhanced images. Larger papillary RCC can be more heterogeneous due to necrosis, hemorrhage or calcifications. On MR they are frequently iso- to hypointense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted imaged. In very rare cases macroscopic fat is encountered in the lesion, often with calcifications. Bilateral and multifocal tumors are more frequently seen in papillary RCC than in other types of RCC. The 5-year survival is 80-90%. Chromophobe RCC
Chromophobe RCC:
5% of the RCCs are of the chromophobe type. It is a solid, sharply demarcated and sometimes slightly lobulated lesion. They can have a central scar or spoke-wheel pattern of contrast enhancement, similar to oncocytomas. It is not possible to differentiate chromophobe RCC from an oncocytoma on imaging. Even the histology of these tumors share similar characteristics. The enhancement of a chromophobe RCC is often homogeneous and less intense than in clear cell RCC. The prognosis of a chromophobe RCC is similar to the prognosis of papillary RCC with a 5-year survival of 80-90%. Chromophobe RCC and luncysts in a patient with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome Chromophobe RCC can be seen in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare disorder. These patients have small papular skin lesions called fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts with spontaneous pneumothorax and a high incidence of different kinds of renal cell carcinoma: most frequently chromphobe RCC, less commonly oncocytoma, and rarely clear cell carcinoma.
Staging RCC:
RCC can invade the perinephric fat beyond the renal fascia and can extend into the renal vein, inferior vena cava or the adjacent adrenal gland. For the surgeon it is important to know whether there is tumor thrombus in the IVC and if it extends into the chest above the diaphragm (need for a thoracic surgeon during the operation). Approximately 25% of the patients have metastases at presentation. Enable Scroll

Common sites are the lung, liver, lymph nodes and bones. Less common sites are pancreas, adrenal gland, contralateral kidney, mesentery, abdominal wall and brain. The image shows a patient with metastases in the pancreas.
Angiomyolipoma:
Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign solid renal mass. It is composed of angiomatous tissue, smooth muscle and fat. If a lesion contains macroscopic fat on CT, the diagnosis of AML can be made. On CT an AML is usually a well-defined, heterogeneous tumor, located in the renal cortex and containing areas of fat density of -20 HU or less. Calcification or necrosis within the tumor is rare. The presence of both fat and calcifications should raise the suspicion of a RCC. Enhancement is seen in the vascular and smooth muscle portions of the lesion. Multiple Angiomyolipomas in a patient with tuberous sclerosis. Multiple Angiomyolipomas Sporadic AML is typically small, unilateral and asymptomatic, usually seen as an incidental finding. In 10-20% of cases angiomyolipomas are multiple and bilateral. This is mainly seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Bleeding in Angiomyopiloma Due to the abnormal vessels within an AML, it is prone to bleeding. Patients can present with acute flank pain due to spontaneous hemorrhage. The risk of hemorrhage increases with size. Embolization was performed to stop the bleeding. Preventive embolization is recommended in tumors larger than 4 cm, even in asymptomatic patients. Notice the large vessels in the AML in the left kidney.
Minimal fat Angiomyolipoma:
In 5% of AMLs there is no detectable fat on CT. The fat can be obscured by internal hemorrhage or it can be a so called minimal fat AML. On MR macroscopic fat in an AML gives low signal on fat-suppressed images. Microscopic or intracellular fat, seen as a drop in signal intensity on T1 opposed-phase images compared to in-phase images, is not specific for AML, but can also be present in renal cell carcinoma. Since the fat is likely to be intracellular in RCC, it is unlikely to be visible on CT images.
Oncocytoma:
Oncocytoma in left kidney with central scar Oncocytoma is the second most common benign solid renal mass. 3-7% of all solid renal tumors are oncocytomas. They appear as sharply demarcated lesions with uniform enhancement at CT and often have a central scar. The central scar can not be distinguished from a central scar or central necrosis in a RCC, therefore oncocytoma is the most commonly excised benign solid mass. Oncocytoma in right kidney with central scar Calcifications in an oncocytoma are rare. The tumor is usually solitary, 2-12 cm in diameter, but can be multifocal and bilateral. In less than 10% of cases oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC occur simultaneously.
Transitional cell carcinoma:
TCC in left kidney preserving the bean shape of the kidney Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) also known as urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) arises from the epithelial cells lining the urinary tract. Most frequently the TCC arises in the renal pelvis, as a low-grade, superficial tumor, producing a focal intraluminal mass in the renal collecting system. Approximately 15% of the TCCs are of a more aggressive type with infiltrative growth, altering the regional architecture of the adjacent renal sinus and renal parenchyma, without changing the renal contour. TCC is a typical bean-type lesion (see figure). Upper-tract TCC has a peak incidence in the 60- to 70-year age group and is twice as common in men as in women. Risk factors are smoking, chemical carcinogens, cyclophosphamide therapy and analgesic abuse, particularly long-term use of phenacetin. TCC in right kidney preserving the bean shape of the kidney TCC is hard to detect on unenhanced CT images. The nephrogenic phase is the optimal phase to show the interface between TCC and normal enhancing renal parenchyma. Excretory phase images show collecting system abnormalities such as dilated calyces, calyces distended by tumor or unopacified calyces due to tumor infiltration. TCC can be locally aggressive with invasion of the retroperitoneum. Regional lymphadenopathy and distant metastases to the lungs and bones may be encountered. TCC is commonly multifocal with a high incidence of recurrence, therefore requiring thorough surveillance. TCC has a greater risk of seeding after percutaneous biopsy than RCC, therefore it is not recommended to perform biopsy when there is suspicion of TCC.
Lymphoma:
B-cell lymphoma with renal and bone involvement (arrows) The kidney is a common extranodal site of lymphoma involvement, especially in Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Primary involvement of the kidney is rare. Renal lymphoma usually presents as multiple poorly enhancing masses, but may also present as retroperitoneal tumors directly invading the kidneys or as perirenal soft-tissue masses. Diffuse infiltration of the renal interstitium results in nephromegaly and is more common in Burkitt lymphoma. The image shows bilateral involvement of the kidney and a bone lesion in a patient with B-cell lymphoma. Here another patient with lymphoma located in the mediastinum, pancreas (arrow) and in both kidneys. Diffuse enlargement of both kidneys in a patient with lymphoma. Continue with the PET-CT. PET-CT shows diffuse renal involvement and also positive periaortic lymph nodes (arrows).
Metastases:
Infiltrative lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney, which has considerably grown six months later, with extensive lymphadenopathy. This turned out to be a metastasis of a lungcarcinoma. Primary malignancies that most commonly metastasize to the kidney are lung, breast, gastrointestinal tumors and melanoma. Renal metastases usually occur late in the course of a known malignancy as part of widespread disease. In rare cases a renal metastasis may manifest as a solitary lesion and may be hard to differentiate from a renal cell carcinoma. A percutaneous biopsy can be performed to solve this problem. Multiple liver and renal metastases. Thrombus in the left renal vein (arrow). Renal metastases are typically small, multifocal and bilateral, with an infiltrative growth pattern. They show mild enhancement, much less than that of the normal renal parenchyma. Metastases can also be hypervascular however, as in melanoma, and sometimes breast cancer. The image shows a patient with multiple renal metastases. Notice the tumor thrombus in the left renal vein. Here a patient with lung cancer. There is a metastasis in the left kidney and there are multiple lymph node metastases (arrows). If this was the only presentation, it would be difficult to differentiate from a renal cell carcinoma with lymph node metastases.
Infection:
Pyelonephritis and renal abscess can be tumor mimics, but in most cases the history and the clinical findings help you to make the right diagnosis. In this case there are hypodense areas in both kidneys. Based on the imaging alone the main differential is multifocal pyelonephritis, lymphoma and metastases. This patient had a urinary tract infection and episodes of flank pain and there was no history of a primary tumor or lymphoma. So the diagnosis is pyelonephritis. A CT scan 4 months later shows normal enhancement of both kidneys; the renal abnormalities on the first scan were therefore consistent with an episode of multifocal pyelonephritis. Renal abscess is usually a complication of acute pyelonephritis and patients present with urinary tract infection, flank pain and fever. On CT a renal abscess usually presents as a non-specific homogeneous low attenuation lesion or as a complex cystic lesion. Cystic lesion with thick enhancing rim and infiltration of perirenal fat in a patient with a renal abscess The renal abscess may have a thick irregular enhancing wall with infiltration of the perirenal fat (figure). In patients with an atypical clinical presentation the complex cystic appearance and extension into the perirenal fat may simulate a renal cell carcinoma. This patient had a typical presentation with right flank pain and laboratory findings consistent with a urinary tract infection. The ultrasound image shows a hypoechogenic lesion with some echolucency, which indicates a fluid-containing component. This proved to be an abscess. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis an uncommon condition caused by a chronic granulomatous infection with accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages. Frequently there is an obstructing stone with dilatation of calyces. It results in diffuse renal destruction, but can be segmental as well. Renal enlargement is present in all patients and in some cases macroscopic fat can be seen. Here another example of a xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. There is destruction of the right kidney, multiple calculi and surrounding fibrofatty proliferation. This appearance may resemble a liposarcoma.
Infarction:
Renal infarction Renal infarction usually results from thromboembolismin cardiovascular disease. The common clinical presentation is acute flank pain and hematuria. In the acute phase CT will show a wedge-shaped area of decreased attenuation followed in a later stage by atrophy. When the whole kidney is infarcted, the kidney will be enlarged and of low attenuation. Only the outer cortex may still enhance through collaterals resulting in a cortical rim sign. Here another case of renal infarction. Infarction in right kidney and spleen in a patient with multiple systemic emboli.
Pitfalls:
Pseudo-enhancement in a renal cyst.
Pseudo-enhancement:
Pseudo-enhancement is a pitfall to be aware of in the evaluation of renal masses. As mentioned before a small difference in Hounsfield units (< 20 HU) can be measured in a renal cyst on contrast-enhanced CT images due to beam-hardening. This case shows pseudo-enhancement in a lesion which proved to be a cyst at MRI. Dromedary hump
Dromedary hump:
Prominent columns of Bertin, bulging of the renal contour and focal renal hypertrophy can look like a renal mass on ultrasound, unenhanced images and CT in the nephrogenic phase. In the corticomedullary phase the normal corticomedullary pattern in these pseudotumors can be appreciated, distinguishing them from real lesions. Suspected renal mass of the left kidney on ultrasound. CT shows a bulging of the left renal contour, commonly referred to as a dromedary hump. Pseudotumor. Nefrogenic phase on the left and corticomedullary phase on the right. Here is another case. In the nephrogenic phase one could argue there is a lesion in the left kidney. In the corticomedullary phase however it is clear that this is a pseudotumor.

2. Simplified Imaging Approach for Evaluation of the Solid Renal Mass in Adults by Ray Dyer, MD, David J. DiSantis, MD Bruce L. McClennan, MD. Radiology: Volume 247: Number 2-May 2008
Esophagus I: anatomy, rings, inflammation:
Terrence C. Demos, MD, Harold V. Posniak, MD, Wayde Nagamine, MD and Mary Olson, MD
Department of Radiology of the Loyola University Medical Center, USA:
Publicationdate 2007-11-26 In Esophagus part I we will discuss: Vascular impressions. Anatomy and Function
Anatomy and Function:
LEFT: Lateral view: Epiglottis (red arrow). Post cricoid impression (yellow arrows). Cricopharyngeous impression (white arrow).RIGHT: AP-view: Small lateral pharyngeal pouches (arrows)
Hypopharynx:
Common structures that we can visualize are: If a normal pouch becomes enlarged, it is termed a lateral pharyngeal diverticulum.
* Cricopharyngeal muscle impression:
Extrinsic impression on posterior esophagus by contracted muscle. Esophagus mucosa: normal thin, parallel, uniform mucosal folds The esophageal wall is composed of: Normal gastroesophageal junction (left), Fundal adenocarcinoma invades esophagus (right) At the gastroesophageal junction smooth, uniform folds in gastric fundus converge on very distal esophagus (arrow). Image next to it shows abnormal gastroesophageal junction: Barium outlines thick, irregular mucosal folds (asterisks). Fundal adenocarcinoma invades esophagus (arrows) Cricopharyngeal achalasia in 46-year-old woman. Feeling of lump in throat. Persistent indentation (arrow) by cricopharyngeus muscle that does not relax as bolus progresses caudally
Upper esophageal sphincter:

Lower esophageal sphincter:
This distention is best demonstrated by breath holding in inspiration or a Valsalva maneuver. Do not mistake this for a hiatal hernia. Spontaneous reflux extends to level of aortic arch.
Gastroesophageal reflux:
Spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux has been demonstrated in up to 1/3 of patients with reflux esophagitis. Various maneuvers during the examination have been used to increase sensitivity, but these are generally discredited as not being physiologic. In addition many asymptomatic patients have spontaneous reflux so that reflux during an esophagram is not sensitive or specific for relating symptoms to reflux.
Esophageal peristalsis:
Normal: Abnormal: On the left tertiary contractions on first swallow (left). Normal primary contraction on next swallow (right). These tertiary contractions are non-propulsive, transient, and intermittent contractions that are inconstant in location and not accompanied by symptoms, usually in older patients. A. Initial nonpropulsive tertiary contractions B. Three images during examination show collections resembling diverticula C. Image later in examination shows resolution of tertiary contractions Sometimes transient tertiary contractions may simulate diverticula. On the left images of a patient with tertiary contractions, that during the examination look like diverticula. Diffuse esophageal spasm. Patient experienced chest pain during examination
Diffuse esophageal spasm:
Diffuse esophageal spasm produces intermittent contractions of the mid and distal esophageal smooth muscle, associated with chest symptoms. Manometry shows simultaneous nonpropulsive contractions on at least 10% of swallows. Diagnosis is based on imaging, manometry, and symptoms.
Nutcracker esophagus:
Nutcracker esophagus is a non-cardiac cause of chest pain attributed to high amplitude distal esophageal peristalsis. This is a controversial diagnosis that is made by manometry and does not have imaging manifestations LEFT: Dilated esophagus (arrows) appears as long, well-defined structure paralleling heart RIGHT: Dilated esophagus usually deviates to right. Narrowing (arrow) at hiatus.
Achalasia:
LEFT: CT shows dilated esophagus (arrow) that led to esophagram.RIGHT: Esophagram shows narrowing (arrow) at level of hiatus. On the left another patient with achalasia. LEFT: Dilated esophagus (arrows) is projected behind right atrium.MIDDLE and RIGHT: Smooth, tapered narrowing just above diaphragm (arrows). On the left another patient with achalasia. During fluoroscopy some peristalsis was seen with typical smooth, tapered narrowing just above diaphragm (arrows).
Lower esophageal rings:
Esophageal ring due to muscular contraction. It varies during examination and may not persist. No definite anatomic correlate B-Ring 20 mm wide, no obstruction Esophageal A-ring due to muscular contraction. It varies during examination and may not persist. On the left another patient with a non-persistent ring at the apex of a sliding hiatus hernia. Esophageal B-ring The esophageal B-ring is located at the squamocolumnar junction, also termed the 'Z' line. The appearance does not change during the examination. On the left a patient with a 'B' ring (arrows) several cm above diaphragm at the apex of sliding hiatus hernia. Note unchanged appearance on these two images. On the left a 52-year-old man with episodic dysphagia. The image on the far left does not show a abnormality, but distal esophagus not distended . With dilation of the distal esophagus, a 13 mm wide Schatzki B-ring (arrows) that caused intermittent obstruction is demonstrated at the apex of a hiatus hernia (arrowhead). On the left a 71-year-old man with chest pain after fast food lunch. Distal obstructing filling defect (arrow) is a piece of meat that passed into stomach during study. Follow-up esophagram shows Schatzki B-ring (arrows) that caused obstruction.
Webs and Diverticula:

Esophageal web:
On the left images of an asymptomatic 52-year-old man. AP and Lateral views show short, thin web (arrows) with minimal intraluminal extension. On the left images of a 42-year-old woman with dysphagia due to web. There is > 50% luminal narrowing Zenker's diverticulum in early and late phase of swallowing
Diverticula:
Pulsion diverticula are due to increased intraluminal pressure.
There are many pulsion diverticula: On the left a patient with a Zenker's diverticulum as a result of premature closure of the cricopharyngeal muscle. Traction diverticula are secondary to adjacent disease. Most located in mid-esophagus. Zenker's diverticulum on chest film, barium study and CT
Zenker's diverticulum:
A Zenker's diverticulum is a pulsion hypopharyngeal false diverticulum with only
mucosa and submucosa protruding through triangular posterior wall weak
site (Killian's dehiscence) between horizontal and oblique components
of cricopharyngeus muscle. The etiology is controversial and is probably due to elevated upper esophageal
pressure, cricopharyngeus dysfunction and reflux. The clinical presentation can be dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration
or a mass or air-fluid level on neck or chest radiographs. The esophagram shows collection with midline posterior origin just above
cricopharyngeus protruding lateral, usually to left, and caudal with
enlargement. Killian-Jamieson diverticulum: AP and lateral view Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is a pulsion diverticulum, that protrudes through a lateral anatomic weak site of the cervical esophagus below the cricopharyngeus muscle, unlike the posterior, midline origin of a Zenker's diverticulum. AP view shows diverticulum (arrow) originating laterally. Lateral view confirms diverticulum does not originate posteriorly as a Zenkers diverticulum would. LEFT: Small diverticulum (arrow) in asymptomatic patient RIGHT: Large diverticulum (arrow) in patient with aspiration Epiphrenic diverticulum These pulsion diverticula are classified by their location near the diaphragm. /ul>
If large they can narrow the esophagus or lead to aspiration. Large epiphrenic diverticulum On the left another example of an epiphrenic diverticulum. The CT demonstrates a large diverticulum (arrow) extends to the right just above diaphragm. This patient was asymptomatic Aortopulmonary window diverticulum The normal esophagus transiently protrudes into the aortopulmonary window. 
Fixed protrusion is an inconsequential diverticulum. On the left small aortopulmonary diverticula (arrows), that are incidental findings in two patients. On the far left a traction diverticulum (arrow) due to hilar granulomatous disease. 
Calcified adenopathy (asterisk). In the middle a pulsion diverticulum (arrow) due to high intraluminal pressure. On the right multiple pulsion diverticula (arrows) that preceded Heller myotomy for achalasia. On the left a traction diverticulum (arrows) secondary to post primary TB. It simulates a cavitary lung lesion on the chest radiograph. Pseudodiverticula can be seen in reflux esophagitis.
On the left a patient with a hiatus hernia, reflux esophagitis, and pseudodiverticula (arrows) at site of proximal stricture Left: Iatrogenic perforation (arrow). MIDDLE: Communicating esophageal duplication (arrows). RIGHT: Extravasation from iatrogenic perforation of hypopharynx in neonate Other pathologic conditions can simulate diverticula.
On the left two patients with a iatrogenic perforation and a patient with a communicating duplication cyst.
Hiatus hernia:
The types of hiatus hernia are listed in the table on the left. The relationship between hiatus hernia, reflux and reflux esophagitis is controversial and poorly understood. Most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have hernias. Many patients with hiatus hernias do not have reflux. Many patients with reflux do not have hiatus hernias. Presence of reflux correlates poorly with GERD.
A sliding hiatus hernia is of doubtful significance when an isolated finding in the absence of clinical or imaging findings of esophagitis. Diagnosis of GERD is based on imaging or endoscopic findings of esophagitis, not presence of a hiatus hernia. Sliding hernia On the left initially, GE junction is below the esophageal hiatus. Later, stomach protrudes through hiatus. Neither the hernia or stricture (arrow) due to reflux esophagitis were visible early in the examination. Paraesophageal hernia Large hernias can cause symptoms, and with progressive hiatal widening, increasing protrusion and rotation of the stomach can lead to gastric volvulus that can be complicated by hemorrhage, obstruction, strangulation, perforation. On the left two examples. On the far left gas filled gastric fundus (asterisk) protrudes through hiatus but GE junction (arrow) is below diaphragm. Next to it a paraesophageal hernia with most of 'upside down' stomach in chest with greater curvature (arrows) flipped up. On the left a mixed hernia. Distal esophagus is adjacent to the herniated gastric fundus, but unlike a paraesophageal hernia, the gastroesophageal junction (arrow) is above rather than below the diaphragm.
Inflammation and Infection:
Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is the most common cause of esophagitis. Other causes of esophagitis are listed in the table on the left.
Reflux esophagitis:
The findings on barium studies are listed in the table on the left. Air-contrast esophagram shows thick esophageal mucosal folds (arrows) and an ulcer (arrowhead) due to GERD. Single contrast esophagram shows stricture (arrow) and sliding hiatus hernia On the left Irregular stricture (arrowhead) and erosions (arrows) due to GERD. Barrett's esophagus with reticular mucosa and web-like (arrow) stricture
Barrett's esophagus:
Barrett's esophagus (columnar metaplasia) is the result of long-standing reflux esophagitis. Most patients have reflux and a hiatus hernia. The diagnosis is strongly suggested by: On the left a patient with a Barrett's esophagus.
The reticular mucosa is characteristic of Barrett's columnar metaplasia, especially with the associated web-like (arrow) stricture. On the left a patient with a Barrett's esophagus with an adenocarcinoma. There are abnormal distal mucosal folds. The upper margin of adenocarcinoma makes right angle with esophageal wall (arrow) indicating a mural lesion in patient with GERD and Barrett's esophagus.
Infectious esophagitis:
Candida esophagitis On the left a patient with an infectious esophagitis due to candida. The barium stury shows numerous fine erosions and small plaques due to Candida albicans in immunocompromised patient. Cytomegalovirus esophagitis On the left an AIDS patient with an infectious esophagitis due to Cytomegalovirus. Such giant ulcers can also be due to HIV alone. Crohn's esophagitis On the left a patient with Crohn's disease. There is a granulomatous esophagitis with aphthous ulcers (arrows). This is an uncommon manifestation of Crohn's disease. The figure on ther right shows the more common colonic aphthous ulcers. TB esophagitis On the left a patient with an infectious esophagitis due to primary TB. There is an irregular sinus tract from proximal esophagus (arrow). Chest radiograph shows enlarged lymph nodes widening mediastinum due to primary tuberculosis.
Pseudodiverticulosis:
Dilated mural glands or pseudodiverticulosis, is usually associated with histologic or endoscopic signs of inflammation, and many patients have strictures due to GERD. On the left a patient with esophageal pseudodiverticulosis. Eosinophilic esophagitis This diagnosis may be suggested by peripheral eosinophilia and confirmed by > 20 eosinophils per HPF on biopsy. Patients often have dysphagia and allergies. Imaging finding include diffuse narrowing, strictures, and a ringed appearance similar to transverse (feline esophagus) folds that are transient or associated with reflux. Steroid therapy is often curative. On the left a patient with eosinophilic esophagitis. There is diffuse distal narrowing and corrugated margins (arrows) due to ring-like indentations, that are characteristic of eosinophilic esophagitis. Glycogen acanthosis Glycogen acanthosis Glycogen plaques are frequently seen at endoscopy. The reported
incidence at endoscopy is 5 to 15% of all patients. These benign epithelial collections of glycogen produce small mucosal nodules. 
Nodules are smooth and well-defined. This may be a degenerative process and produces no symptoms. Feline esophagus: A, B: Show fine horizontal esophageal folds; C: Later image during study no longer shows folds Feline esophagus The delicate, concentric and transiently appearing folds of a feline esophagus should be distinguished from the thicker, interrupted, fixed folds indicative of longitudinal scarring from reflux esophagitis.

Cardiac Anatomy:
Tineke Willems and Marieke Hazewinkel
Radiology department of the University Medical Centre Groningen and the Medical Centre Alkmaar, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2009-02-13 This review is based on a presentation given by Tineke Willems and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Marieke Hazewinkel. We will discuss: The cardiac anatomy in the order of normal blood flow: from the right to the left. Cardiac Axes
Cardiac Axes:
Axial slices through the heart Cardiac CT with ECG triggering offers good image quality of the heart when compared to CT performed for other purposes. As in any other field of radiology, analysis of the acquired images requires a systematic approach. First of all, it is important to understand that the orientation of the heart in the human body differs from that of other anatomic structures: the right ventricle, for example, does not lie completely on the right, but more anterior. The left ventricle does not lie on the left, but more posterior. Also, the heart does not always maintain the same position within the mediastinum - in young people it tends to have a vertical orientation, whereas in older people it tends to rest on the diaphragm, a more horizontal orientation. Cardiologists analyze the heart using cardiac axes. These axes are also used in cardiac CT/MR and must be reconstructed in order to assess the heart properly. Axial slices, such as those imaged on the left, are useful for a global assessment of the morphology of the heart and its relation to the pericardium. 4-chamber view. RA=right atrium, RV=right ventricle, LA=left atrium, LV=left ventricle
4-chamber view:
On the left is a 4-chamber view, achieved by rotating upwards from the apex of the heart on the axial slices. In this axis, the right ventricle is projected next to the right atrium, and the left ventricle next to the left atrium. The mitral valve comes into view and - depending on the contrast protocol - the tricuspid valve may also be visible. Another feature of this cardiac axis is that the apex of the heart is well demarcated.
Note that the apex is formed by the left ventricle. 3-chamber view. LA=left atrium, Ao=aorta, LV=left ventricle
3-chamber view:
When the border between the mitral and aortic valves is localized on the axial slices and the images are rotated from this point, a 3-chamber view like the image on the left can be reconstructed. On this image, the left atrium, left ventricle, mitral-, aortic valve and proximal aorta ascendens are visible. 5-chamber view. RA=right atrium, RV=right ventricle, Ao=aorta, LA=left atrium, LV=left ventricle
5-chamber view:
On the left is an image of a 5-chamber view, which is similar to the 4-chamber view, but additionally displays the aortic valve and left ventricular outflow tract. This view is achieved by rotating the 4-chamber view a little more cranially. 2-chamber view. LA=left atrium, LV=left ventricle
2-chamber view:
The 2-chamber view in the image on the left is achieved by rotating the images perpendicularly to the mitral valve and parallel to the cardiac septum. This axis gives an overview of the left atrium ventricle and mitral valve. It is a good view for analyzing ventricular function, especially that of the inferior and anterior walls. For attaining functional data, consecutive short axes must be reconstructed making use of the 3- and 4-chamber views.
Cardiac anatomy from right to left:
Axial (left) and coronal oblique (right) reconstructions of the heart, depicting the right atrium and its main contributing blood vessels: the coronary sinus (blue arrow) and superior and inferior vena cava. IVC=inferior vena cava, A=anterior, SVC=superior vena cava
Right atrium:
The cardiac anatomy will be discussed in the order of normal blood flow: from the right to the left. In the normal situation, contrast will be injected intravenously - usually in the arm - reaching the right atrium via the superior vena cava. The right atrium has an anterolateral position in the heart, and lies inferior to the left atrium. The superior vena cava enters through the roof of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava enters the right atrium from below near the cardiac septum. Another structure that carries blood towards the right atrium is the coronary sinus, (venous return of the coronaries) which enters anterior to, and just to the left of the inferior vena cava. Axial (left) and coronal (right) reconstructions showing the crista terminalis (blue arrows) and its location in the right atrium
Crista terminalis:
In the right atrium lies the crista terminalis, a muscular ridge that runs from the entrance of the superior- to that of the inferior vena cava. This structure separates the smooth part of the right atrium - the sinus venosus - from the trabecularized right atrial appendage.
On the images on the left it is visible as a smooth linear structure (blue arrows). This is not always the case, however, it may simulate a mass. Axial (left) and coronal oblique (right) reconstructions showing the coronary sinus as it enters the right atrium (blue arrows). A=anterior, P=posterior
Coronary sinus:
The coronary sinus is the main draining vein of the myocardium. It runs in the atrioventricular groove on the posterior surface of the heart and enters the right atrium in the vicinity of the tricuspid valve. On the left is a reconstruction illustrating the course run by the coronary sinus in the atrioventricular groove on the posterior surface of the heart. Axial (left) and 3D-reconstructions (right) of the heart demonstrating the right atrial appendage (blue arrows). Ao=aorta, LA=left atrium
Right atrial appendage:
The right atrial appendage is the trabecularized part of the right atrium. It partially covers the atrioventricular groove and the right coronary artery that runs in it. 
Characteristically, it is flat and triangular in shape and contains small muscular bundles which run parallel to the atrium itself. Axial (left) and sagittal oblique (right) reconstructions showing the right ventricle. The blue arrows indicate the moderator band. RA=right atrium, RV=right ventricle, LV=left ventricle
Right ventricle:
Blood leaves the right atrium and enters the right ventricle via the tricuspid valve. This valve has three leaflets and three papillary muscles, which partially insert on the septum (in contrast to the papillary muscles of the mitral valve, which do not). The right ventricle is shaped differently to the left ventricle: the left ventricle is cylindrical in shape and the cavity of the right ventricle is effectively wrapped around it. The right ventricle also has a thinner wall which is more trabecularized, especially towards the apex. The moderator band is another distinguishing feature of the right ventricle.
It runs from the septum to the lateral wall of the right ventricle, and plays a key role in the electrophysiological conduction of the right ventricle's free wall (blue arrows). Reconstruction showing the tricuspid (TV) and pulmonary (PV) valves as well as the cavity of the right ventricle (RV). The blue arrow indicates the crista supraventricularis
Pulmonary valve:
Next, blood runs towards the pulmonary valve - first entering the smooth, muscular infundibulum of the right ventricle. The pulmonary valve has three cusps, and is separated from the tricuspid valve by a thick muscle known as the crista supraventricularis (blue arrow in the image on the left). This differs from the left ventricular outflow tract, where the mitral and aortic valves lie side by side. On the left is a summary of the characteristics which are specific for the right ventricle and are useful in distinguishing the left from the right ventricle in cases with complex congenital cardiac anatomy. Axial reconstructions showing the pulmonary veins (blue arrows) as they enter the left atrium
Pulmonary veins:
Oxygen-rich blood enters the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. In most cases, there are two pulmonary veins on the left and two on the right. The middle pulmonary veins usually drain into the superior pulmonary vein. 3D-reconstructions showing the pulmonary veins as they enter the left atrium There are frequent variations in pulmonary vein anatomy however, especially on the right, where an anomalous insertion is associated with atrial fibrillation. Axial and 3D-reconstructions illustrating the shape and location of the left atrial appendage (yellow arrows).)
Left atrial appendage:
The left atrial appendage is a finger like, trabecularized structure which originates supralaterally in the left atrium. It lies over the left atrioventricular groove, and partially covers the left coronary artery in it. Its small, parallel-running muscles should not be mistaken for thrombus. 3D-reconstructions showing the left atrial appendage (blue arrow) and the left coronary artery (yellow arrow) after the left atrial appendage has been removed. A=anterior, S=superior).) When assessing the coronary arteries, the left atrial appendage must be removed, so that the LCX and proximal LAD may be visualized. Axial (left) reconstruction, 3-chamber view (middle) and coronal reconstruction (right) of the heart illustrating the relationships between the left atrium, ventricle and aortic root. LA=left atrium, R=right coronary cusp, L=left coronary cusp, N=non-coronary cusp, Ao=aorta, LV=left ventricle
Left ventricle:
Blood enters the left ventricle via the mitral valve. This is a complex valve, consisting of an annulus and posterior and anterior leaflets. The leaflets are connected to the papillary muscles via cord-like tendons called chordae tendinae. The papillary muscles insert into the lateral and posterior walls as well as the apex of the left ventricle. In normal situations the left ventricle has a uniform thickness, varying end-diastolically from 0.6 to 1.0 cm. Blood enters the aortic valve via the left ventricular outflow tract. Note that there appears to be a fibrous connection between the mitral and aortic valve. 3-chamber (left) and coronal (right) reconstructions, same as above
Aortic valve:
Like the pulmonary valve, the aortic valve has three cusps. Just cranially to it there is a slight dilatation of the aortic root. This is the sinus of Valsalva. It fills with blood during diastole, supplying the coronary arteries with oxygen-rich blood. The image on the right shows that the coronary arteries originate fairly cranially, on the border of the ascending aorta. Axial reconstruction depicting the tricuspid aortic valve with its right and left coronary (R and L respectively) and non-coronary cusp (N) The cusps of the aortic valves are named according to their relationship with the coronary arteries, namely the right coronary, left coronary and non-coronary cusp (R, L and N). by Benoit Desjardins and Ella A.

Sharp foreign bodies in GI tract:
by Julien Puylaert and Frank Zijta
Amsterdam UMC and Haaglanden MC, The Hague:
Publicationdate 15 nov 2020 This is an overview of the widely variable US and CT  presentation of sharp foreign bodies perforating the wall of stomach or bowel. 
This pictorial essay is based on a literature search and our personal experience with 49 cases and will enable you to make the correct diagnosis, to understand the natural course and also to help the clinician to choose the best and least invasive treatment. For critical comments and additional remarks:  j.puylaert@gmail.com
Introduction:
Accidental ingestion of sharp foreign bodies is a potentially life-threatening event.  
If a sharp foreign body gets stuck in the pharynx or esophagus, the patient will usually notice its presence and will seek medical help immediately. If, however,  the sharp foreign body, unnoticed by the patient,  is able to reach the stomach, it may penetrate at some point, the wall of the stomach, small or large bowel, giving rise to atypical and treacherous symptoms. 
This often leads to serious delay and may even be fatal. This table contains the key points in the history of the patient. 
The ingested foreign bodies are fish or poultry bones and wooden sticks as tooth picks and cocktail sticks.  
Patients virtually never remember swallowing, and even show disbelief when confronted with the diagnosis. The average age is 60 years and many patients wear denture plates. 
Patients with perforation of small or large bowel often have a previous laparotomy in their history. Perforating foreign bodies in stomach and bowel are rarely clinically considered and are increasingly recognized by the use of US and CT, so there is a key role for the radiologist, in primary detection and also in guiding minimal invasive treatment. This table contains the key points in the clinical, US and CT findings. Pain is variable and atypical. 
CRP usually rises quickly in the first 24 hours. Perforation of the stomach always occurs in the prepyloric region. 
Abscesses may occur in the peritoneal cavity, abdominal wall,  iliopsoas muscle and liver. 
The foreign body itself may be rather inconspicuous and is easily missed. 
This requires awareness and active searching on CT scan This table contains the key points of the treatment. Whenever possible, endoscopical removal is the best option, followed by minimal invasive surgery, guided by the US and CT findings. 
Abscesses can be drained percutaneously, or evacuated surgically together with removal of the foreign body. In all instances, antibiotics are mandatory. 
Antibiotics alone may be the definitive treatment, especially in case of small fish bones  and after successful abscess drainage. Rarely, the sharp foreign body may cause local perforation and yet leave the bowel naturally.
This is called pinprick-and-pass.
Epidemiology and pathophysiology:
Hyperdense bones in three asymptomatic patients It is unknown how often sharp foreign bodies on their journey through the GI tract actually perforate stomach and bowel. 
Probably many fishbones eventually pass with the stool without any problem. 
When specifically looked for, it is not uncommon to find hyperdense bones (arrow) in the bowel lumen, as in these three asymptomatic patients. The most frequently encountered penetrating sharp foreign bodies are fish bones, chicken bones and wooden sticks as toothpicks or cocktail sticks. The vast majority of patients do not recall having swallowed such an object, and when confronted with the sharp object, often show remarkable disbelief. Many patients wear denture plates that might render their palatum less sensitive. It is not always possible to differentiate bones from wooden sticks on CT, but fishbones are generally rather hyperdense and curvilinear, while wooden sticks are less hyperdense and more straight. Half of the patients with small bowel perforation, have a history of a previous abdominal surgery. Adhesions cause local kinking of the bowel loops inhibiting the sharp foreign body to “take the corner”. Once a sharp object penetrates the wall of stomach or bowel, omentum and mesentery will try to wall-off the ensuing perforation. Often, an abscess will develop:  in the peritoneal cavity, in the liver, in the abdominal wall or  in the iliopsoas muscle. The foreign body may lie within the abscess, but also remain at its periphery. Sometimes, significant migration of the object may occur. One third of the perforating sharp foreign bodies lies within reach of either gastroscopy or colonoscopy. This is obviously the best option for the patient. A 59-year old woman with atypical upper epigastric pain for two days. US reveals remarkable wall thickening of the prepyloric antrum, harbouring a hyperechoic, curvilinear structure (arrowheads), suspect for a fishbone. CT confirms the diagnosis. 
Note how the fishbone (arrow) could easily be missed on the coronal CT alone.
Uneventful  recovery after endoscopic removal. US and CT show a fishbone perforating the stomach wall just before the pylorus. At gastroscopy no fishbone was found, but only local mucosal swelling with a central ulceration (arrow). Deep instrumentation with a  large forceps into this area eventually succeeded in grabbing the fishbone. A 74-year old woman presents with deeply located, lower abdominal pain since 3 weeks. Lab: 15 leukocytes, CRP 150. She had multiple gynaecological operations in the past. CT was done and revealed a bony foreign body, which, at both ends, appeared to perforate the sigmoid. Endovaginal US confirmed that the foreign body traversed the sigmoid lumen, so colonoscopic removal was possible. During the endoscopical procedure, the chicken bone had to be broken in two parts in order to be safely removed. Uneventful recovery with help of antibiotics. If the foreign body is not reachable for the endoscope and is well accessible for the surgeon,  in principle surgical removal of the foreign body is indicated. This 33-year old man (with a previous bowel resection at age four) presented with epigastric pain and a CRP of 155. US and CT confirmed a bony structure (arrows) perforating an adhesive small bowel. At mini-laparotomy a sharp 6 cm bone was removed. The patient ate Peking duck two days earlier. A vital 83-year old man presented with acute upper abdominal pain and a CRP of 90. CT found a bony structure stuck in the jejunum. After 24 hours of conservative therapy with antibiotics, the pain did not diminish and the CRP went up to 230. At surgery a sharp, perforating bone chip could easily be removed by means of a small jejunal incision, there was no need for bowel resection. The patient made a quick recovery and now, eleven years later, at 94, he  is still in perfect condition. He can still not imagine that he ever swallowed such a large bone chip In case of deeply located abscesses as liver abscesses, percutaneous drainage is indicated in combination with long-term antibiotics. In some patients  this may be the definitive treatment. This 61-year old lady presented with a large fishbone-related liver abscess. She was obese and had several other contraindications for surgery. After multiple percutaneous drainage procedures and ten weeks of antibiotics, she eventually recovered, with the fishbone still in place, apparently encapsulated. Now, ten years later, she is still doing fine. At times, it may be very difficult to find the foreign body at laparoscopy or open surgery. This patient presented with upper abdominal pain and a CRP of 245. US and CT revealed a slightly hyperdense, straight foreign body, probably a cocktail stick (arrowheads) . At surgery two days later the liver abscess was evacuated, but the foreign body was not found. Afterwards  the patient did well on antibiotics. On day 15, CT showed resolution of the abscess with the foreign body (arrowheads) still in situ. Eventually, the patient recovered with long-term antibiotic treatment. Wooden sticks incidentally may be isodense with the bowel or liver tissue they traverse, and thus may be hardly or not visible on CT scan. In these cases, focused US can be of help. In patient A, CT findings of an air-bubble, fat stranding and local bowel wall thickening, suggested a local perforation, but no foreign body was seen. Immediate US of this area  unequivocally revealed a sharp foreign body (arrows) piercing through the bowel (b.) wall into the surrounding inflamed fat (*). In patient B, antral wall thickening and a nearby liver abscess, suggested a perforating foreign body, which however could not be identified on CT. US, performed with knowledge of the CT findings, easily detected the, apparently isodense, foreign body. (st. = stomach) Often no abscess occurs and the fishbone, after migration, becomes encapsulated. Antibiotics may be of help in the encapsulation process. This 48 year old woman was submitted with severe periumbilical pain since 12 hours (Lab: 15 leukocytes, CRP 7). 
The next day the pain subsided, but the CRP went up to 65. US of the periumbilical area, showed edematous wall thickening of small bowel (b.) with normal peristalsis. 
There was a tiny fluid collection (f.) and inflammation of the  hyperechoic and non-compressible mesentery (*). Subsequent CT confirmed small bowel wall thickening (b.) and fat stranding (*) in the mesentery. In the left paracolic gutter, a fishbone (arrow) was found. 
Apparently the fishbone, after perforating the jejunum, did migrate to that spot. 
Subsequent laparoscopical exploration was unable to identify the fishbone. 
She made an uneventful recovery with antibiotics. CT scan, performed for other reasons 18 months later, showed slight migration of the fish bone, apparently well-encapsulated. 
Patient is still doing well eight years later. In case of relatively mild symptoms in patients with small, perforating fishbones without an abscess, primary antibiotic treatment  may be a good first option. These three different patients all made an uneventful recovery with antibiotics only. Sometimes nature is very mild. 
This 72 year old lady presented with acute epigastric pain and a CRP of 180, caused by a fishbone, perforating her stomach. Only proton pump inhibitors were given. 
Her symptoms rapidly subsided and her CRP was normal again in three days. 
She  made a full recovery, and 11 years later is still doing fine. Two different patients with an encapsulated fishbone in the wall of the antrum as coincidental finding on CT, performed for other reasons. Both patients did not recall a period of upper epigastric pain and had unchanged CT images for many years. In case of an abdominal wall abscess, surgery can be done in order  to drain the abscess and remove the foreign body. In this patient, only a small peri-umbilical incision allowed evacuation of pus and removal of the fishbone. This 58-year old patient presented with pain LLQ and a CRP of 105, suspect for diverticulitis. US found a ovoid mass of inflamed fat (arrowheads) lateral of the sigmoid, suggestive of epiploic appendagitis. Subsequent CT revealed a straight, hyperdense foreign body (arrows)  surrounded by fat stranding.
The patient was treated with antibiotics. One week later an abscess did develop, which was percutaneously drained. Eight weeks later a cocktail stick was removed as an elective procedure.
Perforating diseases of the GI tract:

Causes of perforation:
If at US or CT bowel wall thickening is found in combination with fat stranding, free air configurations and/or abscess formation, it is not always clear what the underlying cause is. The mnemonic PSI-ABCD may be helpful: In the table, the star-classification indicate the frequency of these potentially perforating conditions.
In 99,99 % of cases, one of these seven conditions is the cause of the perforation or walled-off perforation. In our hospital we have a relatively large number of sharp, perforating foreign bodies of 3-4 cases per year. 
This is partially explained by a large immigrant population, eating exotic fish species. Especially Surinamese people who make up 30 % of our patients, are responsible for 70% of the fishbone perforations.
Pinprick-and-pass:
A sharp foreign body may cause a perforation, but may yet pass normally with the stool  (”pinprick-and-pass”). This 85-year old man presented with severe localized pain, focal peritonitis and a CRP of 200, clinically suspect for appendicitis.  
US showed a small focal area of inflamed hyperechoic fat (arrowheads), harbouring  a little fluid (*) and an ill-understood reflection (white arrow). 
The presumed US diagnosis was epiploic appendagitis with a small central area of hemorrhage. CT confirmed local fat stranding and  detected an air bubble as well as slight wall thickening of a neighbouring small bowel loop.   
Using the mnemonic PSI-ABCD, all conditions were excluded, except for a sharp foreign body. After specific searching a fishbone was detected in the cecum (green arrows on CT). Apparently, this fishbone had caused a perforation, and was later propelled by some small bowel contents. The patient was treated with antibiotics only and made a full recovery.
Illustrative cases:
This 37-year old woman had progressive epigastric pain since 4 days. US detected a reflective curvilinear structure (arrowheads) reaching from the stomach (st.) into the swollen pancreas, suspect for a fishbone. (gb=gallbladder). 
CT without contrast confirmed a fishbone stuck in the pancreas. At gastroscopy, no fishbone was seen, only a small mucosal defect producing some fibrin strands. 
We assumed that this was the point where the fishbone must have penetrated while the remaining end of the fishbone got “buried” in the reactively swollen mucosa of the posterior stomach wall (see drawing). Encouraged by this knowledge the endoscopist performed deep instrumentation with a large forceps, which eventually was successful. 
The patient made a full recovery and told us having eaten “jarabaka”  a week earlier, a Surinamese fish, known for its delicious taste and its sharp bones. A 81-year old man with progressive epigastric pain for 24 hours. 
US revealed an aortic aneurysm of 5.2 cm. Immediate CT scan excluded rupture, however some subtle fat stranding anterior of the duodenum was seen around a small hyperdense structure. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll CT revealed a fishbone (arrow) in the duodenum, perforating its ventral wall. At gastroscopy the fishbone was easily recognized and removed. Note the greenish discoloration of the fishbone due to bile pigments. When confronted with the results, the patient could not imagine ever having swallowed such a large fishbone. A 50 year old man with pain LLQ and  a CRP of 21, suspect for diverticulitis. Initial US shows wall thickening of the sigmoid, inflamed fat (*) and a fecolith within a diverticulum (white arrowhead). 
Closer inspection of the area where the most inflamed, non-compressible fat (green arrowheads and *) was seen, revealed a foreign body (arrows). CT without contrast confirmed a piece of bone and subtle fat stranding (*) around the sigmoid. Endoscopic removal was relatively easy. This is a 60-year old woman with high fever and clinically possible pancreatitis. CT scan showed an abscess in the quadrate lobe, harbouring a fishbone, migrated from the stomach to the liver. Endoscopic US confirmed the fishbone entirely within the liver abscess (arrow), so endoscopic removal was impossible. At surgery, the abscess was drained and the fishbone removed. A 75 year old man with a clinically suspected iliopsoas abscess. CT confirms the abscess and identified a straight, slightly hyperdense sharp foreign body, apparently migrated from the small bowel to the iliac muscle.
Shape and density suggested a wooden pen rather than a fishbone. With only minimal invasive surgery, both pus and wooden pen were removed. 
Patient had artificial denture, a previous appendectomy and had the habit of “shoving-off” meat of his sateh-pen with a fork. A 53-year old man presented with a painful LLQ swelling and a CRP of 173, suspect for diverticulitis.
He had a left nefrectomy 20 years ago. US revealed an abscess in the abdominal wall harbouring a thin, curvilinear structure (arrow). CT without and with i.v. contrast, confirms a fishbone (arrow) within a moderately defined, abdominal wall abscess. 
Note how easily the fishbone could have been missed if only i.v. contrast CT had been made. Location of abscess and fishbone were indicated on the skin. 
Using only a very small incision, pus and fishbone could be removed. Uneventful recovery. A 57-year old man (previous appendectomy) with suspected diverticulitis. CT showed thickening of the sigmoid (s.) wall and an unclear mass at the left side. 
At this time, the small hyperechoic line (arrow) was missed. 
The CT diagnosis was sigmoid diverticulitis or sigmoid malignancy. 
Colonoscopy was unable to reach the area. On a repeated CT one week later, we were lucky that the straight and slightly hyperechoic sharp foreign body (arrows) now presented in its full length on the coronal CT. At surgery, part of the sigmoid was resected together with a large inflammatory mass, harbouring the causative wooden cocktail stick. 
A temporary stoma was made. 
The patient showed disbelief and firmly denied ever having swallowed such a stick. During an endodontal procedure by his dentist, this 46 year old man accidently swallowed an “endofile”.
He had no abdominal complaints, but became worried when, after a week, he did not find it in his stool. CT without contrast confirmed perforation of a jejunal loop, with only minimal fat stranding. At surgery a part of the jejunum was resected including the endofile. Young (31 years) Surinamese woman with 3 weeks of pain LLQ and CRP 55, suspect for adnexitis or diverticulitis. 
Previous history of uterine rupture. US shows hypoechoic mass left of the uterus (u.) suspect for tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). 
In the periphery a thin, curvilinear reflection (arrows) is seen. Endovaginal US confirms a fishbone (arrows) in the wall of the TOA. Non-contrast CT reveals  that the TOA  has a close relation to the sigmoid, which also shows focal wall thickening. At surgery, TOA  and fishbone, densely adhered to the sigmoid, were removed. Apparently, the fishbone, after perforating the sigmoid, migrated into the left ovary, causing a TOA. 
Note the greenish discoloration of the fishbone, probably due to biliary pigments. Obese 80 year old lady with strong clinical suspicion of appendicitis. 
She had a previous cholecystectomy. 
Lab: leukocytes 21, CRP 125. US showed inflamed fat (*) around edematous small bowel (b.), containing a strange reflective structure (arrows). 
The US images in two perpendicular planes, suggested that this foreign body had a flat nature. CT confirmed small bowel wall thickening, fat stranding and extra-luminal air. Closer inspection in the axial and coronal CT plane, revealed an intraluminally localized, slightly hyperdense, double-layered flat structure (arrows) of unknown origin. Surgery revealed focal small bowel usuration by a sharp vegetable peel. 
After the operation, this was recognized by the patient as the peel of an unripe mango, used in her self-made mango chutney. Man of 79 years old, two days hospitalized for myocardial infarction, suddenly developed pain in the RLQ and a CRP of 70, suspect for appendicitis.
He was nursed in isolation for suspected MRSA. US showed a normal appendix of 4 mms and wall thickening of the terminal ileum, surrounded by inflamed fat (*). 
Next to the ileum a possible air bubble (green arrow) was observed. Within the ileal lumen, a linear reflective structure (arrowheads) was found. 
The aspect in multiple planes, suggested a flat foreign body. On one end, a apparently sharp edge (white arrow) stuck out into the surrounding inflamed fat (*). Enable Scroll

Perianal Fistulas:
Susanne Tonino and Robin Smithuis
Radiology Department of the Medical Centre Alkmaar and the Rijnland hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands.:
Publicationdate 2009-01-21 Perianal fistula is a common disorder that often recurs because of infection that was missed at surgery. Preoperative MR can help to prevent recurrence. In this review we will address the anatomy, pathogenesis, classification and scanning protocol of perianal fistulas. by Susanne Tonino and Robin Smithuis
Anatomy:
The anatomical anal canal extends from the perineal skin to the linea dentata. Surgically, the anal canal extends from the perineal skin to the anorectal ring. This is the circular upper border of the puborectal muscle which is digitally palpable upon rectal examination. The anorectal ring lies approximately 1-1,5 cm above the linea dentata. The total length of the surgical anal canal is about 4-5 cm. The anal sphincter is comprised of three layers: Puborectal muscle forming a 'sling' The puborectal muscle has its origin on both sides of the pubic symphysis, forming a 'sling' around the anorectum. The puborectal muscle is contracted at rest and accounts for the 80? angulation of the anorectal junction. It relaxes during defecation. Coronal T2W-image On axial and coronal MR-images the different layers of the anal sphincter and the surrounding structures can be displayed perfectly.
Perianal fistula:
A perianal fistula is an abnormal connection between the epithilialised surface of the anal canal and the skin. The causes of perianal fistulas:
Classification:
The most widely used classification is the Parks Classification which distinguishes four kinds of fistula: intersphincteric, transsphincteric, suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric. The most common fistulas are the intersphincteric and the transsphincteric. The extrasphincteric fistula is uncommon and only seen in patients who had multiple operations. In these cases the connection with the original fistula tract to the bowel is lost. A superficial fistula is a fistula that has no relation to the sphincter or the perianal glands and is not part of the Parks classification. These are more often due to Crohns disease or anorectal procedures such as haemorrhoidectomy or sphincterotomy.
MR Protocol and Reporting:
Protocol A localizer in three directions is needed in order to align the T2 sequences axial and coronal to the anal canal. Any localizer that properly displays the anal canal can be used. We use a TRUE FISP, which is the name that Siemens uses for a steady-state precession gradient-echo sequence (GE: FIESTA, Philips: balanced FFE). Perianal fistula: axial T2WI without fatsat (left) and with fatsat (right) T2W images without fatsat better display the anatomy, while the fatsat images better depict the fistulas. Reporting When you describe a fistula, it is important to mention the following characteristics: The drawing on the left illustrates the anal clock, which is the surgeon's view of the perianal region when the patient is in the supine lithotomy position (2). This scheme corresponds to the orientation of axial MR images of the perianal region.
Examples of Perirectal Fistulas:

Intersphincteric fistula:
On the left axial T2W images with and without fat saturation. An intersphincteric fistula is located at 6 o'clock. Continue with coronal images. On the coronal image the fistula runs caudally towards the skin. There is no connection with the external sphincter. Enable Scroll

Transsphincteric fistula:
On the left an axial T2WI and T2WI + fatsat of a transsphincteric fistula. The defect through the internal and external sphincter at 6 o'clock is clearly visible and more apparent on the fat sat images. Transsphincteric fistula with sphincter defect at 11 o'clock On the left axial T2W-fatsat images of a transsphincteric fistula with the mucosal opening at 11 o'clock. On the left an example of a suprasphincteric fistula. There are two tracts in the ischioanal region. The right sided tract runs over the puborectal muscle (asterisk) and the mucosal opening lies at the
level of the linea dentata (black arrow).
Extrasphincteric fistula:
On the left coronal T2W-images of a small abscess in the left ischioanal fossa, the fistula runs through the levator ani. It is therefore above the sphincter complex and extrasphincteric. Enable Scroll

Complex fistula:
On the left an example of a complex fistula. Two tracts in the left buttock form a single tract (no. 1-2). This fistula breaks through the external sphincter (no. 4). In the intersphincteric space it divides again into two tracts (no. 5). One ends blindly in the intersphincteric space (no. 6). The other breaks through the internal sphincter with the mucosal defect at 1 o'clock.
Crohn's disease:
On the left a patient with a perianal fistula who has Crohn's disease. Continue with the coronal images. On the coronal images the thickening of the bowel wall is demonstrated. Axial fatsat images depict the transmural inflammation with infiltration of the mesenteric fat.
Treatment:
Treatment is focussed on the elimination of the primary and secondary tracts, prevention of
recurrence and to retain continence. The treatment given depends on the anatomy of the fistula, if it is a simple fistula with a
low mucosal defect is can be probed in the OR to identify the mucosal defect at the
linea dentata, then the tract can be opened. This is only possible if the external sphincter is not involved. Seton fistulotomy is a technique where a rubber ligature or vessel loop is pulled through the
fistula, it then is tightened every 2 weeks or so in order to obtain pressure necrosis so that
the Seton is slowly pulled through the muscle. This has the advantage that the muscle is slowly cut and fibroses at the same time in order
to cause as little damage as possible to the sphincter complex. If there is an extrasphincteric fistula, the lower part is opened. The mucosal defect, which is by definition in the rectum, is then surgically closed. This patient was already known to have an intersfincteric fistula, the mucosal defect is at 1 o'clock. In the tract there is a linear structure with a low signal intensity. This is the Seton which was inserted to treat the fistula.
Differential diagnosis:
Sinus pilonidalis Sinus pilonidalis On the left an example of a sinus pilonidalis. There is a small abscess just above the nates. There is no relation with the sphincter complex. Proctitis On the left images of a patient who presented with anal complaints. No fistula was seen. There is, however, a diffuse thickening of the rectal mucosa due to a proctitis.

Nonvascular Mediastinal Masses:
Marilyn J. Siegel and Valerie Niehe
Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, St. Louis, MO and the Medical Centre Haaglanden in the Hague, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2011-07-10 This review is based on a presentation by Marilyn Siegel and was adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Valerie Niehe. Marilyn Siegel is specialized in pediatric and chest radiology. In this review we will discuss the most common non-vascular mediastinal masses in the chest. In Pediatric Chest CT part II we will discuss the most common vascular anomalies of the aorta, pulmonary vessels and systemic veins in the chest.
Differential diagnosis:
The differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass is based on identifying its location in anterior, middle or posterior mediastinum and attenuation: soft tissue, fat, fluid and enhancement.
Normal anatomy:

Thymus:
In infants and young children (
In older children, the thymus gradually assumes a triangular or arrowhead configuration with straight or concave margins. By 15 years of age it is triangular in nearly all individuals. Marked lobularity of the thymus is always abnormal. In prepubertal children, the thymus is homogeneous. The attenuation value is equal to that of skeletal muscle. In adolescents it may be heterogeneous, containing areas of fat. Anatomic variations include extension into the posterior mediastinum or upper neck. Clues to the diagnosis are: The figure shows a thymus that extends cranially to the brachiocephalic vessels. It is contiguous with the normal thymus and extend between the superior vena cava and the trachea. There is no mass effect.
Normal Lymph nodes:
There are no well-established data concerning size of normal lymph nodes in infants and young children. Mediastinal lymph nodes are generally not seen on CT prior to puberty. The nodes should then not exceed 1 cm in the widest dimension. The azygoesophageal recess is dextroconvex in children younger than 6 years of age, straight in children between 5 and 12 years of age, and concave in adolescents and adults. Recognizing the normal dextroconvex appearance is important so that it is not mistaken for lymphadenopathy.
Anterior Mediastinal Masses:
Anterior mediastinal masses are usually of thymic origin.
Hodgkin lymphoma:
Lymphoma is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in children, with Hodgkin lymphoma occurring three to four times more frequently than non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Calcifications or cystic areas, due to ischemic necrosis consequent to rapid tumor growth, can be seen. Lymphadenopathy from lymphoma has varied appearances, ranging from mildly enlarged nodes in a single area to large conglomerate soft tissue masses in multiple regions. Thymic enlargement and lymphadenopathy show minimal if any enhancement after intravenous contrast. Additional findings include airway narrowing and compression of vascular structures. PET-CT of Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma in children is more common in the second decade of life. The lymphomatous mass is most common located in the anterior mediastinum and reflects lymphadenopathy or infiltration and enlargement of the thymus. The enlarged thymus has a quadrilateral shape with convex, lobular lateral borders. Hodgkin lymphoma The chest film shows the typical features of Hodgkin lymphoma, e.g., an anterior mediastinal mass. Hodgkin lymphoma The CT-images of the same patient show a large soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinum, which arises in the thymus. There is associated paratracheal adenopathy (arrow). Hodgkin lymphoma Two more cases of Hodgkin lymphoma. Again these cases show an anterior mediastinal mass and paratracheal adenopathy. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma:
Non-Hodgkin disease in children occurs in the first and second decade of life. The disease usually involves the nodes in the chest (paratracheal, subcarinal and hilar). The extension of the disease is not contiguous, it can skip a location. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma Non-Hodgkin disease, in contrast to Hodgkin disease, often spares the thymus. In this case, enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the right paratracheal , hilar and subcarinal areas. Thymic hyperplasia
Thymic hyperplasia:
Thymic hyperplasia is another cause of thymic enlargement.
In childhood, thymic hyperplasia is most often 'rebound' hyperplasia associated with chemotherapy, particularly therapy with corticosteroids. Rebound hyperplasia may be observed during the course of chemotherapy or after therapy completion and occurs 3 to 10 months after the start of chemotherapy. The mechanism of hyperplasia is believed to be initial depletion of lymphocytes from the cortical portion of the gland due to high serum levels of glucocorticoids, followed by repopulation of the cortical lymphocytes when the cortisone levels return to normal. On CT, hyperplasia appears as diffuse enlargement of the thymus, with preservation of the normal triangular shape. The definition of thymic hyperplasia is a > 50 % increase in volume of the thymus.
CT, MRI of PET cannot differentiate rebound hyperplasia from infiltration of the thymus by tumor. The absence of other active disease and a gradual decrease in thymus size on serial CT's supports the diagnosis of rebound hyperplasia. The thymus usually returns to its normal size in 3 to 6 months. LEFT: Thymoma. RIGHT: Thymic carcinoma.
Thymoma:
Thymomas are common and account for 20% of mediastinal neoplasms. Thymic carcinomas are extremely rare and acount for less than 1% of all thymic tumors. The images show a thymoma on the left and a carcinoma on the right. The thymic carcinoma has invaded the superior vena cava (arrow). Benign mature teratoma
Germ-cell tumors:
Germ-cell tumors are the most common cause of a fat containing lesions in the anterior mediastinum and the second most common cause of an anterior mediastinal mass in children. Approximately 90 % are benign germ-cell tumors. Most arise in the thymus. On CT, a benign teratoma is a well-defined, thick-wall cystic mass containing a variable mixture of water, calcium, fat and soft tissue. The soft tissue component in benign teratoma is minimal.
Size is not an indicator of malignancy. Benign mature teratoma Mature teratomas can be very large and still be benign. Malignant teratoma Malignant teratomas make up 10 % of all teratomas.
They tend to have irregular or nodular walls and a predominance of soft tissue components. They also may show pulmonary or liver metastases and chest wall invasion. The most common nonteratomatous germ-cell tumors in the pediatric population are choriocarcinoma, embryonal cell cancer and yolk-sac cancer.
Thymolipoma:
Thymolipoma is an infrequent fat-containing thymic tumor.
At CT, it appears as a heterogeneous mass containing fat and soft tissue elements. Calcifications are absent. Thymolipoma does not have a capsule and does not have any mass effect.
Lymphangioma or Cystic hygroma:
Lymphangiomas are developmental tumors of the lymphatic system. In the mediastinum they are almost always an inferior extension of a cervical lymphangioma. Isolated mediastinal involvement is rare. Lymphangioma is a benign, but aggressive tumor that shows mass effect and may encase vessels and other structures. It typically affects infants younger than 6 months of age. At CT it appears as nonenhancing, thin-walled, multiloculated mass with near water attenuation. T2 with fatsupression, transversal and coronal MRI may sometimes be used to better delineate the extension of the lesion. The MRI in this patient shows a cystic mass in the neck extending into the right axilla and mediastinum. The tumor encases vessels. The presence of contrast enhancement of the wall or internal septations suggests superimposed infection or a hemangiomatous component.
Thymic cysts:
Thymic cysts are usually congenital lesions resulting from persistence of the thymopharyngeal duct. They can also occur after thoracotomy. Typically, they are thinwalled, homogeneous masses of near water attenuation on CT. The attenuation value may be higher than that of simple cysts when the contents are proteinaceous or hemorrhagic rather than serous. In children thymoma, thymic carcinoma and goiter are so uncommon, that you should put them very low in your differential diagnosis.
Middle Mediastinal masses:
In the middle mediastinum we will find foregut duplication cysts or lymph nodes. Foregut cysts in the middle mediastinum are classified as bronchogenic or enteric. Bronchogenic cysts are lined by respiratory epithelium and most are located in the subcarinal or right paratracheal area in close proximity to the trachea or bronchus. Enteric cysts are lined by gastrointestinal mucosa and are located in a paraspinal position in the middle to posterior mediastinum near the esophagus. Bronchogenic Cyst
Bronchogenic Cysts:
The images show a well defined lesion of water attenuation in close proximity to the trachea or bronchus, which is typical for a bronchogenic foregut cyst. Bronchogenic Cysts The images show more examples of bronchogenic cysts and their close proximity to the airway. Enteric cyst
Enteric foregut cyst:
The images show a well defined lesion of water attenuation in the lower mediastinum in close proximity to the esophagus, which is typical for an enteric foregut cyst.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy:
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is usually caused by lymphoma or granulomatous disease. Metastatic disease from rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma or a Wilms tumor, is also a possibility. On CT, adenopathy can appear as discrete, round, soft tissue masses or as a single soft tissue mass with poorly defined margins. Calcification within lymph nodes suggests old healed granulomatous disease, fungal infection or metastatic disease from osteosarcoma. Areas of low attenuation suggest tuberculosis or fungal infection.
Posterior Mediastinal masses:
Posterior mediastinal masses are of neural origin in approximately 95 % of cases and may arise from sympathetic ganglion cells (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma or ganglioneuroma) or from nerve sheaths (neurofibroma or schwannoma). In the first decade of life they are usually malignant, most commonly neuroblastoma. In the second decade or life they are usually benign (ganglioneuroma, neurofibroma, rarely schwanoma). Neuroblastoma presenting as a mass in the posterior mediastinum
Neuroblastoma:
Neuroblastoma typically is fusiform in shape, of soft tissue density; 50% of thoracic tumors have calcifications. Neuroblastoma Neuroblastoma grows over several interspaces and frequently invades the vertebral canal. The CT-images show a calcified mass in the posterior mediastinum extending over several vertebrae, which grows into the vertebral canal. Neuroblastoma On the MR-images the invasion of the vetebral canal is better seen (arrows). LEFT: Ganglioneuroma, RIGHT: Neurofibroma.
Other Neurogenic Tumors:
In the 2nd decade other neurogenic tumors are seen like
ganglioneuroma, neurofibroma and rarely schwanoma. They are round or oval in shape, smaller in size than ganglion cell tumors and usually extend over only one or two vertebrae. Both types of tumor may cause pressure erosion of a rib and invade the spinal canal.
Neurenteric Cyst:
Neurogenic cysts contain neural and gastrointestinal element. They are commonly associated with vertebral anomalies and scoliosis. The cyst does not communicate with CSF. The cyst is well demarcated and has a near water attenuation value on CT and water signal intensity on MRI, as shown in the case on the left. Extramedullary hematopoiesis masses in the paraspinal area and adjacent to the sternum.
Extramedullary hematopoiesis:
Extramedullary hematopoiesis accounts for less than 0.1 % of the lesions in the posterior mediastinum. It is characterized by formation of blood elements outside of the bone marrow. It occurs with severe anemia. On CT it is seen as a paravertebral mass and occurs with coarse bone trabeculation in the adjacent vertebra.

Publicationdate 2014-06-01 Optimal contrast enhancement is important for a succesful diagnostic CT-scan. In this article we will discuss: Discuss a few protocols Basics of contrast-enhancement
Basics of contrast-enhancement:

Disable Scroll Scroll through the phases of enhancement. You can enlarge the images by clicking on it.
Phases of enhancement:
The purpose of contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is to find pathology by enhancing the contrast between a lesion and the normal surrounding structures. Sometimes a lesion will be hypovascular compared to the normal tissue and in some cases a lesion will be hypervascular to the surrounding tissue in a certain phase of enhancement. So it is important to know in which phase a CT should be performed depending on the pathology that you are looking for. Scroll through the images to see the enhancement in the different phases. This is the phase when the contrast is still in the arteries and has not enhanced the organs and other soft tissues.
* Late arterial phase - 35-40 sec p.i. or 15-20 sec after bolustracking. Sometimes also called "arterial phase" or "early venous portal phase", because some enhancement of the portal vein can be seen. All structures that get their bloodsupply from the arteries will show optimal enhancement.
* Hepatic or late portal phase - 70-80 sec p.i. or 50-60 sec after bolustracking. Although hepatic phase is the most accurate term, most people use the term "late portal phase". In this phase the liver parenchyma enhances through bloodsupply by the portal vein and you should see already some enhancement of the hepatic veins.
* Nephrogenic phase - 100 sec p.i. or 80 sec after bolustracking. This is when all of the renal parenchyma including the medulla enhances. Only in this phase you will be able to detect small renal cell carcinomas.
* Delayed phase - 6-10 minutes p.i. or 6-10 minutes after bolustracking. Sometimes called "wash out phase" or "equilibrium phase". There is wash out of contrast in all abdominal structures except for fibrotic tissue, because fibrotic tissue has a poor late wash out and will become relatively dense compared to normal tissue. This is comparable to late enhancement of infarcted scar tissue in cardiac MRI. Hypervascular lesion is best seen in late arterial phase.
Timing of CECT:
Timing of CT-series is important in order to grab the right moment of maximal contrast differences between a lesion and the normal parenchyma. The CT-images show an early arterial phase in comparison to a late arterial phase. The CT-images are of a patient who underwent two phases of arterial imaging at 18 and 35 seconds. In the early arterial phase we nicely see the arteries, but we only see some irregular enhancement within the liver. In the late arterial phase we can clearly identify multiple tumor masses. You have to adapt your protocol to the type of scanner, the speed of contrast injection and to the kind of patient that you are examining. If you have a single slice scanner, it will take about 20 seconds to scan the liver. For late arterial phase imaging 35 sec is the optimal time, so you start at about 25 seconds and end at about 45 seconds. However if you have a 64-slice scanner, you will be able to examine the whole liver in 4 seconds. So you start scanning at about 33 seconds, which is much later. In aterial phase imaging the time window is narrow, since you have only limited time before the surrounding liver will start to enhance and obscure a hypervascular lesion. For Late portal venous phase imaging it is different. Here you don't want to be too early, because you want to load the liver with contrast and it takes time for contrast to get from the portal vein into the liver parenchyma. Besides you have more time, because the delayed or equilibrium phase starts at about 3-4 minutes. So you start at 75 seconds with whatever scanner you have.
Total amount of contrast:
In many protocols a standard dose is given related to the weight of the patient: In some protocols we always want to give the maximum dose of 150cc, like when you are looking for a pancreatic carcinoma or liver metastases. Patient with liver cirrhosis and multifocal HCC injected at 2.5ml/sec (left) and at 5ml/sec (right)
Injection rate:
5cc/sec through a 18 gauge i.v. catheter 3-4cc/sec through a 20 gauge pink venflon The upper images are of a patient with liver cirrhosis and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma examined after contrast injection at 2.5ml/sec. Because of poor enhancement the examination was repeated at 5ml/sec. There is far better contrast enhancement and better tumor detection.
Oral contrast:
Some prefer to give positive oral contrast to mark the bowel. This however has some disadvantages: We use fat containing milk as negative oral contrast or if the patient doesn't drink milk we simply use water. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is also used, and Volumen®, which is a low density barium suspension. PEG and Volumen® have the advantage that there is better bowel distension. The CT-image shows nice enhancement of the normal bowel wall (yellow arrows) and no enhancement of the infarcted bowel (red arrows). This would not be visible if positive oral contrast was given.
Rectal contrast:
Rectal contrast is given in cases of suspected bowel perforation or anastomosis leakage. We use positive contrast: 750 cc water with 50 cc non-ionic water soluable contrast. More information is given in the protocol anastomosis leakage.
Liver:
Hypervascular tumor (left) enhances in late arterial phase. Hypovascular tumor (right) enhances poorly and is best seen in the hepatic phase
Dual blood supply:
The conspicuity of a liver lesion depends on the attenuation difference between the lesion and the normal liver. On a non enhanced CT-scan (NECT) liver tumors are not visible, because the inherent contrast between tumor tissue and the surrounding liver parenchyma is too low. When we give i.v. contrast, it is important to understand, that there is a dual blood supply to the liver. Normal parenchyma is supplied for 80% by the portal vein and only for 20% by the hepatic artery, so the normal parenchyma will enhance maximally in the hepatic phase at 70-80 sec p.i. and only a little bit in the late arterial phase at 35-40 sec p.i.. All liver tumors however get 100% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery. So a hypervascular tumor will be best seen in the late arterial phase. A hypovascular liver tumor however will enhance poorly in the late arterial phase, because it is hypovascular and the surrounding liver does also enhance poorly in that phase. This tumor is best seen when the surrounding tissue enhances, i.e. in the late portal (or hepatic) phase at 75-80 sec p.i. This figure is to summarize the enhancement patterns. In the late arterial phase at 35 sec hypervascular lesions like HCC, FNH, adenoma and hemangioma wil enhance optimally, while the normal parenchyma shows only minimal enhancement. Hypovascular lesions like metastases, cysts and abscesses will not enhance and are best seen in the hepatic phase at 70 sec p.i. Fibrotic lesions like cholangiocarcinoma and fibrotic metastases hold the contrast much longer than normal parenchyma. They are best seen in the delayed phase at 600 sec p.i. This late enhancement is comparable to what is seen in cardiac infarcts in MRI of the heart. If you want to characterize a liver lesion, you need maximum contrast at a maximum flow rate, i.e. 150cc contrast at 5cc/sec. through a 18 gauge green venflon. In most cases you also want to scan the whole abdomen. You can do this either at 35 sec or 70 sec p.i. We do not routinely perform a NECT in order keep the radiation dose as low as possible. When you know in advance, that you are dealing with hypovascular metastases, a hepathic phase at 70 sec p.i. is sufficient.
Pancreas:
Pancreatic carcinoma is best imaged at 35 sec p.i. Liver metastases are best imaged at 70 sec p.i.
Pancreatic carcinoma:
Pancreatic carcinoma is a hypovascular tumor and is best detected in the late arterial phase at 35-40 sec p.i. when the normal glandular tissue enhances optimally and the hypovascular tumor does not. Metastases in the liver are best detected at 70-80 sec p.i., when the liver parenchyma enhances optimally. In some cases it can be difficult to differentiate a pancreatic carcinoma from a focal chronic pancreatitis. A NECT can be included in the protocol to detect calcifications in the pancreas, but we do not use that in our standard protocol. Some radiologists use a longer delay for scanning of the pancreas at 50 sec p.i.
Acute pancreatitis:
Imaging in acute pancreatitis is best done after 72 hours of presentation. read more... Ct performed in the first two days can underestimate the severity of the disease. Necrosis can be best detected in the late arterial phase at 35 sec p.i. CT examination of the pancreas should always be done with maximum amount of contrast at a maximum flow rate, because both small pancreatic carcinomas aswell as pancreatic necrosis in pancreatitis are difficult to detect. It is a matter of personal flavor to do the whole abdomen at 35 sec p.i. or at 70 sec p.i. Some perform one single CT somewhere inbetween 35 and 70 sec, but that is not what we prefer.
Ileus:
Especially in small bowel obstruction (SBO) you need to answer the most important question: is there strangulation? To answer that question, you need a contrast enhanced CT for the following reasons: Do not use positive oral contrast, because this will obscure bowel wall enhancement. The coronal reconstruction nicely shows bowel wall enhancement in a patient with ileus due to a small bowel obstruction. Notice the cluster of thick walled loops with poor enhancement and edema of the mesentery (red circle). This is a closed loop obstruction with strangulation. This patient needs immediate surgery. If this patient would have been given positive oral contrast, you probably would not have notice the ischemic bowel. Read more about closed loop obstruction.
Anastomosis leakage:
Leakage after bowel surgery is a great clinical problem. Patients, who are suspected of leakage, need the best CT-protocol they can get and you as a radiologist need the best images to convince the clinician. You do not want to tell the surgeon that there is probably leakage, but you are not sure. A NECT without any oral or rectal contrast is needed to compare with the CECT with rectal contrast, because you don't want to end up in a discussion whether some hyperdense stuff outside the bowel is leakage or some post-operative material, dense bowel content or contrast from an earlier examination.

Here a patient with an anastomosis in the lower abdomen after resection of a sigmoid carcinoma. Compare the NECT without oral or rectal contrast on the left with the images on the right after rectal contrast. There is no doubt, that contrast in the fluid collection in the right lower abdomen is the result of leakage from the bowel (arrow).
Pulmonary emboli:
Good quality CT scanning is the most important factor for the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli. On a poor quality scan it is impossible to rule out emboli. We prefer to scan from bottom to top, because if a patient can't hold his breath, then you will have less breathing artefacts in the lower lobes, where most of the emboli are located. In the upper lobes breathing does not cause that much movement as in the lower parts of the lung. We ask the patient to breath in normally and hold his breath to avoid the transient interruption of contrast, which will be explained in a moment. For good timing bolus tracking is needed. A ROI is placed in the pulmonary trunk. When the treshhold of 150 HU is reached, the patient is asked to breath in and scanning is started immediately. Transient Interruption of Contrast: Deep inspiration results in dilution of contrast in the right atrium by unopacified blood from the inferior vena cava.
Transient interruption of contrast:
TIC is a flow artefact, that consists of relatively poor contrast enhancement in the pulmonary arteries, while there is good enhancement in the SVC and also in the aorta, which seems not logic at all. This vascular phenomenon occurs when the patient performs a deep inspiration just before the scan starts, resulting in increased venous return of unopacified blood from the inferior vena cava (IVC). More unopacified blood from the IVC than opacified blood from the SVC enters the right atrium resulting in poor enhancement of the pulmonary arteries. This phenomanon is especially seen in younger patients, who are capable of deep inspiration. 1. Optimal 2. Too late. 3. Transient interruption of contrast The quality of CT depends on good contrast delivery and perfect timing. Scans for pulmonary emboli are frequently of poor quality in young patients and of good quality in old patients. The explanation is the following: The images demonstrate: Enable Scroll

Cystic Abdominal Masses in Children:
Erik Beek
Radiology department of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2017-11-01 Cystic masses in the abdomen of a child are common. Many of these are discovered with prenatal ultrasound. Others are detected when a child has abdominal complaints and imaging is performed. The cyst is either the cause of the complaints or an incidental finding. In this pictorial essay we will show the most common abdominal cystic masses in children. Ultrasound is often all that is needed for a diagnosis and will help the pediatrician or pediatric surgeon to make a treatment plan. In difficult cases MRI and sometimes CT can be useful.
Systematic Approach:

Differentiate cystic from solid:
Origin of lesion Claw sign This refers to the acute angles between lesion and parenchyma that indicates that this lesion has arisen from the parenchyma. Check organsCheck liver, spleen, ductus choledochus, ovaries and pancreas. Normal ovaries excludes ovarian cysts. Specific features Small cyst in the wall of a lesion suggests ovarian origin. Multilayered wall suggests origin from the digestive tract, e.g. duplication cyst or Meckels diverticulum
Differential diagnosis:
The most common cystic lesions in the pediatric abdomen are listed in the table. Rare cysts that we will not discuss are: Large cystsIn large cysts it is often difficult to locate the origin. A "claw sign", an organ draped over a cyst, can help to pinpoint its origin. Look for the abdominal organs and try to establish if they are normal. In doing so, you can easily exclude cysts of the liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas and choledochal duct. Neonatal girlsIn neonatal girls you are very likely dealing with an ovarian cyst. Ovaries in young girls are very mobile and an ovary with a cyst can even be located at the liver hilum, so do not rely on its typical pelvic location. Look at the wall of the cyst, search for small follicle cysts. Only the depiction of two normal ovaries excludes an ovarian cyst, unless the cyst is clearly arising from some other organ. BoysIn boys, large cystic lesions of undetermined origin are probably lymphangiomas. These can be so large that they can be confused with ascites. Look for sharp edged fluid in locations as Morrisons pouch or anterior to the liver to diagnose the fluid collection as ascites. The content of a lymphangioma is often cloudy and looks like a "snow storm" when the cyst is compressed, while in ascites the content usually remains clear.
Ovarian cysts:
Newborns and infantsWith the introduction of prenatal ultrasound, ovarian cysts are often detected antenatally. Ovarian cysts are divided in small (<4cm) or large cysts (>4 cm), and into simple, anechoic, thin-walled cysts or complicated cysts. Complicated cysts are thick-walled, and can have debris and septa. Most thick-walled cysts are twisted ovaries. Some reports state that these will regress, but most are resected. Postpubertal The majority of ovarian cysts in postpuberal girls are functional cysts. There are no strict guidelines for the management of ovarian cysts in infants. Generally cysts >4 cm and complicated cysts are operated. Cysts 2.5 - 4 cm are followed-up with US. Cysts < 2,5 cm generally regress spontaneously over time and follow-up is not necessary.
Ovarian torsion:
Suggestive features for ovarian torsion are: Here an antenatally detected cyst, confirmed after birth in a newborn girl. A cyst with a fluid-fluid level is seen. At operation a torsion of the left ovary was found.
Follicular cyst:
The majority of ovarian cysts in postpuberal girls are functional cysts. Normally several oocytes mature into follicles in a menstrual cycle. One of these becomes the dominant follicle, which ruptures and releases the oocyte. After release of the oocyte, the dominant follicle collapses, and the granulosa cells in the inner lining proliferate and swell to form the corpus luteum of menstruation. Over the course of 14 days the corpus luteum degenerates, leaving the small scarred corpus albicans.
Read more... So if one is thinking of a possible ovarian tumor process, do a follow-up ultrasound 2 weeks after the last menstruation day. The lesion should be involuted in case of a corpus luteum cyst
Corpus luteum cyst:
A corpus luteum may seal and fill with fluid or blood, forming a corpus luteum cyst. The transvaginal ultrasound images show a small complex ovarian cyst with wall vascularity on power Doppler analysis. The characteristic circular Doppler appearance is called the 'ring of fire'. Note, there is good through-transmission and no internal vascularity, consistent with a, partially involuted, corpus luteum cyst. Follow-up after one month demonstrated resorption of the mass and a normal left ovary.
Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst:
When a Graafian follicle or follicular cyst bleeds, a complex hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (HOC) is formed. On ultrasound an hemorrhagic ovarian cyst presents as an unilocular thin-walled cyst with fibrin-strands or low-level echoes and good through transmission. On MRI hemorrhagic cysts are bright on pre-contrast T1-FatSat, and dark on T2. There should be no internal vascularity on Doppler ultrasound or post-contrast internal enhancement on CT or MRI. Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts have variable wall thickness, and often some circumferential vascularity can be seen. Clinically the classic presentation is with acute pain. However HOC can also be an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient.
Ovarian teratoma:
Ovarian teratomas are composed of ecto-, meso-, and endoderm. They can become apparent as a large painless mass, but they can also twist, especially when the diameter is > 5 cm and cause an acute abdomen. Some are incidental findings. On US a cystic mass can be seen with calcifications. Sometimes a fluid-fluid level is seen, by the separation of watery fluids and fat. If the tumor contains lots of bone, hair, or calcifications, it is echogenic and sonographic diagnosis is challenging. A Rokitansky nodule refers to a solid mass attached to the wall of a cyst, containing hair, bone, teeth or fat. A plain abdominal film can sometimes show teeth or bone. CT and especially MRI can provide a clear answer to the nature of the lesion. On MRI some solid parts display high signal on T1, with low signal on fat suppressed sequences due to the fat content in the tumor. Most of the solid parts enhance after Gadolineum. Pathology demonstrated a immature teratoma. The US- image shows a cystic lesion in the lower abdomen in a 3-year-old girl with colicky abdominal pain. At operation a torsion of the right adnex was seen. On pathology a teratoma was demonstrated. Malignant teratoma
Ovarian malignancy:
Ovarian malignancies are rare. The chance of malignancy is greater in younger girls (1-8 y) than in girls (15-19 y). Here a CT-image of a 13-year-old girl presented with a lower abdominal mass. It is a partly cystic, partly solid tumor with some calcifications. The solid parts are inhomogeneous. The tumor was resected and pathology showed a teratoma with malignant parts, with lymph node metastasis. A mirror artefact of the bladder can mimick a cystic ovariumtumor. When in doubt a repeat examination after emptying of the bladder will solve this problem.
Intestinal duplication cyst:
Intestinal duplication cysts are duplications of the bowel. The majority do not communicate with the bowel. They can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. The majority is in the jejunum and ileum. Most are on the mesenteric side and, if resected, a bowel resection is necessary. Intestinal duplication cysts present with bleeding, intussusception, obstruction, abdominal pain. They can be found at prenatal ultrasound. In typical cases a multilayered lining is seen, identical to a bowel wall and peristalsis may be visible. If the cyst was infected the layers can be sloughed off. Ultrasound is usually sufficient to make the diagnosis. Here an antenatally detected cyst in a girl. Ultrasound showed a multilayered cyst and two normal ovaries. At operation a duplication of the ileum was resected. A six-month-old girl presented with vomiting. Ultrasound demonstrated a multilayered cystic structure at the inner side of the duodenum. The cyst was partially resected, the common wall with the duodenum was left in situ. Pathologic examination showed a duplication cyst. Here an unusual appearance of a duplication cyst. Ultrasound demonstrated an echogenic lesion in the left upper abdomen without a clear relationship to neighboring organs. At operation a tumor of the mesentery was resected. On macroscopic examination a tumor filled with a putty-like substance was seen. On microscopic examination a duplication cyst of the jejunum was found.
Lymphangioma:
Large lymphangiomas can resemble ascites. Look for fluid anterior to the liver or in Morrisons pouch to exlude a lymphangioma. An abdominal lymphangioma consists of dilated lymphatic channels, comparable to the cystic lesions in the neck. Sometimes the term omental cyst or mesenteric cyst is used. On ultrasound cystic masses are seen, which can be clear or cloudy, unilocular or septated and small to very large. In very large lesions with only a few septa the differentiation from ascites is difficult. Lymphangiomas do not creep into small spaces like ascites does, but they can be very soft with a plicated wall. CT will demonstrate masses with water density. Septa are less well seen than on ultrasound. After hemorrhage they can even appear solid. The MRI characteristics depend on the absence or presence of bleeding or infection. Uncomplicated cysts are low on T1 and high on T2, but these signals are variable after bleeding. A one-year-old boy presented with a swollen abdomen. A huge cystic lesion was seen with ultrasound, extending from the liver into the pelvis. Some debris was visible. A T2-weigthed coronal MR better shows the extension of the lesion. At operation it was attached to the ascending colon, which was resected together with the lymphangioma. Here a two-year-old boy with bilious vomiting. Ultrasound showed a large thin-walled multicystic tumor, which appeared rather weak. At operation a lymphangioma of the mesentery was resected.
Renal cystic masses:

Renal cysts:
Contrary to adults, simple renal cysts are rare in children. Especially in young children think of a syndrome if you see renal cysts. Cysts occur in tuberous sclerosis, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, among others. In children on dialysis the native kidneys will demonstrate cystic changes. Autosomal dominant polycystic disease and autosomal recessive infantile polycystic disease are outside the scope of this article. A very tortuous, debris filled ureter with peristalsis can be confused with bowel loops.
Hydronephrosis:
A simple hydronephrosis of the kidney is easy to recognize. It can be due to a ureteropelvic junction stenosis, ureteric stenosis or vesicoureteral reflux If the hydronephrosis is huge it can be difficult to recognize as such, especially if debris is present. It can mimic a dilated bowel loop, especially if it is accompanied by a tortuous dilated ureter full of debris with peristalsis. A high frequency probe can show a thin layer of renal tissue surrounding the cystic structure. Even a hugely dilated pelvicocalyceal system can turn out to be part of a well-functioning kidney. Radionuclear examination or MRU, after nephrostomy, can provide information on the remaining renal function. Here an ultrasound image of a five-month-old boy with an antenatally detected dilated pyelocalyceal system and no visible ureter, in accordance with a ureteropelvic junction stenosis. On a sagittal image the dilated pyelocalyceal system is well seen. One-year-old boy was referred with a diagnosis of a cystic nephroblastoma. Ultrasound detected a huge cyst in the middle of the abdomen. When examined from the left flank with a high frequency linear array probe some parenchymal tissue was visible surrounding very dilated calyces. This is compatible with an extreme hydronephrosis. At first it was thought that there were some solid parts in the cyst. But when pressure was applied with the probe this proved to be debris. MRI depicts the hydronephrosis with more overview. The cause was a pyeloureteric stenosis. The left kidney had 33% split renal function on renography. A pyelum reconstruction was successfully performed.
Multicystic kidney disease:
A kidney, which is mainly composed of cysts of different sizes, is most likely a multicystic dysplastic kidney. In multicystic dysplastic kidney there is no normal parenchyma and no ureter. In approximately 25% of children with MCKD the contralateral kidney is affected by anomalies like reflux, ureteropelvic junction stenosis and positional abnormalities. The majority of MCKD will regress in size over time. Patients are followed with ultrasound to monitor the growth or involution of the MCKD and possible anomalies of the contralateral kidney. The image is of a one-month-old boy with a MCKD on prenatal ultrasound. Some tissue and several large cysts are seen. On Tc-99-DMSA scintigraphy no uptake was seen on the left side. This is compatible with a MCKD. Antenatally a duplex system of the left kidney was diagnosed with hydronephrosis. A postnatal ultrasound demonstrates a large cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney and some smaller cysts (not shown). No normal parenchyma was visible. On MCUG reflux in the lower pole system is seen, which is displaced caudally and rotated due to the upper pole mass. This is probably a MCKD confined to the upper pole. MCKD can affect one pole of a duplicated pelvicocalyceal system.
Cystic nephroma:
Cystic nephroma consist of multiple cysts and septa and occur predominantly in young boys and older women. These children present with an abdominal mass, or the tumor is found as an incidental finding during imaging. A cystic nephroma can also be merely composed of cysts and look like a lymphangioma. Especially in large tumors it can be difficult to visualize the remnants of the kidney from which the tumor stems. A seven-year-old boy was examined after passing a kidney stone. During ultrasound a multicystic tumor was detected. An excision biopsy failed to remove the lesion. During five years follow-up it was stable. On MRI the lesion has a fuzzy demarcation and has water signal intensity on all pulse sequences. The appearance is consistent with a cystic nephroma.
Nephroblastoma:
here an one and a half year old girl with a palpable tumor in the left abdomen. Ultrasound showed a large tumor composed of innumerable cysts, originating from the left kidney. On a T2 weighted coronal image the cysts are well displayed. The remainder of the left kidney is at the caudal side of the tumor. On pathology a cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma was diagnosed.
Abdominal abscess:
Abdominal abscesses can be seen after inflammation of abdominal organs, often appendicitis, and postoperatively. They are often of mixed echogenicity but can be largely cystic. The imaging strategy in children relies more on ultrasound then in adults, and during drainage procedures general anesthesia is often needed.
Meckels diverticulum:
An inflamed Meckels diverticulum is easily mistaken for an intussusception or appendicitis. A Meckels diverticulum is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, situated in the distal ileum. It can contain heterotopic remnants of gastric or pancreatic tissue. It is often asymptomatic and detected incidentally during operation. Symptoms do occur, mostly in children below the age of two. It can present with intestinal bleeding, intussusception, or volvulus with obstruction. It can even mimic appendicitis. Diagnosis can be made with technetium 99-m pertechnetate scintigraphy, depicting the ectopic gastric mucosa. An inflamed Meckels diverticulum can be detected on ultrasound, but is easily misdiagnosed as an intussusception or appendiceal mass because it presents with a thickened bowel wall. Nine-year-old boy with rectal bleeding. At ultrasound a cystic structure was seen between the umbilicus and the bladder, with a multilayered wall. This was diagnosed as eiither a Meckels diverticlum or a duplication cyst. At operation a Meckels diverticlum was resected. Nine-year-old boy with abdominal pain. US and CT show a cystic structure with surrounding inflammation above the bladder. US demonstrated a multilayered wall. The preoperative diagnosis was a Meckels diverticulum or duplication cyst. At operation a Meckels diverticulum was resected. Six-year-old girl presenting with acute intestinal obstruction. Clinically an intussusception was suspected. Ultrasound showed a cystic lesion with a whirlpool sign, either a duplication cyst or a Meckels diverticulum. At operation a Meckels diverticulum with adhesions and a volvulus was found.
Extrapulmonary sequestration:
Extralobar pulmonary sequestrations can occur in the retroperitoneum, mostly on the left in a suprarenal position. They are usually detected on prenatal ultrasound as an echogenic mass. Cystic parts are commonly present. This lesion should be in the differential diagnosis of an adrenal hemorrhage or neuroblastoma. Antenatally detected "shrunken third kidney". Postnatally a partly cystic, partly solid mass was seen in the left upper abdomen, separate from the spleen, kidney and adrenal gland. A presumptive diagnosis of a retroperitoneal sequestration was made. This was confirmed on pathology.
Choledochal cyst:
The therapy of choledochal cyst is resection, because it is a precancerous disease. Choledochal cyst is a rare anomaly. It classically presents with jaundice, a right upper abdominal mass, and abdominal pain. This triad is present in less than half of the patients. A long common channel of the choledochal and pancreatic duct is thought to predispose to a choledochal cyst. Pancreatic juices are believed to reflux into the choledochal duct, causing an erosion of its wall. The Todani classification is often used. (see diagram) Type 1 is the most common, followed by type 4. Ultrasound can demonstrate these lesions. MRCP can support the diagnosis. Choledochal cyst can be complicated by stone formation. If the stone is impacted it can cause bile duct dilatation and give the erroneous impression that type 4 is present instead of type 1. Therapy is resection, because it is a precancerous disease. Antenatally dectected cyst of the choledochal duct, confirmed on postnatal ultrasound as a Todani type 1 cyst. This was resected a few days after birth with a choledochojejunostomy and a Roux en Y loop
Hydrometrocolpos:
If a vaginal septum persists the proximal vagina (colpos) and / or uterus (metros) can be dilated with fluid or blood, causing a hydrometrocolpos. It occurs in two age groups: in neonatal girls in who it is often detected prenatally, and in pubertal girls in whom menstrual blood accumulates in the vagina. It is caused by an imperforated hymen, or by a vaginal atresia of transverse vaginal septum. It can be associated with renal agenesis. The kidneys should always be imaged in girls with genital anomalies. Ultrasound can provide the right diagnosis. Anomalies of the uterus are better seen with MRI. The differential diagnosis includes: Douglas abscess, rectal duplication, ovarian teratoma. The video shows a large cloudy cyst in the lower abdomen, with a small uterus on top in a neonatal girl, consistent with a hydrocolpos.
Adrenal hemorrhage:
In a patient with left adrenal hemorrhage the patency of the left renal vein should be determined. Adrenal hemorrhage mostly occurs at birth. It presents at first as an echogenic mass, which slowly liquefies in the course of several weeks. Pediatricians can become restless if the liquefaction is late to occur, for fear of missing a neuroblastoma. Absence of flow and of calcifications favors a hemorrhage. Also decrease in size over time speaks for a hemorrhage. If an adrenal hemorrhage has occurred antenatally the baby can be born with a cystic lesion, which can incidentally be detected. Sometimes a part of the adrenal gland is still visible with its characteristic multilayered texture. It can be confused with an obstructed upper pole moiety of a duplex kidney. A left sided adrenal hemorrhage is associated with left renal vein thrombosis. The left adrenal vein connects to the left renal vein, contrary to the right adrenal vein, which connects to the inferior caval vein. Like all hemorrhages an adrenal hemorrhage can be infected with formation of an abscess. Two-day-old boy with delayed passage of meconium. On US an incidental finding of an cystic transformed adrenal hemorrhage, probably antenatally. Two months later the lesion is resolving. A newborn boy presented with hematuria. Ultrasound showed a left renal vein thrombosis with a swollen kidney and absent venous flow. The left adrenal gland is enlarged and partly cystic, representing a left adrenal hemorrhage. One-month-old girl with fever and an adrenal haemorrhage on the left. Infection of the haemorrhage was suspected. Aspiration yielded pus and a percutaneous drain was placed. The lesion resolved slowly.
Splenic cyst:
Splenic cysts can be congenital or acquired, mostly posttraumatic. Congenital cysts are also named epithelial or epidermoid cysts. Thick wall cyst can be considered as acquired, after trauma or after infection. They can be anechoic or contain debris. In smaller cysts the diagnosis is straightforward. In large cysts it can be difficult to determine the organ of origin. Multiple cysts can be seen in lymphangiomatosis. A 16-year-old girl underwent imaging for an ovarian tumor. As an incidental finding a splenic cyst with a lot of debris was seen. It is stable over the last four years.
Hematoma:
Duodenal hematoma can cause complete obstruction of the duodenum. Hematomas in the abdomen are generally echogenic at first presentation but in the resorption phase are often hypoechoic or anechoic and can present as a cystic mass. An adequate history will lead to the correct diagnosis.
Duodenal hematoma:
A seven-year-old boy started vomiting a few hours after a duodenoscopy with biopsy. Ultrasound demonstrated a echogenic mass in the third part of the duodenum compatible with a hematoma. After 6 weeks an anechoic lesion with some septa is seen Fifteen-year-old girl with anorexia nervosa and signs and symptoms of a mild pancreatitis. Ultrasound demonstrated an echogenic cystic lesion below the pancreas against the duodenal wall. It looked like a hematoma. At further history taking it turned out that the patient inflicted self-injury.
Teratoma:
Do not mistake a mirror artefact of the bladder for a cystic teratoma!!
Sacrococcygeal teratoma:
A sacrococcygeal teratoma is composed of solid tissue, cysts and calcifications. They are often detected at prenatal ultrasound and can be huge. There is a classification: Class 4 tumours can escape detection at birth and present later with constipation. The alpha-fetoprotein level will be elevated. Diagnosis is generally made on physical examination and will be confirmed on ultrasound. An MRI is often made to document the exact extension of the tumor, especially to depict intraspinal extension, although ultrasound can demonstrate this as well in newborns and infants. Two-year-old girl with a sacral mass. On ultrasound a cystic lesion anterior to the sacrum is seen, compatible with a class 4 sacrococcygeal teratoma. It was completely resected. The intraspinal extension was visible on ultrasound, but MRI provides a better overview and a document for future comparison. A parasagittal MRI shows a presacral cystic mass. Newborn girl with a sacrococcygeal teratoma with external and internal solid and cystic parts, and a large intraspinal extension.
Teratoma of the gastric wall:
Teratomas can be present in other locations than the ovary or the sacrococcyx. They will consist of cystic, solid and/or calcified parts. Their sonographic appearance is often confusing, as is their organ of origin. MRI is important here. For-month-old boy with a large mass in the abdomen. Ultrasound shows a mixture of solid and cystic parts. It was separate from the solid abdominal organs. MRI demonstrates the party cystic and partly solid mass. At operation a benign teratoma of the gastric wall was resected.
Pancreatic pseudocyst:
A pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid collection with a fibrous wall. It can occur after trauma to the pancreas or after pancreatitis, which is mostly seen after asparaginase therapy, especially used in leukemia treatment. In older girls cystic tumors of the pancreas can occur. The most common is a solid pseuopapillary tumor. Sixteen-year-old girl with a cystic lesion of the pancreatic tail. After excision pathologic examination showed a solid pseudopapillary tumor.
Urachal cyst:
The urachus is a connection between the primitive bladder and the umbilical cord. If it does not obliterate several remnants are possible. The urachus can stay open, allowing urine to escape through the umbilicus. The most common remnant is a diverticulum on top of the bladder. It is also possible that a part of the urachus persists as a cyst in the course of the urachus. Nine-year-old boy with right lower abdominal pain since 3 days. The boy was suspected to suffer from appendicitis but ultrasound showed a normal appendix and a inflames cyst above the bladder. After antibiotic treatment the lesion was excised. Pathologic examination showed a urothelium lined cyst, compatible with a urachal remnant.

Stress fractures:
Most common sites of stress fractures
From the Radiology Department of the Academical Medical Centre, Amsterdam and the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2007-05-23 One of the most common injuries in sports is the stress fracture. In this review we will discuss: Common locations of stress fractures. Stress fractures
Location:
A stress fracture is an overuse injury. Bone is constantly attempting to remodel and repair itself, especially when extraordinary stress is applied. When enough stress is placed on the bone, it causes an imbalance between osteoclastic and osteblastic activity and a stress fracture may appear. Muscle fatigue can also play a role in the occurrence of stress fractures. For every mile a runner runs, more than 110 tons of force must be absorbed by the legs. Bones are not made to withstand so much energy on their own and the muscles act as shock absorbers. As muscles become tired and stop absorbing, all forces are transferred to the bones. Stress fractures usually occur after a recent change in training regimen has
taken place. Especially professional or recreational athletes and militairy
recruits are subject to change in training intensity (increased), type of
training or training circumstances (new shoes, other training surface etc.)
and thus at increased risk of developing a stress fracture. However,
sedentary people may also develop stress fractures if suddenly an active
lifestyle is adopted. Insidious onset of pain and swelling over the affected region is the most important complaint, initially during the activity. With ongoing exposure, pain will last after the training, eventually causing the athlete to stop exercising. Finally pain is experienced at rest. Stress fractures are most common in the weight-bearing bones of the lower extremity, especially the lower leg and the foot (Figure). Typical stress fracture of the distal shaft of the second metatarsal not seen on initial radiograph (left). Callus formation is seen at 4 weeks follow up.
Radiography:
Radiographs have a sensitivity of 15-35% for detecting stress fractures on initial examinations, increasing to 30-70% at follow up due to more overt bone reaction. Therefore, radiologists should not be comforted by negative radiographs and should initiate further state of the art imaging. Radiographs are however mandatory in order to show
overt fractures and to rule out other diseases,
like infections or tumours. On the left a 42-year old female who walks long
distances and has been experiencing forefoot pain for a month. On the initial radiograph no fracture is seen. After 4 weeks, a follow up radiograph clearly marks callus formation at the site of the stress fracture. Stress fracture: Normal radiograph, while STIR image already shows a high signal intensity of the bone marrow On the left a 28-year old female with recent onset of pain over a region of the 2nd metatarsal bone. At presentation, the radiograph was negative for fracture of the second metatarsal bone. An MRI STIR (Short TI Inversion Recovery)sequence showed a high signal intensity of
bone marrow and the surrounding soft tissue,
indicating bone marrow edema as a result of a
stress fracture. Stress fractures radiographically show the following signs:
MRI:
MRI has surpassed bone scintigraphy as the imaging tool for stress fractures, showing equal sensitivity (100%) but a higher specificity (85%), probably by giving better anatomical detail and more precisely depicting the tissues involved. Radiograph, STIR and T1WI of grade 3 stress fracture of 3rd metatarsal. STIR (short tau inversion recovery), T1-weighted (T1WI) and T2-weighted images (T2WI) are used for characterization and grading. Grading is based on signs seen at MRI: On the left a 22-year old female, a professional athlete with a recent onset of forefoot pain, persisting after training. At presentation MRI showed a high signal on the STIR- and a
low signal on T1WI (i.e. grade 3 stress
fracture). Grade 4 stress fracture of the navicular bone. T1WI and CT (axial image and coronal reconstruction) On the left a 27-year old soccer player in the
highest league of amateur football. He suffered from midfoot pain with a recent increase in
complaints. T1WI shows a definite fracture line in the navicular bone, indicating a grade 4 stress fracture. Corresponding CT shows a fracture line and sclerosis on the axial images and coronal reconstructions.
Femoral neck fractures:
Stress fracture of the femoral neck located on the compression side. There are two types of stress fractures of the femoral neck: They have a high risk of complicated healing
due to tension exerted on the fracture
elements.
These fractures are at risk for complete fracture and avascular necrosis. If conservative therapy fails, open reduction and internal fixation is recommended. On the left we see a compression fracture of the femoral neck. The radiograph is normal, but MR depicts the fracture and bone marrow edema (i.e.grade 4). Follow-up radiographs at 1, 3 and 13 months A radiograph made one month later shows evolvement to
complete fracture. Although this is a low-risk fracture, the follow-up radiographs at 3 and 13 months did show poor healing tendency.
Fractures of Tibia and Fibula:

Tibia:
The tibia is the most common location of stress fractures (more than 50%). On the left a 42-year old man with pain in his left knee. The pain had started gradually during a 10-mile running competition. The initial x-ray was reported as normal, but a T2-weigthed gradient echo of the knee shows bone marrow edema in the proximal tibia indicating the presence of a stress fracture. In retrospect, the sclerotic line on the x-ray also indicates the stress-fracture. X-ray and CT-scan showing a fissure at the insertion of the flexor digitorum longus muscle. Courtesy Dr Wuisman (3) On the left a 24-year old runner with pain in his lower leg since four months. Initially the pain was only present during running, but finally it was present even in rest. The x-ray was initially reported as normal. A bone-scan (not shown) showed a focal increase of activity. A CT-scan was performed for further differentiation and revealed a vertically oriented fissure at the insertion of the flexor digitorum longus muscle. The patient was treated with six weeks of rest,
followed by a gradual increase in training-activity. Stress fracture of the lower tibia. On the left a 50-year old male, who led a sendentary life. He participated in a 10-mile walking contest without any training beforehand. Gradually pain developed in the lower leg and in
the end he was unable to walk any further. The x-rays show a stress fracture of the lower tibia. Doing too much too soon is a common cause of stress fractures. Medial malleolar stress fracture: Initial coronal STIR image and CT at 11 months follow-up. On the left a 25-year old professional soccer player with complaints of the ankle. Evident marrow abnormalities on coronal STIR
sequence MRI was seen, but there was doubt about
the presence of a fracture line. At 11 months follow-up a clear fracture line is visualized by CT. Post operative radiograph On the left the postoperative radiograph with screws and lower leg cast at 12 months. It shows a just discernable fracture line at the
typical location: the junction of the tibial plafond
and inner vertical line of the medial malleolus Bilateral stress fracture of the distal fibula: Initial radiographs and Bone scintigraphy at 2 weeks follow up.
Fibula:
Fibular fractures account for 10% of stress fractures. Stress fractures of the fibula typically occur in the distal one-third. On the left an athlete with pain just above both
ankles, more pronounced on the left than on the right. Radiographs made at presentation were unremarkable. Bone scintigraphy 2 weeks later shows stress fractures of the distal fibula on both sides. The radiograph at 6 weeks follow-up (not shown) confirmed bilateral stress fractures with healing tendencies.
Fractures of the Foot:
Grade 3 stress fracture of the tarsal navicular bone.
Tarsal bones:
The navicular bone is the most common site for stress fractures of the tarsus. On the left a 16-year old male athlete with a high weekly mileage. He complained of a recent onset of midfoot pain during training,
lasting for several hours afterwards. There is high signal intensity in the navicular bone on the sagittal STIR-image. On the axial T1WI there is low signal intensity, but no definite fracture line. Stress fracture of 4th metatarsal: Radiograph at presentation and at 3 weeks follow up.
Metatarsal bones:
The metatarsal bones are common sites for stress fracures (25% of stress fractures). On the left a 15-year old female with no history of trauma. Recent onset of lateral forefoot pain with walking. The radiograph taken at presentation is unremarkable. Follow-up at 3 weeks shows complete fracture of the distal shaft of the 4th metatarsal with overt periosteal reaction Stress fracture of 2th metatarsal: Radiograph at presentation and at 1 and 3 months follow up. On the left a 39-year old female with forefoot pain which began during a biking holiday.
The radiograph at presentation is normal. At 1 and 3 months follow-up, clear healing tendencies can be seen, indicating the presence of a stress fracture Stress fracture of sesamoid of great toe: sagittal STIR and axial CT.
Sesamoid bones:
Sesamoid bones are uncommon sites for stress fractures. On the left a 14-year old male soccer player with persistent plantar forefoot pain. Stress fracture of the medial sesamoid of the
great toe is indicated by a high signal intensity
on an MR sagittal STIR-sequence at
presentation. A CT performed at presentation shows sclerosis of the medial sesamoid and confirms the diagnosis of stress fracture.
High and low risk stress fractures:
Stress fractures can be divided into high and low risk stress fractures according to their likelihood of uncomplicated healing with conservative therapy.

Cervical Cancer - MR staging:
Stephanie Nougaret¹, Doenja Lambregts² and Annemarie Bruining²
¹ Dept. of Radiology, Montpellier Cancer Centre, France and ² the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam:
Publicationdate 5-10-2023 In
this article we describe the role of MRI for the local staging of cervical
cancer. In
addition to clinical and pathological examination, MRI has an important role in
identifying patients with advanced disease and thereby to guide treatment
planning. 
It also aids in selecting patients eligible for fertility-preserving
strategies. 
MRI is also important to monitor treatment response and to detect
recurrent disease during post-treatment follow up. We will discuss: Overview
of current FIGO staging Introduction
Introduction:
Cervical cancer represents the fifth most common cancer type
in women and - together with endometrium cancer - accounts for 0,7% of all
cancer related deaths in the world (1,2).
Persistent human papilloma virus infection is the key risk
factor responsible for nearly all cervical cancers. 
HIV infection is a second
known risk factor, which increases the risk for cervical cancer by
approximately six-fold. 
Most common types of cervical cancer are squamous cell
carcinoma followed by adenocarcinoma and some rare other types such as
neuroendocrine tumors. Cervical cancer can be effectively prevented by vaccination
against HPV. Secondary prevention includes HPV DNA testing to screen for
active infection and prompt treatment of cervical pre-cancer. 
The primary
treatment for advanced cervical cancer (stage ≥ IB) is chemoradiotherapy (CRT)
followed by brachytherapy. 
In the vast majority of cases, this results in a complete
local tumor response and no further surgical intervention is needed. 
In the
minority of cases with persistent tumor after completion of CRT, addition surgical
resection is required. Early cases are treated with conservative surgery. The key risk factors in cervical cancer to assess on imaging are
tumor size, invasion into parametrium, pelvic side wall, vagina, bladder or
rectum,  and lymph node involvement. Like the uterus, the cervix shows distinct layers on T2W MRI. The cervical mucosa has a high signal intensity. 
The normal cervical stroma
has a low signal with an intact outer border. 
The external cervical os is
the opening between the cervix and vagina.
The internal cervical os is the opening
between the cervix and the uterine cavity. The zonal MRI anatomy of the uterus and cervix varies with age.
During the reproductive age the different layers of the uterus and cervix are well recognizable and the muscular part of the uterine wall can be highly vascularized like in this 30-year-old woman (left image).
There is an IUD in the uterine cavity, which can be recognized as a hypointense linear structure. In postmenopausal women the zonal anatomy becomes less
visible and the cervical stroma, junctional zone and myometrium appear more
homogeneously hypointense on T2W-images, like in this 70-year-old woman (right
image). With age, the female reproductive organs gradually become
smaller with a more pronounced loss in volume for the uterus compared to the
cervix.
Staging Cervical Cancer:

MR reporting checklist:
The MRI report in cervical cancer should address the key risk
factors used to stage the patient as listed in the table in order to determine
the most appropriate treatment strategy. Additional factors to report, that are mainly used for
surgical treatment planning: This schematic overview shows how the key risk factors that should be assessed on MRI impact the clinical tumor stage and corresponding treatment planning.
Tumor type and size:
The tumor size should be measured in the longest possible
dimension, which is often best visualized in the sagittal and sometimes in the
coronal plane. Cervical tumors can show either an exophytic (typically in
younger women), diffuse infiltrative or endocervical (typically in older women
and/or adenocarcinomas) growth pattern. 
Note that in the right image where
there is an endocervical mass, this mass causes obstruction of the cervical
canal with widening of the uterine cavity which is filled with high signal
fluid  and intermediate signal blood resulting in a blood-fluid line.
Vaginal invasion:
Invasion of the vaginal wall can be recognized on T2-weighted
MRI as the extension of relatively hyperintense soft tissue extending into the
vaginal wall. In case of vaginal invasion you need to establish whether
this concerns the upper 2/3 (stage IIA) or lower 1/3 (stage III) of the vagina, as this impact patient management.
Stage IIA1/IIA2 may be eligible for upfront surgery.
In contrast lower vaginal involvement preclude surgery and patients are referred for chemoradiation.
Parametrial invasion:
When the hypointense stromal ring of the cervix is intact
(left image), MRI can predict the absence of parametrial invasion with a high
negative predictive value of more than 90%. Interruption of the hypointense stromal ring of the cervix (right
image) and tumoral signal intensity or soft tissue mass extending into the
parametrium are signs indicative of parametrial invasion (FIGO stage IIB). Pitfall
- Expansion versus invasion This example shows a large tumor that expands the cervix. Note that there is no actual invasion of the parametia as the
hypointense stromal ring of the cervix is completely intact as indicated by the
arrowheads.
Pelvic sidewall invasion:
Pelvic sidewall
invasion is defined as invasion or tumor abutment within < 3 mm of the
internal obturator, levator ani or piriformis muscles, or the iliac vessels,
either with or without obstruction of the ureter resulting in hydronephrosis (stage IIIB).
Sacrouterine ligament invasion:
This sagittal MRI shows a locally advanced cervical cancer (circle) with extensive invasion along
the sacrouterine ligaments (arrows).
Bladder and rectal invasion:
The case on the
left shows a cervical tumor with clear invasion of the dorsal bladder wall
extending into the bladder lumen. 
This represents stage IV disease. Pitfall
- Invasion versus bullous edema The image shows a cervical tumor invading the upper 1/3 of
the vagina. There is a hyperintense layered appearance of the bladder
wall (arrows) consistent with bullous edema. There is no intermediate T2-weighted signal intensity or
nodularity within the bladder,  suggesting that there is no actual tumor
invasion into the bladder.
Lymph node staging:
The regional lymph nodes in staging cervical cancer include all lymph nodes in the pelvis and para-aortic nodes up to the level of the renal veins.
It is important to detect para-aortic lymph node metastases, as presence of these nodes requires adaptation of the radiotherapy field. Inguinal lymph nodes and para-aortic nodes above the level of the renal veins are considered distant metastases. MRI has a
limited diagnostic performance for pelvic lymph node staging. 
It mainly
relies on nodal size as a criterion; size cut-offs vary in literature but a
commonly used threshold is 1 cm. 
Reported sensitivities (±40-90%) and
specificities (±80-100%) for MRI vary widely. 
PET/CT is more accurate than MRI
and is used for pelvic lymph node staging, as well as for the assessment of
para-aortic lymph nodes and distant lymph node metastases  above the level
of the renal veins (3). Images
There is a locally
advanced cervical cancer with right-sided parametrial and pelvic sidewall
involvement.
There is a 7 mm node dorsal to the right external iliac
vein (white arrow) which is indeterminate on MRI. 
Based on its size it is not
clearly pathologic.  
On corresponding
PET/CT the primary tumor is clearly FDG-avid, as is the small para-iliac lymph
node (black arrow), thereby diagnosing it as N+.
MR protocol:
The recommended MRI protocol is summarized in the table. Addional
recommendations are as follows: Patient
preparation: Note that contrast-enhanced images are not required for
cervical cancer staging. 
Scheduling the examination according to the menstrual
cycle is not required.
Sequence planning:
The MR sequences are planned relative to
the long axis of the cervical canal.
The axial plane is perpendicular to the long axis of the cervical canal. The coronal plane is parallel to the long axis of the cervical canal.
Pitfall: variations in cervical anatomy:
The
position of the cervical canal needs to be taken into account and the perpendicular and parallel MRI
sequences need to be planned accordingly. Example showing
how flexion, and in particular version impact sequence planning. 
In this case
there is anteversion of the cervix and retroflexion of the uterus.
Remember that in
cervical cancer, the axial sequences are planned perpendicular to the cervical
canal. Another
example showing the cervix in retroversion and the uterus in anteflexion. 
See how
this variation in position impacts corresponding sequence planning.
Fertility preservation:
Fertility preserving surgery (trachelectomy) can be offered
in selected patients with early stage cervical cancer, based on the criteria
shown in the Table. Example showing how to assess the distance to internal
cervical os The image shows an exophytic cervical tumor. The distance from the tumor to the internal os measured at
the stalk of the lesion is > 1cm. The patient was eligible to trachelectomy.
FIGO stage:
The International
Federation of Gynaecology and Obstretrics (FIGO) staging system that is most
commonly used to stage cervical cancer was traditionally designed as a clinical surgical staging system. 
However, current evidence and clinical guidelines
recommend to include imaging findings (in particular MRI) for staging and
treatment planning as it provides crucial information on tumor size and depth,
extent of invasion into surrounding organs and structures, and lymph node
status, which are essential in choosing the most appropriate treatment
strategy. 
An overview of the current 2023 FIGO stages for cervical cancer is
provided in this Table.We refer readers to the complete FIGO guidelines for more detailed
info (4).

MRI examination of the Elbow:
by Mark Anderson
University of Virginia Health Sciences Center:
Publicationdate 2013-10-05 This review is dased on a presentation given by Mark Anderson and adapted for the Radiology Assistant by Robin Smithuis. We will discuss: Common types of pathology. MRI technique
MRI technique:

Scan planes:
Just like in the shoulder you need to be sure to get the imaging planes correctly in a standardized way. Use the axis of the epicondyles on a axial localizer to plan the coronal scan. The sagittal images are scaned perpendicular to the coronal scan. In this way you get very persistent images and you will get used to the normal anatomy.
Imaging sequences:
T1In every joint that is studied you should have at least one T1-sequence not only to look at the anatomy, but also as a back up for looking at the marrow. Ofcourse the T2-fatsat images will show marrow abnormalities, but T1 can be helpful in telling us what is really going on. T1 is certainly used in MR-arthrography. T2-fatsatT2 will show us most of the pathology, whether it is in the bone marrow, ligaments or muscle because of the high water content. It can also be used to image cartilage. Gradient echoWith gradient echo we can use 3-D thin sections to image the cartilage and the ligaments. In the MR-protocol we do T1 and T2-fatsat in all three imaging planes. Sometimes STIR is used.
MR-arthrography:
Typically the radiocapitellar joint is punctured from lateral with the patient prone and the arm flexed 90 degrees overhead (red arrow). This however can sometimes cause problems if you are interested in the lateral ligaments and you inject lidocaine or contrast into these ligaments. So more recently we started to use the posterior approach into the olecranon fossa (blue arrow). Diluted gadolinium is injected, i.e. 0,05cc + 10cc saline (an "off-label" use in the US). Indications for MR-arthrography are:
Anatomy and Pitfalls:
When you study the anatomy of the elbow, it is good to use the inside-out approach. First study the bones and then continue with the ligaments and the tendons and then the surrounding structures.
Tendon attachments:
Common flexor tendon Attaches at the medial epicondyle Ulnar collateral ligament or UCL Starts at the undersurface of the medial epicondyle and runs down to the sublime tubercle, which is the medial side of the coronoid process. Common extensor tendon Originates at the lateral epicondyle. Lateral collateral ligament Originates just underneath the attachment of the common extensor tendon. Lateral ulnar collateral ligament This is a somewhat confusing term for a tendon that also originates just underneath the common extensor tendon. It swings down behind the radial head and attaches at the area of the ulna that is called the supinator crest - see lateral view. Biceps tendon Attaches on the radial tuberosity. Brachialis tendon Attaches on the coronoid process. Annular ligament Attaches on the volar side of the sigmoid notch of the ulna and runs around the radial head and attaches on the dorsal side of the sigmoid notch.
Pseudodefect of the capitellum:
This is a finding that you frequently see on coronal images. It looks like an osteochondral lesion, but if you look at the sagittal image you will notice that the coronal image runs through the posterior non-articular portion of the capitellum. So when the elbow is fully extended, a portion of the radial head is actually behind the carticular surface of the capitellum. On a coronal view we will be looking at the radial head which is covered with cartilage and opposite to it the non-cartilage covered part of the capitellum, which frequently is somewhat irregular.
Pseudo-loose body:
Another common finding is a small piece of fat that you'll see on the sagittal image, that looks like a small loose body or a cartilage defect. This can be explained if we look at the articular surface of the olecranon. Typically the olecranon has two pieces of cartilage with a small area inbetween, that fills with fat.
Plica:
This structure on the lateral side of the joint is sometimes seen and is a plica. It can be prominent and almost look like a meniscus. It is a normal structure, but sometimes it is thickened or irregular and it may be a cause of symptoms.
Elbow Mechanics:
The elbow serves as a hinge joint when we look at the humeroulnar and radiocapitellar joint. The other joint is the proximal radioulnar joint with rotation allowing pronation and supination. Many acute and chronic injuries occur as a result of throwing. During the throwing motion in the phase of late cocking to acceleration, there are tremendous valgus forces that are pulling the elbow. The valgus overload results in enormous tension on the medial side trying to pull things apart (yellow arrows), while the lateral side will be under compression (blue arrows). On the posterior side it causes shear forces along the head of the olecranon (black arrow).
Valgus overload syndrome:
All these forces make up what is called the "valgus overload syndrome" with very characteristic injuries to the elbow over time. Arthrosis in valgus overload syndrome Due to the valgus overload there are shear forces on the posteromedial part of the humeroulnar joint. Notice the subchondral sclerosis seen on the T1W-image (red arrow). On the T2W-image there is subchondral bone marrow edema and cartilage loss (yellow arrow). Enable Scroll

On the coronal images there is a beautiful anterior bundle of the UCL, but notice that there is osteophyte formation on the medial part of the joint (red arrow). As we go further posteriorly there is a small area of low signal intensity (yellow arrow), which is an avulsion of part of the UCL. This is better appreciated on the radiograph. Continue with the axial scan. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll As we look on the axial scan, we can appreciate the huge osteophyte formation. Notice that the ulnar nerve (blue arrow) is next to these osteophytes and these patients may present with ulnar neuropathy.
Posterolateral Rotatory instability:
There are different stages of instability of the elbow joint and the final stage is dislocation. In stage 1 there is subluxation of the ulna and there is tearing of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament. In stage 2 there is more injury, where the coronoid perches the trochlea and there is more ligamentous injury. In stage 3 finally the coronoid ends up behind the humerus in a true dislocation and you may tear the ulnar collateral ligament, which results in a very unstable - floating - elbow.
Elbow dislocation:
Here a lateral view of the elbow of a patient who fell on the outstretched arm. The radiograph shows joint effusion (red arrows) and a coronoid fracture (yellow arrow). Continue with the MR-images. Now here is the MR. Study the images and then continue reading... Coronal view: Sagittal view: All these signs are the result of a posterior dislocation. Read more in the article of Zehava Rosenberg in AJR 2008 entitled: MRI Features of Posterior Capitellar Impaction Injuries These images are of a 23 year old male who fell onto his outstretched hand two weeks ago while skateboarding. On physical exam there was decreased range of motion of the elbow and tenderness along the lateral aspect. First study the images, then continue reading... What is the structure on the axial image behind the radial head? Sagittal view: The structure behind the radial head is the annular ligament. It is irregular and thickened as a result of the posterior dislocation.
Osteochondral lesions:

OC lesion of capitellum:
Osteochondral lesion is the new name for osteochondritis dissecans or OCD. The chronic valgus overload can cause an osteochondral lesion on the lateral side of the elbow. It is the result of repetitive impaction and shear forces. The radiograph is of a 15 year old baseball player with 4 year history of elbow pain and a recent episode of locking. There is a focal lucency in the capitellum and some fragmntation. This is typical for a osteochondral lesion of the capitellum and the locking is probably the result of loose bodies. Continue with the MR... The MR-arthrogram confirms the osteochondral lesion. There is gadolinium in between the humerus and the osteochondral lesion which indicates that it is unstable. If you don't have gadolinium, look for joint fluid undercutting the fragment. There is a loose body in the posterior recess of the radiocapittelar joint. Notice also the fragmentation as seen on the axial image. The osteochondral lesion of the capitellum is typically seen in throwers and gymnasts (11-15 yrs), who get a lot of wrist and elbow problems due to weight bearing. Here another case in a 20 year old gymnast. Again there is lucency on the radiograph. The MR-arthrogram shows some bone marrow edema on the coronal view. The sagittal T1W-image shows subchondral bone abnormality, but not much of a fragment. There is some cartilage thinning, but not a defect. This is obviously a stable fragment and there were no loose bodies. These images are of a young baseball player, who presented with elbow pain at age 14. The T2W-fatsat image shows marrow edema and maybe there is a subchondral fracture. Obviously someone told him to keep throwing, because he came back three years later at age 17 and you can see what can happen when they push too hard in getting these kids to become a professional. The T1W-image shows fragmentation (yellow arrow) with a loose body (red arrow). The T2W-image demonstrates that the fragment is unstable because there is high signal between the fragment and the humerus. At arthroscopy there is depression and irregularity of the cartilage of the capitellum. First the loose bodies were taken out. Then frequently an OATS-procedure is performed, which we will discuss now.
OATS procedure:
OATS stands for osteochondral autologous transfer. Pieces of cartilage and bone are taken out of some other non-weight bearing bone and tranferrred to the capitellum. In this patient the cartilage is taken from the non-weight bearing part of the knee. Then holes are drilled in the capitellum and the defects are filled with the autologous bone and cartilage. Here the hole in the capitellum is filled with four pieces of bone and cartilage. The radial head is seen opposite the capitellum.
OC lesion of trochlea:
These images are of a patient with anterior elbow pain. There was no recent injury. The clinical diagnosis was a biceps tendinitis or a bicipital bursitis. The findings on the coronal MR-images are quite uncommon. If you would see this in the capitellum you would call it an osteochondral lesion of the capitellum. So this is called an osteochondral lesion of the trochlea. Notice the small cystic changes (white arrow). There is also a small cartilage defect. An osteochondral lesion of the trochlea is usually seen in younger patients, who have an immature skeleton. It is seen in the lateral trochlea like in this case due to repetitive hyperextension in an area with tenuous blood supply. It is also seen in the medial trochlea due to laxity and posteromedial abutment. Here a different patient. Notice that it is a young patient, because the physis is still open. There is a large osteochondral lesion in the lateral trochlea (yellow arrows). Notice the edema in the subchondral bone (red arrow). The cartilage is still intact.
Ulnar Collateral Ligament:
The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is situated on the medial side and it has three components. The anterior bundle is the strongest component and is the primary restraint against valgus forces. On MR this is the most important structure. The posterior bundle attaches distally in a fan-shape on the olecranon. It forms the floor of the cubital tunnel. The transverse bundle runs from the olecranon to the olecranon, so it doesn't do much. The UCL (in yellow) originates on the undersurface of the medial epicondyle just beneath the origin of the common flexor tendon. It attaches on a small process on the medial side of the coronoid, which is called the sublime tubercle. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Always use the axial images when you study the ligaments, especially the UCL. Scroll through the images. text Here we see two consecutive coronal images of the UCL. It is normal to see some high signal in the proximal part (arrow). Notice how it firmly attaches to the sublime tubercle and compare this to the next images. text
UCL tear:
Remember that the UCL should attach very tightly on the sublime tubercle. In this case it doesn't, so even on these two images you can tell that there is a complete tear. Notice that there is some marrow edema in the sublime tubercle. The mechanism of injury to the UCL is usually chronic tensile forces, which create microtears. This is seen in pitchers and other overhead throwing-athletes. A tear can also occur in a fall on the outstretched hand. Most commonly there is a complete tear, but sometimes there is a partial tear which can be very hard to see. That is why in these athletes MR-arthrogram is usually performed. Study the images and then continue reading... This is a 18 year old baseball pitcher with medial elbow pain. A partial tear is seen creating a 'T-sign'. First study the coronal T2-fatsat images and then continue reading... Notice that the anterior bundle is intact and firmly attaches to the sublime tubercle (yellow arrow). On the next two images there is some soft tissue edema and more abnormal signal posteriorly (red arrow). So we suspect pathology of the posterior bundle. Now you remember that the axial images can be helpful. So continue with the axial image. On the axial image we nicely see the anterior bundle is o.k. (red arrow). There is only some edema next to it. However the posterior bundle is not o.k. This is partial tearing. We see this occasionally in throwing athletes, where the anterior bundle is intact and their elbow is not unstable. They somehow have torn their posterior bundle, which causes pain. They do not need surgery, but it still may keep them out of the game for quite a while. Now here is the last case. This is a 38 year old male who has been weight-lifting for 20 years. He complains of intermittent elbow pain and popping. Notice that the UCL is abnormal with some areas of very high signal indicating a partial tear. On the lateral side there is subchondral edema and cartilage loss. This is arthrosis secondary to chronic instability due to the chronic partial tearing.
UCL repair:
UCL repair is done by placing tunnels in the medial epicondyle. They run done to the sublime tubercle and a graft is placed in between them. This radiograph is of a 26 year old professional baseball player who had a UCL reconstruction. Notice the tunnels (arrow). This operation usually works very well. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll If you scroll through the MR-images you can see the tunnel in the medial epicondyle. Just like in an ACL-graft we can see the low signal of the graft going all the way down. On the coronal images despite the spiky artifacts it almost looks like a normal UCL. Here we see images of a patient after repair who did not do so well. There is fragmentation of the bone and disruption of the graft. On the CT-scan it is better appreciated that there is a fracture through the tunnel.
Lateral Collateral Ligament:
Here an illustration of the lateral collateral ligament complex. It consists of the radial collateral, the lateral ulnar collateral and the annular ligament. When you look for the radial collateral ligament, first try to identify the common extensor tendon, because right underneath it you will find the radial collateral ligament (yellow arrow). As you go more posteriorly you will see the LUCL - the lateral ulnar collateral ligament, which sweeps behind the radial head (white arrows). The annular ligament is usually difficult to differentiate from the RCL, but sometimes it can be identified on a sagittal MR-artrogram. Enable Scroll

Common Extensor Tendon:
The common extensor tendon originates at the lateral epicondyle. On a T1W-images the tendon should have a low signal intensity (yellow arrow).
Lateral Epicondylitis:
Lateral epicondylitis is also known as the tennis elbow, although in 95% of cases it is seen in non-tennis players. It is due of chronic stress to the common extensor tendon, which results in partial tearing and tendinosis. Typically, the extensor carpi radialis brevis is the component that is involved. In more severe cases there is tearing of the LCL, which gives a poor response to conservative treatment. Here a typical case. There is thickening and abnormal intrinsic signal on both T1- and T2W-images.
Common Flexor Tendon:
The common flexor tendon originates at the medial epicondyle. On a T1W-images the tendon should have a low signal intensity (red arrow).
Medial Epicondylitis:
This is the counterpart of the lateral epicondylitis and also known as the golfer's elbow. Here the common flexor tendon is involved. On the sagittal image it is clear that it is only partial tearing. However this can be quite painful. Here we have the coronal T1W- and T2W-images. There is partial tearing, but it is very extensive.
Little Leaguer's Elbow:
First study the images of a patient with pain on the medial side, then continue reading... The findings are very subtle. The medial epicondyle of the affected arm is somewhat more osteopenic. In these cases we usually ask for a comparison view, because it can be very subtle. The diagnosis is a Little leaguer's elbow which results from chronic stress injury. The lucency on the radiograph, which looks like a widened physis, is due to cartilage ingrowth in the metaphysis. Continue with the MR... On the MR the abnormality is very obvious. There is marrow edema in the medial epicondyle and also in the adjacent bone (yellow arrow). Little Leaguer's elbow is also known as medial apophysitis and some call it epiphysiolysis. By the way this could also be called a Salter-Harris type I fracture, if it was an acute traumatic event. Notice the normal ulnar collateral ligament (red arrow). In children the weak link in valgus stress is not the ulnar collateral ligament but the physis. Here another case. This patient is a little bit older. The left epicondyle is already fused, but on the right the physis is still a little bit open. Continue with the MR... On the MR there is marrow edema. Notice that there is also some edema where the ulnar collateral ligament attaches, so there is also some tearing of the UCL. Here some more views of a different patient.
Biceps tendon:
Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Scroll through the axial images of the biceps tendon from the musculotendinous junction to the attachment on the radial tuberositas. The pathology of the distal biceps tendon is much like pathology in the achilles tendon. There can be tendinosis, partial tear and complete tear with or without retraction. Here are the ultrasound images of a 73 year old male who experienced a sudden pain and a tearing sensation when lifting a box. There was pain with pronation and supination and tenderness anteriorly proximal to the elbow joint. No ecchymosis or palpable mass. On the sagittal image the tendon is thickened, but distally the tendon is lost. MRI examination was performed. Now look at the MR-images and try to figure out if the tendon is retracted and whether there is a partial or complete tear... Well on the sagittal image it looks as if the tendon is completely thorn, but continue with the next images.
Tear of distal biceps tendon:
There is a complete tear, because if we follow the tendon all the way to the radial tuberosity, we can see that the tendon does not attach there (green arrow). There is only fluid. The reason why the tendon is not retracted is because the broad bicipital aponeurosis - also known as lacertus fibrosus - is still intact (red arrow). The distal biceps tendon not only inserts to the radial tuberosity, but also via the lacertus fibrosus into the fascia of the flexor pronator mass on the medial side of the forearm. The distal tendon of the biceps is encircled on the upper left image. When the aponeurosis is also thorn, then the tendon retracts and you get an obvious swelling in the arm caused by the contracted biceps muscle. A distal biceps tendon tear is an uncommon injury. It is seen in about 5% of biceps injuries. It is the result of a sudden extension force to the arm when the elbow is flexed. A proximal biceps tendon tear is more common. Usually it is the long head of the biceps that is completely torn. Here another example. On the T1W-image there is some thickening and some intermediate signal. This could be tendinosis, but always look at the T2W-images to look for a tear. In this case there is a partial tear. Here another case. On the sagittal images we were not sure about a possible tear. Maybe there only was some tendinosis or tendinitis. The axial images demonstrate a high grade partial tear (red arrow). Always make sure that your axial scan goes all the way to the tuberosity, because is you stop too early, like in this case, then you will only see a thickened tendon and some fluid, but you are not sure about a possible tear. Here an easy case, because the tendon is retracted as can be best seen on the sagittal image. So the lacertus must also have been torn.
Radiobicipital bursitis:
Here are sagittal and axial images of a patient who was referred to an orthopedic oncology surgeon for a mass near the elbow. There is a partial tear (arrow) of the biceps tendon, but the question is, what is the structure that we are looking at and what is within it. The structure is the radiobicipital bursa, so this is a bursitis. Remember that the biceps tendon does not have a tendon sheaht, so tenosynovitis is not a possibility. The differential diagnosis for the low intensity structures within the bursa is: synovial chondromatosis, PVNS and rice bodies. It turned out to be rice bodies. In any synovial lined joint or bursa these rice bodies can be formed as a result of chronic inflammation with synovial hypertrophy. The villi will outgrow their blood supply, become necrotic and fall into the joint or bursa. They are called rice bodies because when you open up the joint, they just look like rice. Here another case. The white arrow in the left sided image is pointing to the bursa. Notice that the biceps is intact. Next to the radiobicipital bursa (yellow arrow), also an interosseous bursa (red arrow) was described by Abdalla Skaf in Radiology in the article entitled: Bicipitoradial Bursitis: MR Imaging Findings. Sometimes these masses mimic a tumor or they can cause impingement on the radial nerve when they become very large.
Brachialis tendon:
The brachialis originates from the lower half of the front of the humerus, near the insertion of the deltoid muscle. It lies deeper than the biceps brachii, and is a synergist that assists the biceps in flexing the elbow. The thick tendon inserts on the anterior surface of the coronoid process of the ulna. On a sagittal view, when you compare the brachialis tendon (yellow arrows) with the biceps tendon (red arrows), notice that the brachialis is almost all muscle. It only has a very short tendon distally.
Chronic avulsion:
This image is of a 68 year old woman who injured her arm approximately 10 years previously and now presents with increasing pain in that arm. First study the radiograph and then continue with the MR... First study these axial T1W-images and then continue reading... Radiograph The cortex of the ulna is irregular and in a 68 year old woman there was concern of underlying bone abnormality like for instance a bone tumor. MRI The biceps tendon is indicated by the red arrow and demonstrates tendinosis and partial tearing. However when we look at the insertion of the brachialis tendon on the coronoid process, there is tearing of the tendon with a lot of bone marrow edema as seen on the fat suppressed T2W-image. In fact this was a chronic type of avulsion injury with partial tearing of the tendon. The bone reaction can mimic an aggressive bone lesion. Here another chronic avulson, which was sent to the oncologic surgeon, because there was concern about a possible juxta-cortical osteosarcoma. The MR however revealed the following: Chronic avulsive injuries are common in adolescents, but may also be seen in older patients. The problem is that they may mimic infection or tumor.

Ulnar nerve:
Here we see the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel. The posterior band of the ulnar collateral band forms the floor of the tunnel, while the retinaculum forms the roof. First study the images. This patient had ulnar nerve neuropathy. What is the cause? Cubital tunnel syndrome is a common peripheral neuropathy. It arises from compression of the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel, where the nerve passes beneath the cubital tunnel retinaculum. Possible causes of cubital tunnel syndrome: Read more on neuropathy in the 2006 Radiographics article by Gustav Andreisek et al entitled: Peripheral neuropathies of the median, radial and ulnar nerves: MR imaging features. What is missing in this image and what is the probable cause... The ulnar nerve is not where it is supposed to be. Now the nerve could be dislocated, but in this case the nerve was surgically transposed. Ulnar nerve transposition is performed in patients in whom the ulnar nerve is compressed against the medial epicondyle. So the question is, when they take the ulnar nerve out of the tunnel, where do they put it. This can be subcutaneous, submuscular or intramuscular. Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll Enable Scroll
Disable Scroll So when we go back to the image, you will notice that it can be difficult to find the nerve. Any of these subcutaneous structures could be the transposed nerve. A way to do it, is to follow the structures distally until you find the ulnar nerve distally in its normal position in the proximal forearm surrounded by fat. Then when you follow it proximally, you will notice that this was a subcutaneous transposition. In this case, there is neuritis. There is enlargement of the nerve. On the T2W-image there is high signal. Another sign is non-uniform enlargement of the fascicles, which is seen on the sagittal image (arrow).
Radial nerve:
The radial nerve can be best identified at the level of the radial head, where you can see superficial and deep branches in the radial tunnel (arrows). This is a very consistent place to find the radial nerve. The deep radial branches form the posterior interosseus nerve which penetrates the supinator muscle at the arcade of Frohse (arrow). Study these images and then continue reading. What are the findings? The findings are: So the atrophy is a result of compression of the posterior interosseous nerve, which is a branch of the radial nerve.
Median nerve:
The median nerve goes down behind the Lacertus fibrosis, which is the aponeurosis of the biceps and penetrates the pronator muscle.
Denervation:
Nerve pathology can present as thickening of the nerve when there is neuritis or as a result of compression of the nerve. A secondary sign of nerve pathology is denervationwith edema and/or atrophy of the muscle. In this case there is chronic atrophy with high sinal on T1, which is irreversible. In early or subacute denervation the prominent sign is edema with high signal on T2W-images and that is reversible. This is a 48 year old male with Marfan's syndrome, who had a sudden onset of right hand weakness. This is a nice example of subacute denervation. Notice on the T1W-image that there is no atrophy. Only edema on the T2W-image. This was due to proximal radial neuropathy.
Soft Tissue Masses:
Around the elbow all kind of soft tissue masses can occur, which are also seen in other places. If you cannot make a specific diagnosis, just call the mass indeterminate an do a biopsy, because in many cases you cannot tell the diagnosis. The image shows an oval lesion, which just looks like a schwannoma, because it is elongated and it looks as if it follows the nerve, but it turned out to be a synovial sarcoma in an 11 year old boy. Only make a diagnosis when you are sure of a specific diagnosis like bursitis, AVM, lipoma, PVNS or a cyst or hematoma. Cat scratch disease Here a 37 year old male who presented to the emergency department with pain, swelling and a mass at the left elbow that had been increasing over the last 3 weeks. On MR a mass was seen just above the medial epicondyle, where the epitrochlear lymph nodes live. The mass is very heterogeneous as is the enhancement. Based on the MR-findings you still have to call this mass indeterminate. The final diagnosis was cat scratch disease based on high Bartonella henselae titers. Here images of a 26 year old female who also came with a mass in the peritrochlear region. It looks quite homogeneous and cystic. Continue with the post-Gd image. Notice the inhomogeneous enhancement on the MRI and prominent internal vascularity on the sagittal ultrasound image. So this was not a cystic mass. Again this was diagnosed as indeterminate. The final diagnosis at biopsy was Lymphoma. Here some additional images of the nerve-sheath tumor look-a-like, which turned out to be a synovial sarcoma.
Neonatal Chest X-Ray:
Joost van Schuppen, Laura Kox, Wes Onland, Robin Smithuis and Rick van Rijn
Radiology, Nuclear medicine and Neonatology department of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre:
In this review we will discuss a systematic approach to the neonatal chest radiograph. 
Close collaboration between neonatologists and radiologists is the key in achieving the correct diagnosis, since the radiographic features of many lung disorders overlap and the findings on the chest film can be rather subtle.
Clinical information like age of the neonate, gestational age and therapy with ventilation or surfactant is vital for the interpretation of the radiological findings. We will first discuss a diagnostic approach based on radiographic and clinical findings and subsequently we will discuss the specific pulmonary diseases and complications. Interpretations of tube positions, lines and catheter positions are discussed in Tubes and lines in neonates.
Introduction:
Preterm infants show different types of pathology compared to
term infants. 
For example, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is almost
exclusively seen in preterm infants.
Meconium aspiration (MA) on the other
hand, is seen in full term or late term neonates in combination with
meconium-stained amniotic fluid during labor.
Infants born between 34 and 37 weeks of gestation can have
diseases occurring in both preterm and full-term infants. Invasive mechanical ventilation and surfactant therapy will
have a huge impact on the radiographic findings and are essential clinical information
for the radiologist. Here is a list of common pulmonary disorders in neonates
based on acute and chronic disease, complications of ventilation and congenital
anomalies (Table). * CPAM was previously referred to as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) and presents as a mass of abnormal non-functional lung tissue * TAPVR is total anomalous pulmonary venous return. The pulmonary veins do not connect to the left atrium, but enter the systemic venous circulation. The approach to the neonatal chest film starts by looking at the technique of the radiograph.
Then the position of lines and tubes is analyzed.
See Lines and tubes in Neonates.
After these steps, the chest film can be interpreted for pathology. This is done in a stepwise manner: The postnatal age of the neonate in days or hours is important as some disorders are acute conditions and some disorders at a present later stage. In addition, the course of illness and therapy so far should be taken into account.
Pattern Approach:
Chest abnormalities can be divided into: In some cases there is a combination of radiopaque and radiolucent abnormalities, which makes the interpretation of the radiographic findings challenging. 
For example, pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)
can be regarded as lucencies, but can also be interpreted as radiating linear radiopaque abnormalities.
Notice that a diaphragmatic hernia can be a focal radiopaque or radiolucent
Radiopaque - High Attenuation:
RDS Respiratory
distress syndrome in preterm neonates presents with low lungvolume, air
bronchograms and symmetric fine granular opacities, ranging from mild disease
to complete white out of the lungs. TTN
Transient tachypnea of the newborn is seen in full term neonates with mild respiratory distress and  presents with subtle increased lung volume, parahilar linear densities and pleural effusions. MAS
Meconium aspiration is seen in full term and late term neonates and presents with coarse bilateral densities, that can be asymmetrical. There can be areas of atelectasis and air-trapping. Atelectasis Atelectasis
can be seen in tube malpositioning and as complication, e.g. in RDS and meconium aspiration.
Radiolucent - Low attenuation:
Air Leak
Most radiolucent lung abnormalities are the result of air leakage usually as a complication of positive pressure ventilatory support and present as: Hyperinflation
It can be the result of malpositioning of the tube with hyperinflation of one lung or in the case of atelectasis, there can be compensatory hyperinflation of other lung parts. CPAMCPAM
is the most common congenital lung malformation, but is still a rare disease.
There is a microcystic and a macrocystic form. The latter presents as a
radiolucent abnormality. Often in the first hours the lesion is not containing
air yet and can present as radiopaque. Congenital diaphragmatic herniaThis is a birth defect of the diaphragm and can be a life threatening disease.
The herniation of abdominal organs into the chest results in underdevelopment of the lung.
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS):
RDS is also known as hyaline membrane disease (HMD), idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and surfactant deficiency disorder (SDD).
It is a result of deficiency of surfactant due to
immaturity of the lungs in preterm infants. Surfactant production starts between 24 to 28 week of gestational age. The incidence of RDS is inversely related to the gestational age at birth. It ranges from 50% in newborns at 26-28 weeks gestation and decreases to 25% in newborns at 30-31 weeks. As a result of the surfactant deficiency, the alveoli will not contain air and cause diffuse bilateral micro-atelectasis, in combination with fibrin and cellular debris due to alveolar damage, which leads to poor compliance of the lungs and prevents the newborn to expand the lungs properly. Endogenous production of surfactant will begin at approximately 36 - 72 hours regardless of the gestational age of the patient. Therefore, the diagnosis of RDS is restricted to the first week of life. Imaging Imaging findings are often most
severe at birth, but may peak at 12- 24 hours after birth.
In many preterm neonates improvements
in treatment, including antenatal glucocorticoid administration, surfactant
replacement therapy and better ventilatory strategies have decreased the
prevalence of RDS.
When prolonged
mechanical ventilation is necessary, this increases the risk of lung injury and air
leak and can evolve into chronic lung disease. 33 weeks + 5 weeks gestational age, day one.
First look at the image.
What are the findings? Findings: This is a typical case of RDS. 29 weeks + 1, day one. CPAP. 
First look at the image.
What are the findings? Findings: This is a severe case of RDS.
The differential diagnosis
includes pulmonary infection due to the asymmetric consolidation.
Grading:
Grading of RDS can be
performed but is not used when the patient is on invasive mechanical ventilation
support. There are 4 grades of staging RDS. As the lungs cannot expand
properly in RDS, hyperinflation in a preterm infant without mechanical
ventilation makes the diagnosis of RDS highly unlikely. Image

Respiratory distress syndrome One week old neonate, born at 27 weeks of gestational age. Image No grading because this neonate is on mechanical ventilation. Respiratory distress syndrome - surfactant treatment
Treatment:
Preventive treatment of RDS consists of antenatal
corticosteroid administration in women at risk for preterm
delivery. After birth, RDS may require treatment with exogenous
surfactant. 
If the infant is supported with ventilation, surfactant is administered intra-tracheally
as a liquid bolus. The clinical and radiological result of this treatment can often
be seen shortly after the administration of the surfactant. 
The surfactant is often not evenly distributed, which can lead to more patchy aeration of the lung parenchyma. 
Differentiation from other entities such as neonatal pneumonia
can be difficult. ImageOne day old boy, gestational age 25 weeks and 5 days.
Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN):
Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN) is also known as wet
lung or retained fetal lung liquid. TTN is a diffuse lung
disorder that results from delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid after birth,
leading to relative surfactant efficacy. 
It is seen more frequently – but not
exclusively – in full term neonates after cesarean delivery.
Delayed clearance of fetal
lung fluid causes transient respiratory distress that improves within 48–72
hours after birth. Imaging In many cases the clinical
presentation is mild and there is no need for a chest radiograph. Only in some cases a chest
x-ray is performed to rule out complications. 
The imaging findings may be
similar to those of RDS, showing diffuse granular opacities, or of pneumonia
with more coarse opacities. Full term infant, 2 hours after elective caesarean section with some respiratory distress. Image After

No need for ventilatory
support. Image Clinical follow up was uneventful 41 Weeks neonate. 24 hours old. 
Respiratory distress, no
ventilatory support Image Spontaneous improvement within 48 hours.
Meconium Aspiration:
Meconium aspiration results in diffuse pulmonary
disease and it is the most common cause of significant morbidity and mortality
among full-term and post-term neonates. When intra-uterine hypoxia occurs, usually during labor, this
can lead to the fetus prenatally excreting meconium. 
Inhalation of the meconium containing amniotic fluid results in a
chemical bronchiolitis with obstruction of the smaller airways
and surfactant dysfunction resulting in air trapping and
atelectasis. 
Meconium aspiration can impede the transition from prenatal fetal
circulation to postnatal neonatal circulation. In 10–15% of births meconium staining of the amniotic fluid is present, but only in 5% of these cases it will result in meconium aspiration. The term Meconium Aspiration Syndrome is used to describe the
combination of sterile chemical pneumonitis and persistent fetal circulation or
persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). 
Usually, this condition
presents within a few hours after birth. Imaging Chest film of a full term newborn with meconium stained amniotic fluid. Image Chest film of a full term newborn with meconium stained amniotic fluid. Image Conclusion: chest radiograph in
keeping with meconium aspiration. Without staining of the amniotic fluid the
differential diagnosis would include neonatal pneumonia or TTN. X-ray of a  full term newborn with meconium stained amniotic fluid. Image
Pulmonary hemorrhage:
Pulmonary hemorrhage is uncommon in neonates. Premature neonates are most at risk.
Other associated
factors are a persistent ductus arteriosus, surfactant treatment and mechanical
ventilation. The exact etiology remains unclear. 
The
radiographic signs are nonspecific and difficult to distinguish from other
disorders such as RDS.
This means that the diagnosis can only be made, when there is leakage of red blood or pink effusion from the
endotracheal tube. Supportive measurements consist of ventilator support and
sometimes xylometazoline or adrenalin, which is administered via
the tracheal tube. Mild hemorrhage can be hard to distinguish from RDS.
Massive bleedings show complete opacification of one or both lungs. Image The most likely diagnosis of this chest x-ray is RDS, but
given the clinical information of blood via the tracheal tube, the diagnosis is
pulmonary hemorrhage, possibly in combination with RDS. Image of a neonate with gestational age of 41 weeks.

diagnosis includes pneumonia and RDS in maternal diabetes. 
In case of meconium
stained amniotic fluid, mecoinum aspiration could be considered as well, but this
is often more coarse. Premature, 28 weeks of gestational age treated for RDS. 
Blood via the tracheal tube. Image
Persistent ductus arteriosus:
The ductus arteriosus is
the connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. 
Normally the ductus is open before birth and closes in term infants within
the first day after birth as arterioles feeding the wall of the ductus contract
in reaction to oxygen. Preterm infants have fewer of these arterioles and sometimes an increase in oxygen does not lead to closure of the duct, which might result
in a high pulmonary blood flow.  
The diagnosis usually is suspected 5 - 7 days after birth, when there is pulmonary overflow or systemic steal. Prostaglandin inhibitorsProstaglandin inhibitorscan be used to close the open duct.
In some cases, surgical closure can be achieved either via a lateral
thoracotomy with a clip, or later in life via an intra-arterial approach using
a coil. ProstaglandinsIn neonates with a ductal-dependent cardiac disorder Prostaglandins can be used to keep the ductus arteriosus
patent, which can be life-saving. Premature with previously normal chest radiographs. Image Ultrasound confirmed a persistent ductus arteriosus. Premature of 25 weeks and 5 days, now 2 month old. Treatement for RDS
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia:
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) also known as chronic lung
disease of the premature, is a disorder of lung injury and repair originally
ascribed to positive-pressure mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity. 
BPD is nowadays a purely clinical diagnosis characterized by the requirement of oxygen for at least 28 days in an infant born at less than 30 weeks of gestation. Before the advent of surfactant replacement therapy, chest
radiographs of infants with classic BPD demonstrated coarse reticular lung
opacities, cystic lucencies, and markedly disordered lung aeration that
reflected alternating regions of alveolar septal fibrosis and hyperinflated
normal lung. Nowadays after the introduction of prenatal steroids and
postnatal surfactant and more sophisticated ventilatory support, BPD is
infrequently seen in infants with a birth weight of more than 1200 grams and
over 32 weeks of gestational age. However, despite these advances in neonatal care, the
prevalence of BPD has changed little over the last decades due to the treatment
and improved survival rate of even more very preterm infants. As a result of these changes, the international criteria for
the diagnosis BPD were changed from 28 days postnatal age to 36 weeks postmenstrual
age. Therefore, the term BPD should be avoided before this
postmenstrual age. Premature, born at 27 weeks of gestational age. Now 6 weeks of age.

the history, BPD is the most likely diagnosis. Premature, born at 27 weeks of gestational age. Now 8 weeks

Bilateral diffuse
interstitial markings, with some atelectasis on the left. Given the history in combination with the radiological findings, BPD is the most likely diagnosis.
Atelectasis:
Complete atelectasis of the left lung Atelectasis often occurs due to malposition of tracheal
tubes, or to low positive pressure when using invasive mechanical ventilation. Failure to clear mucus or secretion can cause atelectasis by
plugging of mucus. Deficiency of surfactant can cause micro-atelectasis, leading
to diffuse atelectasis. Treatment depends on the cause of the atelectasis, such as
change of tracheal tube position, change in ventilatory support (pressure),
alternating position from side to side, or in case of surfactant deficiency, intratracheal administration of surfactant. ImageComplete atelectasis of the
left lung due to selective intubation on the right. PICC line in situ with tip

hypothermia treatment. Sudden respiratory distress. ImageBilateral opacification of the upper lobes most likely due to atelectasis.
There is some subtle streaky opacity most
pronounced retrocardial in the left lower lobe. This could be some atelectasis aswell.
Neonatal Pneumonia:
Pneumonia can be difficult
to distinguish from other entities such as RDS or bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
In the majority of cases the clinical course, together with intratracheal sputum cultures and biochemical parameters are leading in the diagnosis of pneumonia.
Without signs of infection, a consolidation on a chest radiograph is unlikely to be caused by pneumonia. Risk factors for neonatal pneumonia are: Neonate, GA 37+6 weeks, respiratory distress, treated with CPAP after delivery. History of maternal infection. First study the image.
What are the findings. Image 
Bilateral increased lung volume with asymmetric increased opacification of the lungs with subtle consolidation of right upper lobe (black arrow) and left lower lobe (white arrow). 
Hyperinflation of left upper lobe. This child developed signs of infection, both clinically and in the laboratory findings.
The radiographic findings were attributed to neonatal pneumonia. A full term neonate, with respiratory distress after 24 hours. Image 
Hyperinflation of both lungs and cardiac enlargement with increased
interstitial markings and vascular markings. No pleural fluid. The differential diagnosis includes TTN and neonatal pneumonia. After 48 hours there was no improvement of the respiratory distress, and the neonate developed signs of
infection. One
might argue that there could be a combination of TTN and pneumonia.
Ventilation associated complications:
Air leakage as a result of barotrauma in newborns present as: Pneumothorax can occur spontaneously or as a complication of
positive pressure ventilatory support. The introduction of surfactant treatment and improved
ventilatory support has significantly decreased the incidence. Rupture of terminal airways results from high pressure
insufflation of collapsed lung tissue. This causes air leakage into the
pulmonary interstitium, lymphatic system or pleural space. A specific finding on neonatal chest films is air leak
tracking along the bronchi termed pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE). Air within the interstitium can cause stiff and incompliant
lungs and diminished blood flow, leading to a reduced blood oxygenation. Pneumothorax can cause collapse of a lung, but in newborns the lungs are
relatively non-compliant and volume loss is often limited. When additional pneumomediastinum is present, a ‘lifted
thymus’ can be seen, also known as the ‘Spinnaker Sign’.
Pneumothorax:
Neonate 3 days old with RDS. Gestational age: 34 weeks.

What are the findings? Image PitfallIn newborns an important pitfall is the presence of a skin fold, which can be mistaken for a pneumothorax. Skinfolds do no follow anatomical borders and can be traced outside the chest cavity or cross-over pulmonary vessels. ImageA term newborn with an abdominal sepsis. 
There are signs of
fluid overload with accentuated blurry vessels. Skinfolds project over the right lower lung (arrows). 
The lines cross anatomical borders, e.g. diaphragm and do
not follow pleura or lungs. Left arm projecting over hemi-thorax, resulting in sharp

A pneumothorax is visible on the left side (arrow) Right image
On the follow up chest x-ray, the pneumothorax has spontaneously resolved. A pneumothorax can be very subtle, since in many neonatal
pulmonary disorders the lungs are not compliant and will not collapse. 
Often in
a supine neonate, the pneumothorax only manifests ventrally. Sometimes only sharpening of the mediastinal structures with
unilateral lucency is noted. Image Full term infant shortly after birth with mild pulmonary
distress. Due to fluid in
the lung parenchyma these lungs were stiff and did not collapse. Neonate 32 weeks gestational age. Treated for RDS via CPAP, with sudden respiratory
distress. First study the image.
What are the findings? Image
There is a  a pneumothorax on the right side.  
Midline structures are displaced to the left.
The left lungs
shows reticulonodular markings in keeping with RDS.
The right lung is not completely collapsed due to stiffness of the parenchyma in RDS and fluid.
Pneumomediastinum:
Pneumomediastinum is recognized as air inside the
mediastinum. The classical sign is the so-called spinnaker sign
(arrowhead). 
This is caused by the thymus being ‘lifted up’ from the lower
mediastinum by the mediastinal air. First study the image.
What are the findings? Image Image
Air can be recognized
between the thymus and the heart, which indicates a pneumomediastinum. No apparent pneumothorax is
recognized.  
The thymus
is uplifted on both sides (arrows). A cross table lateral view can help
to confirm the presence of a pneumothorax or a pneumomediastinum. Image

thymus and the heart, which indicates a pneumomediastinum.

Pulmonary Interstitial Emphysema (PIE):
Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is leakage of air into
the perivascular and peribronchial spaces as a result of rupture at the
bronchiolo-alveolar junctions.
PIE is recognized as either small bubbles or linear air
collections along the bronchovascular bundle radiating from hilum to the
periphery.
PIE can be bilateral or unilateral.
Once PIE is established, air may dissect centrifugally along
bronchovascular sheaths or lymphatic channels to form subpleural blebs, which
may rupture into the pleural space and produce a pneumothorax. ImagePreterm infant born at 27 weeks gestational age.

These are typical findings in PIE. Neonate, gestational age 27 weeks, treated for RDS.
At age of 2 days sudden deterioration. First study the images.
What are the findings? Image 1Bilateral reticulonodulair opacities in keeping with IRDS,

After
drainage there was a deterioration. Image 1
The radiograph shows bilateral radiating bubbly lucencies due to bilateral PIE.
This is more pronounced on the left side. Image 2
In follow up the child also developed a pneumothorax on the right side.
Congenital anomalies:
The most common congenital anomalies in neonates are:
Congenital pulmonary airway malformation:
Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) was until recently know as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM).
It is a spectrum of bronchopulmonary foregut malformations. There are three histological types: Image1 week old child, born at 41 weeks gestational age.
On prenatal routine imaging, a cystic lesion was seen in the upper left
lobe.
The radiograph shows a delineated lucent area in the apical part of the
left upper lobe (arrow).
There is a slight mediastinal shift to the right. Radiographic findings in CPAM Contrast
enhanced CT scan is essential in the analysis of CPAM and sequesters. 
Given that CPAM and sequester often are hybrid lesions,
feeding arterial vessels need to be visualized or ruled out before surgical
intervention. ImageCT scan of the same patient as above.
The lucent lesion in the left upper lobe has a multicystic aspect. Because the largest cyst has a diameter of more than 2 cm, this is classified as a
type I CPAM. Images of   a neonate, 40 weeks gestational age. 
Antenatal suspicion of large CPAM on the left side.

performed. 
CT shows a large cystic lesion in the upper lobe of
the left lung, with displacement of vascular and bronchial structures. 
The lesion has relation to any systemic vessel, Which excludes a sequester.
This is a CPAM, which is not yet aerated.
Pulmonary sequestration:
A pulmonary sequestration is a segment of dysplastic lung
tissue, which is separate from the rest of the lung. It receives an anomalous
systemic vascular supply. The most common type is the intralobar type, which is
situated within a normal lobe and has no own visceral pleura. 
Usually there is
a normal venous return via the pulmonary veins. In contrast the extralobar type is situated outside of the
normal lung and has a separate visceral pleural and a systemic venous return. Most sequestrations are detected on antenatal ultrasound and
present as a mass in the basal lobes, usually paramedian on the left. ImageNeonate, 39 weeks gestational age, antenatal suspicion of CPAM left lower
lobe. 
Radiograph shows a subtle, not well circumscribed lesion on the
left lower lobe.
CT at age of one month shows a mixed lesion, both cystic and
solid, with a large feeding artery from the descending aorta, in keeping with
sequester. Imaging Management is controversial. Some advocate surgical resection because of the risk of infection
and cardiac failure due to the left to right shunting. 
Others advocate a wait and
see approach, as these sequestrations can resolve spontaneously.
Before surgical management MR or CT is needed to analyze the blood supply and the type of the sequestration.
Congenital Lobar Emphysema:
Congenital lobar emphysema, now known as congenital lobar
overinflation, is a condition in which there is hyperexpansion of a lobe of the
lungs. Narrowing or weakness of a lobar bronchus causing a
check-valve mechanism is the most likely cause. Symptoms depend on the degree of lobar hyperexpansion. A mildly hyperexpanded lobe may be asymptomatic and decrease
in size with time and close follow-up is warranted in these cases. Progressive
hyperexpansion of a lobe can occur and cause significant, sometimes life-threatening,
symptoms. Those cases are treated with lobectomy. Usually congenital lobar emphysema is detected on prenatal ultrasound. Images of a term neonate with mild respiratory distress. 
Antenatal there was suspicion

Temporal Bone Anatomy 1.0:
Erik Beek and Robin Smithuis
Radiology department of the University Medical Centre of Utrecht and the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2006-07-15 Updated version: 21-2-2007 In this review we present the normal coronal and axial anatomy of the temporal bone. Learn the anatomy by scrolling through the images.
Temporal bone:
The middle ear consists of the tympanic cavity and the antrum. The antrum is a large aircell superior and posterior to the tympanic cavity and connected to the tympanic cavity via the aditus ad antrum. The epitympanum or attic is the upper portion of the tympanic cavity above the tympanic membrane, and contains the head of the malleus and the body of the incus. The tympanic membrane, the malleus, incus and stapes transfer soundwaves to the stapes footplate, which is attached to the base of the cochlea in the oval window.
Axial anatomy:

Scroll through the axial anatomy from inferior to superior:

Axial anatomy from inferior to superior:
At the most inferior level we see the facial nerve passing inferiorly to finally reach the stylomastoid foramen (not shown in this image). The carotid artery is shown within the carotid canal. Also at this level is the top of the jugular bulb.
Tympanic membrane:
The manubrium of the malleus (yellow arrow) is connected to the tympanic membrane. Malleus (yellow arow). Round window (blue arrow) At this level we can see the manubrium of the malleus (yellow arow) anterior to the long process of the incus. The round window is indicated by the blue arrow. The round window dissipates the pressure generated by the fluid vibrations within the cochlea and thus serves as a release valve. Stapes (green arrow) is seen connecting to the oval window.
Stapes:
The base of the stapes rocks in and out against the oval window. The vibrations are transmitted via the endolymph to the hair cells of the organ of Corti of the cochlea.
Cochlea:
Within the cochlea the movement of the hair cells convert the sound-vibrations into nerve impulses, that travel over the cochlear nerve to the auditory cortex of the brain, which interprets the impulses as sound. . The head of the malleus is seen anterior to the head of the incus (yellow arrow).
Tympanic segment of the facial nerve:
In this image at the level of the internal auditory canal, the tympanic segment of the facial nerve is seen just medial and parallel to the wall of the epitympanum. The head of the malleus (yellow arrow) is seen anterior to the head and the short process of the incus.
Geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve:
At this level the aditus ad antrum is seen. This is the connection between the tympanic cavity and the antrum. The labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve coming from the internal auditory canal angles sharply forward, nearly at right angles to the long axis of the petrous bone, to reach the geniculate ganglion. At the ganglion the facial nerve makes a U-turn (first genu of the facial nerve) to run posteriorly as the tympanic segment along the medial wall of the epitympanum.
Antrum:
The antrum is a large aircell superior and posterior to the tympanic cavity and connected to the tympanic cavity via the aditus ad antrum. It is surrounded by smaller mastoid aircells. On this last posterior coronal image the facial nerve assumes a vertical position to exit the petrous bone through the stylomastoid foramen. Enable Scroll

Coronal anatomy:
The petrous bone is positioned in an oblique orientation from posterolateral to anteromedial. As a result most structures will be sectioned obliquely on coronal images. The following coronal images go from anterior to posterior. First we will see the tympanic membrane with the ossicles, followed by the cochlea, antrum and semicircular canalls. Finally the most posterior image will show the point where the facial nerve exits the temporal bone at the stylomastoid foramen. Scutum (yellow arrow). Head of malleus (orange arrow) is seen medial to the incus (green arrow)
Scutum:
The scutum (yellow arrow) is a sharp bony spur formed by the lateral wall of the tympanic cavity and the superior wall of the external auditory canal. It is usually the first bony structure to erode as a result of a cholesteatoma, that is formed by medial retraction of the pars flaccida of the tympanic membrane into the epitympanum. If the retraction continues it will result in ossicular destruction. If the cholesteatoma passes posteriorly through the aditus ad antrum into the mastoid itself, erosion of the tegmen mastoideum, with exposure of the dura and erosion of the lateral semicircular canal with deafness and vertigo, may result. On the left the most anterior point of the facial nerve is seen (white arrow). At this point the nerve makes a U-turn. It is named the genu or geniculum and represents the geniculate ganglion. The malleus is seen connected to the tympanic membrane and to the incus. Coronal reconstruction clearly demonstates that the incus (I) is positioned posterolateral to the malleolar head (H).On the axial image the short crus of the incus is seen pointing posterolaterally. In many illustrations you will see the incus connecting medially to the malleus, but this is not correct. On the coronal reconstruction on the left it is clearly demonstated that the incus is positioned posterolaterally to the malleolar head. The long crus of the incus subsequently runs inferomedially to the stapes. Head of malleus (orange arrow) is seen medial to the Incus (green arrow) A coronal image slightly more posteriorly will show the facial nerve twice. The medial portion is the part that exits the internal auditory canal and runs towards the geniculate ganglion (medial white arrow). The lateral portion is the part that courses in a posterior direction, coming from the U-turn of the first genu. Long crus of the incus is seen connecting to the Stapes (blue arrow).Facial nerve in internal auditory canal and tympanic segment (white arrows).
Facial nerve canal:
The facial nerve is seen in the internal auditory canal and entering the temporal bone (medial white arrow). The lateral white arrow represents the tympanic segment of the facial nerve running in the facial canal and curving around the oval window niche. At this point, the nerve runs in a horizontal plane in a posterior direction superiorly to the oval window . The incus (orange arrow) is seen connecting to the stapes (blue arrow). Coronal scan showing the facial nerve (white arrow) above the oval window and below the lateral semicircular canal.

Contrast-enhanced MRA of peripheral vessels:
Tim Leiner
Department of Radiology, Maastricht University Hospital:
Publicationdate 2005-7-29 Contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) is more sensitive and specific for diagnosis and preinterventional work-up of Periferal Arterial Disease (PAD) compared to Duplex (1). CE-MRA detects more patent arteries than IA-DSA in patients with chronic critical ischemia and can modify the choice of therapeutic strategy in these patients (2). It is important to distinguish between patients with intermittend claudication and patients with chronic critical ischemia because they need a different imaging approach. In this overview guidelines are given how to tailor the MRA-examination by optimizing the use of surface coils, k-space filling, spatial resolution and contrast delivery. *by Tim Leiner Department of Radiology, Maastricht University Hospital, the Netherlands*
Periferal Arterial Occlusive Disease:
Patient with intermittend claudication on the left and an isolated stenosis in the left iliac artery.
Intermittend claudication:
Intermittend claudication is a benign form of periferal arterial occlusive disease.
Typically these patients have 'single level' disease usually an isolated stenosis in the iliac or femoral artery. Mostly these patients are treated with risk factor management and exercise training. There is only a relative indication for invasive therapy in order to relief the symptoms ( usually PTA, sometimes surgery). Only a limited number of these patients will progress to more severe disease i.e. critical ischemia. When MRA is performed in these patients perfect imaging of lower leg and feet is not the issue since no surgeon will perform a infragenual procedure in patients with these complaints. A one-step examination from aorta to the lower leg will usually be sufficient and venous filling is usually no issue. Patient with chronic critical ischemia and 'multi level' disease.
Chronic critical ischemia:
In patients with chronic critical ischemia
however, there is rest pain and/or tissue loss.
They typically have 'multi level' disease with bilateral, severe stenoses or occlusions in multiple arteries and segments. In critical ischemia there is an absolute indication for invasive therapy.
The goal is wound healing and limb saving. In these patients it is the job of MRA to find patent arteries in the lower leg or feet for bypass surgery with or without PTA. The utmost attempt must be made to find vessels in the lower legs and feet because if no arteries are found amputation will be unavoidable in most cases. A two-step examination is necessary. First you have to focus on the lower leg and feet with the best spatial resolution possible. Secondly the iliac and femoral level can be imaged. Venous enhancement from the first serie will usually not be a problem at these levels.
How to optimize the Imaging Protocol:

Equipment requirements:
Centric k-spacing provides the capability to acquire the optimal part of the central k-space during the arterial-phase of contrast enhancement in a short time-period. The remaining time is used for increasing spatial resolution. Venous enhancement will not be of much of a problem because if the outer k-space is filled with data this does not add much to the contrast in the image. The arterio-venous (AV) window will be enlarged allowing longer scan time. If centric k-space filling is not available use linear k-space filling (see tips and tricks). Surface coils Although some advocate the use of the bodycoil for imaging all three station, surface coils will dramatically improve image quality. Especially t in the lower leg and feet a surface coil is mandatory. a 3-station coil is optimal for MRA from the aorta to the feet. If not available use as many surface coils as possible. Synergy body and synergy spine coils are very helpfull,
Spatial resolution:
As a rule of thumb you need at least 3 pixels per vessel-diameter in order to reliably differentiate between 50% stenosis. So at different stations a different spatial resolution is needed (figure). Sagittal MIP of TOF-series from aorta to the level of the feet. Variation in width and angulation will result in a better coverage at the different levels.
Planning the series:
The CE-MRA series can be planned on a rough TOF-serie that gives you a good idea where the vessels of interest are located. Do not use the same box for every station, but adapt the size and the angulation of the boxes at iliac, femoral and crural level. Especially at the femoral level a small box usually is sufficient. This will save time and allows you to speed up going to the lower leg. Large lower box to cover the pedal arch At the crural level especially if the pedal arch has to be included a large box will be needed. The spatial resolution at this level has to be high. This results in more thin slices and a longer scan time. How to beat venous enhancement in the lower leg when there is a longer scantime is explained later. Three station CE-MRA in patient with intermittent claudication. Fast scanning was possible with SENSE.
Contrast bolus-timing:

Injection protocol:
In patients with intermittent claudication a one-step examination with imaging of 3 sequential stations is optimal. In patients with critical ischemia first the lower legs with the pedal arch included are examined. Secondly a separate contrast injection is necessary for the examination of the Aorto-Iliac and Femoral station. Depending on the speed of the MR-system contrast can be delivered at a higher rate.
Tips and Tricks in MRA:
Dedicated imaging of crural arteries and pedal arch in patient with critical ischemia.
How to beat venous enhancement in lower legs:
Prolong the arterio-venous (AV) window by venous compression. Use a midfemoral compression with a pressure cuff at 50-60 mmHg. A normal blood pressure cuff without the metal parts usually works fine. Use centric k-space filling if available. If ontrast appears in the veins, this will not add much to the contrast in the image as at that moment the periferal lines of k-space are scanned, which mostly add to he resolution in the image. In patients with critical ischemia do a biphasic examination to concentrate first on lower leg and feet.
Centric k-spacing not available:
At the iliac level centric k-spacing is not necessary. Linear filling of k-space works good at this level and provides the advance that the sequence can be started in front of the arrival of the contrast-bolus. If centric k-spacing is not available at your MR-machine, use linear filling of k-space at all levels. At the level of the lower leg and feet the arterial contrast in the images will be less optimal and the risk of venous enhancement will be greater. A 3-station coil.
3-station coil not available:
A 3-station coil is optimal for MRA from the aorta to the feet. If not available use as many surface coils as possible. Synergy body and synergy spine coils are very helpfull, Use the best surface coil that you have for imaging the lower leg and feet and consider to do a biphasic examination.
Problems with breath-hold:
The most important issue in MRA of the aorta and iliac arteries is that the patient manages to hold his breath. A lower resolution breath-hold scan is superior to a higher resolution scan with breathing artifacts. Before the actual series start you need to practise the breath-hold with the patient. If adequate breath-hold is not possible than you have shorten scantime by lowering the matrix-size and increasing the slice thickness at the expense of in-plane resolution.

When you analyse the wrist to look for possible carpal instability and fracture dislocation, you should ask yourself the following questions: Is there good positioning of the patient. This is essential to be able to make statements about improper alignment or abnormal axes of carpal bones. Is there normal alignment between the carpal bones. The carpals should be parallel when profiled. Any overlap indicates abnormal tilting, dislocation or fracture. Is there any disruption of the three carpal archs. Disruption indicates ligament tear or a fracture. What is the shape and axis of the carpal bones. Give special attention to lunate, scaphoid and capitate. An abnormal shape indicates abnormal tilt with or without dislocation. Answering these questions will help you find clues to carpal instability, dislocation and fractures.
Radiography:
Positioning
PA view should be taken with the wrist and elbow at shoulder height. Only in this position, the radius and the ulna are parallel. Moving the arm down makes the radius cross the ulna and become relatively shorter. So it will be impossible to make any statements on the length of the ulna (plus or minus variant)
Lateral view is taken with the elbow adducted to the side. Shoulder, elbow and wrist are again in one plane. This positioning will make the lateral view exactly perpendicular to the PA view. Extensor carpi ulnaris groove (yellow arrow) seen radial to the midportion of the ulnar styloid. PA view A correctly positioned PA view will show the extensor carpi ulnaris groove radial to the midportion of the ulnar styloid. The PA and lateral view are equally important and thus should both be studied carefully. The PA view usually shows what is wrong and the lateral view shows in what direction the bones move. 
Sometimes an oblique view will also be obtained, especially if you want to look at the trapezium-trapezoid joint in profile. Lateral view Only on a good positioned lateral view one can see the volar edges of respectively scaphoid, pisiform and capitate separately and lined up as shown on the left. Lunate is the semilunar bone that fits in the distal radius. Looking through that, one can see the convexity of the scaphoid. Distally from the scaphoid is the trapezium. The angular shaped bone visible dorsally is the triquetrum. The square bone that bridges the proximal and distal half of the wrist is the pisiform. Capitate is the rounded bone fitting inside the distal lunate. Distally between the metacarpals, one can make out the hook of the hamate. Same projection of ulna and ulnar styloid on PA and lateral view due to malpositioning in a patient with a perilunate fracture dislocation. Improper positioning may result in the same view of the ulna on both the PA and lateral view as shown in the case on the left. Nowhere in the body you would accept two views giving you the same image of a bone. Normal oblique radiograph of the wrist and schematic representation Oblique view An oblique view is not routinely performed. It is however the only view showing the trapezio-trapezoidal joint.
Joint spaces: parallelism and symmetry:
The joint spaces of the wrist have a width of 2 mm or less. Only the radiocarpal joint is slightly wider. The carpometacarpal joints are slightly narrower than the midcarpal joints. The capitolunate joint is considered the baseline joint width to which other joint spaces can be compared. One should make sure to look at all of them: the radiocarpal, the proximal intercarpal, the midcarpal, the distal intercarpal and the carpometacarpal joint spaces. Study the carpal bones as pieces of a jigsaw puzzleLEFT: Schematic representation of the wrist with the outlines tracing the outer margins of the bonesRIGHT: Schematic representation of the wrist with the lines tracing the carpal bones as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle Carpal joints should be symmetrical. Furthermore, when viewed in profile (tangentially), the cortical margins of the bones constituting that joint should be parallel. Bone edges that are not viewed in profile do not display this parallelism, e.g. the distal portion of the scaphoid that articulates with the capitate. Studying this parallelism is easier when regarding the carpal bones as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that all fit together, as opposed to tracing carpal bones by their outer cortical margins producing the outlines (figure). When one bone is not paralleling the others, that is out of place. If the rest of the bones still parallel each other, they have stayed together. PA radiograph and schematic representation of the wrist, with dislocation of the lunate The picture on the left shows abnormal overlapping of the lunate with the capitate, hamate and triquetrum. We also see the medial profile surface of the scaphoid, but nothing paralleling it. There is also abnormal widening of the radiolunate space. The other joints are nicely parallel and symmetric. This leads to the conclusion that the lunate is displaced while the other bones have stayed together.
Carpal arcs:
PA radiograph of the wrist. The three normal carpal arcs The next step is looking at the three carpal arcs: smooth curves joining the surfaces of the carpal bones as shown on the left. The first arc is a smooth curve outlining the proximal convexities of the scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum. The second arc traces the distal concave surfaces of the same bones, and the third arc follows the main proximal curvatures of the capitate and hamate. PA radiograph of the wrist and schematic representation showing disruption of the first carpal arc Distruption of carpal arcs An arc is disrupted if it cannot be traced smoothly. A break in one of the arcs indicates a fracture or the disruption of a ligament leading to a subluxation or dislocation. On the left one can note the disruption of arc I at the lunotriquetral joint. Disruption of the second carpal arc A disruption of the second carpal arc at the scapholunate joint and the lunotriquetral joint is seen on the left. Although there is a gap in the first arc, it can still be traced by a smooth curve so arc I is considered intact. Disruption of the third carpal arc at the capitohamate joint Disruption of the third carpal arc is shown in the next case on the left. There is an abnormal step off at the capitohamate joint.
Shape of carpal bones:
Schematic representation of the lunate shape in different positions
Lunate shape:
The lunate has a trapezoidal shape, as the sides converge from the proximal surface to the distal surface, which are grossly parallel. If the lunate is tilted, it becomes triangular in shape. Awareness of this fact prevents thinking the lunate might be dislocated based only on its appearance, that in fact changes with its position. So it may be dislocated with tilting or just be tilted. LEFT: Lunate dislocation: capitate is centered over the radius and lunate is tilted out.RIGHT: Perilunate dislocation: lunate is centered over the radius and capitate is tilted out dorsally.
Lunate vs. perilunate dislocation:
Common dislocations of the wrist are the lunate and perilunate dislocations. The key to differentiation between both is what is centered over the radius. If the capitate is centered over the radius and the lunate is tilted out, it is a lunate dislocation. If however the lunate centers over the distal radius and the capitate is dorsal, we are dealing with a perilunate dislocation (figure). LEFT: Lateral radiograph of the wrist in extention showing scaphoid elongationRIGHT: PA radiograph of the wrist in ulnar deviation showing elongation of the scaphoid
Scaphoid shape:
The scaphoid shape changes with movement of the wrist. In ulnar deviation or extension the scaphoid elongates to fill the space between the radial styloid and the base of the thumb (the trapezium). LEFT: PA radiograph of the wrist in radial deviation showing foreshortening of the scaphoid: signet ring signRIGHT: Schematic representation of the wrist in flexion showing tilting of the scaphoid towards the palm Both with radial deviation aswell as flexion of the wrist the space between the radial styloid and trapezium is reduced. As scaphoid fills this space it will foreshorten and tilt towards the palm. This will give scaphoid a signet ring appearance (figure).
Axis of the carpal bones:
Drawing the longitudinal axes of some of the carpal bones on a lateral radiograph and measuring the angles between them is a good method of determining the wrist bones? spatial relationship. The three most important axes are those through the scaphoid, the lunate and the capitate, drawn on the lateral radiograph.
Scaphoid axis:
The true axis of the scaphoid is the line through the midpoints of its proximal and distal poles. Since the midpoint of the proximal pole is often difficult to appreciate, an almost parallel line can be used that is traced along the most ventral points of the proximal and distal poles of the bone (figure). LEFT: Lunate axis drawn perpendicular to a line joining the distal palmar and dorsal bordersRIGHT: Radiograph with lunate and scaphoid axis drawn.
Lunate axis:
The axis of the lunate runs through the midpoints of the convex proximal and concave distal joint surfaces and can best be drawn by finding the perpendicular to a line joining the distal palmar and dorsal borders of the bone as demonstrated on the left. **Scapholunate angle Normal: 30 - 60? Questionably abnormal: 60 - 80? Abnormal: > 80?** This indicates instability of the wrist. LEFT: Capitate axisRIGHT: Radiograph with lunate and capitate axis drawn.
Capitate axis:
The capitate axis joins the midportion of the proximal convexity of the third metacarpal and that of the proximal surface of the capitate. **Capitolunate angle Normal:
Abnormal: > 30?.**This indicates instability of the wrist. LEFT: Dorsal tilting of the lunate in DISIRIGHT: Scapholunate angle is > 80?
DISI or dorsiflexion instability:
DISI is short for dorsal intercalated segmental instability. The intercalated segment is the proximal carpal row identified by the lunate. The term 'intercalated segment' refers to it being the part in between the proximal segment of the wrist consisting of the radius and the ulna and the distal segment, represented by the distal carpal row and the metacarpals. So all this means is that in DISI or dorsiflexion instability the lunate is angulated dorsally. If you think lunate is tilted, measure the scapholunate angle ( 30-60?is normal, 60-80?is questionably abnormal, >80? is abnormal) and the capitolunate angle ( In the figure on the left the scapholunate angle is measured: it is 105 degrees. As mentioned before this angle is considered abnormal if greater then 80 degrees. LEFT: Volar tilting of the lunate in VISIRIGHT: Scapholunate angle is
VISI or volarflexion instability:
Volar intercalated segmental instability or palmar flexion instability is when the lunate is tilted palmarly too much. While most DISI is abnormal, in many cases VISI is a normal variant, especially if the wrist is very lax.
Systematic review and diagnosis:
In the next cases we advise you to first look at the images on the left and give a full description of the radiographs. Look for symmetry, parallelism, and the shape and axis of the carpal bones. Find out if there are any fractures and then try to make the diagnosis Then read the text on the right to see if you're right. PA and lateral view of the wrist Case 1 Systematic interpretation of the case on the left shows us the following: On the PA-view all the carpal bones parallel each other except for the lunate. The carpal arcs I and II are disrupted at the LT and SL joints. Triangular shaped lunate So by just looking at the PA view we can make the diagnosis of lunate dislocation. Case 2 Analysis: No parallelism at the TL joint since there is overlapping of the triquetrum and the lunate. Also overlapping of the hamate and the lunate. There is parallelism between radius, lunate, proximal pole of scaphoid and proximal pole of capitate. So these bones form a unit. Also parallelism between triquetrum, hamate, distal pole of capitate, trapezium and distal pole of scaphoid. Fracture of capitate and scaphoid So these findings indicate that this is a transscaphoid, transcapitate perilunate fracture-dislocation. On the left you see the same case with a line indicating the fracture-dislocation line. Same case with additional oblique and lateral view showing the dorsal dislocation. Case 3 Analysis: Fracture of scaphoid and ulnar styloid process. Broken arcs I and II at LT joint. Some parallelism between lunate and proximal pole of scaphoid with the radius. Scaphoid is foreshortened so it is tilted and has moved towards the palm. All the other carpals show parallelism exept for lunate, the proximal pole of scaphoid and the radius. Although this probably is a perilunate dislocation, based on the PA-view alone it is very difficult to say if this is a lunate or perilunate dislocation. The triangular shape of the lunate could be the result of just tilting or dislocation with tilting. Perilunate dislocation with fracture of scaphoid and ulnar styloid processThe volar tip of lunate is also broken (see circle). Same case with the lateral view also shown. Now we see that there definitely is a perilunate dislocation. So the triangular shape of the lunate is the result of just tilting. On the lateral view a fracture of the volar tip of lunate is seen. So this patient is at risk for recurrent dislocation. Case 4 Analysis: The case on the left shows severe arthrosis at the STT joint and CMC1 joint with subluxation. Carpal arcs are normal and there is normal paralelism.The scaphoid is elongated which means it is dorsally tilted. On the lateral view we can see that the lunate is also tilted dorsally. The proximal carpal row has moved as a unit, so there is no dissociation. Final diagnosis: non-dissociated DISI with arthrosis and subluxation of STT joints. Case 5
Analysis: Loss of parallelism at LT joint resulting in broken arc I and II. Lunate and scaphoid are parallel to each other but not to the other carpals. Scaphoid is foreshortened due to palmar tilting. Lunate is parallel to scaphoid. So the triangular shape must be the result of palmar tilting. The proximal carpal row is not a unit since arc I is broken. Lateral view demonstrates the volar tilting of lunate which was already suspected on the PA view. Final diagnosis: VISI with dissociation at the LT joint. Case 6
Analysis: Widened and narrowed joints, but there is normal parallelism , so there is no dislocation. Scapholunate dissociation with widening of the SL joint and foreshortening of the scaphoid due to palmar tilt. Arthrosis of the Radioscaphoid and Capitolunate joint due to the abnormal movements of scaphoid and lunate. This condition is known as SLAC. In this case it is post-traumatic due to the SL-ligament tear. SLAC (scapholunate advanced collapse) refers to a specific pattern of osteoarthritis and subluxation which results from untreated chronic scapholunate dissociation or from chronic scaphoid non-union The degenerative changes occur in areas of abnormal loading, which is the radial-scaphoid joint, followed by degeneration in the unstable lunatocapitate joint, as capitate subluxates dorsally on lunate. SLAC of CPPD TYPE On the left another case of SLAC. This case is due to CPPD. Characteristics of CPPD with SLAC are: Decreased size of proximal scaphoid due to erosion and resorption.

Müllerian duct anomalies:

Department of Radiology of the Meander Medisch Centrum of Amersfoort and of the University Medical Center of Utrecht, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 20-6-2021 Variant
anatomy and true anomalies of the female internal genitalia are very common.
Diagnosis is important, not only to understand future risk of complications,
but also because some anomalies may benefit from treatment. Attempting
to master this topic by simply memorizing different variants is a suboptimal
approach: Müllerian duct anomalies (MDAs) are not a discreet set, but a
continuous spectrum of aberrations. With a little knowledge of the underlying
embryology, clinical classifications of MDAs are easier to understand, and the
reader is better equipped to deal with the inevitable overlap in appearance
encountered in clinical practice. This
article begins with a very brief summary of embryological Müllerian duct
development and then takes you through the spectrum of MDAs on the basis of the
European (ESHRE/ESGE) consensus classification, providing more in-depth developmental
details along the way. Imaging
protocols are also briefly addressed, and we provide a checklist to help with
reporting of MDAs.
Embryology:
The female reproductive tract develops from a pair of Müllerian ducts that form the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and the upper two-thirds of the vagina.
The ovaries and lower third of the vagina have a different embryological origin (genital ridge and urogenital sinus, respectively). First there is formation of the paired Müllerian ducts, followed by fusion of the two ducts into a single uterus, cervix and upper vagina. Finally resorption of the septum will lead to a normal
cavum.
Failure of formation of the Müllerian ducts can result in an aplastic or
hemi-uterus.
Failure or incomplete fusion of the ducts can result
in a bicorporeal uterus. Non or incomplete septal resorption results in a
septate uterus.
Associated anomalies:
There is a close relation between the paramesonephric ducts of Müller and the mesonephric ducts of Wolff. The latter play an important role in development of the urinary tract and the kidneys. 
Therefore abnormalities of the urinary tract often coexist with MDAs, in 30-50% of cases. 
Usually urinary tract anomalies are unilateral and ipsilateral to the malformed Müllerian duct derivative. The incidence of vertebral anomalies is higher in patients with an MDA and reported in up to 29% of cases.
Classification of Müllerian duct anomalies:
European classification system ESHRE/ESGE. Click for larger view. The table shows the European classification system ESHRE/ESGE from 2013. Class U0 is a normal uterus Class U1 is a dysmorphic shaped uterus either as a T-shaped cavum due to abnormally thick uterine walls or as a T-shaped cavum due to an abnormal outer contour (infantilis). Class U2 is the result of failure of resorption of the septum. There is an internal indentation. The outer contour of the uterus is normal and this differentiates the septate uterus from the bicorporeal uterus. Class U3 is a bicorporeal uterus with a left and right corpus as a result of failure of fusion. The outer contour is abnormal with an external cleft of the fundus. A bicorporeal septate uterus has both an external cleft and a septum. Class U4 is a hemi-uterus as a result of unilateral failure of formation of the Müllerian duct. Class U5 is an aplastic uterus as a result of bilateral failure of formation of the Müllerian ducts. Class U6 are unclassified cases
Imaging:
HSG showing abnormal uterine cavity. Differentiation between septate and bicorporeal uterus is not possible
Hysterosalpingography:
Müllerian duct anomalies are often first detected on hysterosalpingography (HSG) during the work-up of infertility. HSG has a limited role in the diagnosis of MDA's as it only gives information about the uterine cavity and not about the external contour of the uterus.
The next step in the diagnosis is often ultrasound or MRI. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
Ultrasound:
Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound are often the first imaging modalities used to evaluate the internal sex organs. 
When indeterminate or complex, MR imaging is used. The transabdominal ultrasound shows a uterus with normal external contour of the fundus. 
Internal indentation in the cavum is present continuous to the level of the internal os of the cervix. Classification: U2b - complete septate uterus.
MRI:
MRI is considered the gold standard in the classification of MDAs due to the detailed anatomic information provided. In this patient the HSG shows a single, off-midline cavity with a hydrosalpinx.
Further analysis was done with MRI. Continue with the MR-images. Enable Scroll

off-midline positioned uterus on the right. No rudimentary horn is present on the left side. The cervix is not necessary to mention in the final
classification of this case, since a hemi-uterus it is usually accompanied by
unilateral cervical aplasia. The vagina does not show any abnormalities (V0). Kidneys showed normal anatomy (not shown). Classification: U4bV0. * planes angulated along the axis of the uterine body
MRI protocol:
For patient preparation the use of an anti-peristaltic agent is recommended as well as an empty urinary bladder prior to imaging. 
Vaginal opacification with ultrasound gel can be used when vaginal pathology is expected. 
In menstruating patients imaging during secretory phase can be considered.
How to report Müllerian duct anomalies:

Checklist:
Click for larger view Besides the main classes of the uterine anomalies a co-existent class is used for describing the cervix and vagina.  
When unsure about the classification, a description of the findings is sufficient to avoid improper use of the classes.
Besides the female genital tract anomalies always report on the kidneys.
U0 normal uterus:
U0 was added to the classification to be able to describe abnormalities of the cervix or vagina in co-existent classes in combination with a normal uterus.
U1 dysmorphic uterus:
SubclassU1a T-shaped 
Narrow uterine cavity due to thickened lateral walls with a correlation 2/3 corpus and 1/3 cervix. SubclassU1b InfantilisNarrow uterine cavity without thickened lateral walls and inverse correlation of 1/3 corpus and 2/3 cervix lenght. SubclassU1c all othersGroup including all minor deformities of the uterine cavity. Usually, dysmorphic uteri are smaller in size.
U2 septate uterus:
SubclassU2aPartial septate uterus with an internal indentation of more than 50% of the uterine wall thickness dividing the uterine cavity above the level of the internal cervical os. SubclassU2b 
Complete septate uterus. The septum divides the uterine cavity up to the level of the internal cervical os. A hysteroscopic septum resection can be performed to improve reproductive outcomes. Enable Scroll

U3 bicorporeal uterus:
SubclassU3aPartial bicorporeal uterus. Indentation not reaching the cervix and no septum (<150% UWT) SubclassU3bComplete bicorporeal uterus. Indentation reaching up to the level of the cervix. Possibly including the cervix and vagina. In 75% a longitudinal vaginal septum is present. SubclassU3cBicorporeal septate uterus. Indentation not reaching the cervix in combination with a septum (>150% UWT). In 25% a longitudinal vaginal septum is present. When the fusion of the Müllerian ducts fails, a bicorporeal uterus is encountered (also known as bicornuate uterus). 
When there is no fusion at all, this leads to a
complete duplication of uterine horns, cervix and often also of the proximal
vagina (also known as uterus didelphys). Subclass U3a and U3b usually do not need surgical intervention unless a vaginal septum is present.
When symptomatic, e.g. pain during intercourse, the septum can be resected. Enable Scroll

This is seen consistent with the Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome.
This is also known as OHVIRA - obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesia. 
The contralateral kidney is hypertrophic (arrow).
U4 hemi-uterus:
SubclassU4aHemi-uterus with a rudimentary functional cavity,
communicating or non-communicating. SubclassU4b
Hemi-uterus with no horn or a horn without rudimentary cavity. In case of arrest in formation of one of the Müllerian ducts, a hemi-uterus develops (also
knows as unicornuate uterus).
As mentioned before, hemi-uterus is often accompanied
by cervical aplasia and therefore it is not necessary to mention this in the
final classification. Special attention has to be paid to the presence of
endometrium in a rudimentary cavity.
In case of non-communication, hematometra and
endometriosis may be present. 
Even a pregnancy can occur in a functional rudimentary
cavity with the chance of uterine rupture. On T2WI the presence of endometrium can be evaluated
and in particular post-contrast T1WI or DWI may be helpful. A hemi-uterus does not need surgical intervention.
The presents of a rudimentary horn however is
essential to report for the aforementioned reason.

Usually there is a complete agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.
The typical form of MRKH syndrome (type I) is characterized by congenital absence of uterus, cervix and upper vagina.
The atypical form (type II) is characterized by the presence of both Müllerian duct anomalies and also non-gynaecological anomalies of urological, skeletal, vertebral or cardiac systems. On MRI the non-developed rudimentary tissue may be present with low signal on T2WI. 
These bilateral ‘uterine buds’ may be seen as fibrous linear structures, and a rudimentary uterus as triangular shaped tissue on the bladder dome.

V3 hymen imperforatus:
During embryology the fused Müllerian ducts grow
downward until colliding with the primitive urogenital sinus. 
There the
tuberculum of Muller is formed, following by the growth of two solid evaginations
i.e. the bulbi sinovaginalis. 
The two bulbi fuse together and proliferate,
forming a massive cellular plate around the 3th month of gestation. 
This plate
is called the vaginal plate.
Downward canalization follows, after which the
upper and lower vagina stay separated by the hymen. Normally the hymen
perforates around birth. If the canalization of the
vaginal plate is not completed or the perforation of the hymen doesn’t
occur, mucus from the cervical glands, which are stimulated
by the maternal estrogen, collects above the hymen. This may lead to hydrometrocolpos and to
hematometrocolpos if it manifests after the menarche. Images Kidneys showed normal anatomy (not shown). Imaging of Müllerian duct anomalies by Spencer C. Behr, MD • Jesse L. Courtier, MD • Aliya Qayyum, MBBS RadioGraphics 2012; 32:E233–E250

Special Ankle Fractures:

Detection of 'Not So Obvious' Fractures:
Robin Smithuis
Radiology Department of the Rijnland Hospital, Leiderdorp, the Netherlands:
Publicationdate 2012-10-01 The ankle is the most frequently injured joint. Management decisions are based on the interpretation of the AP and lateral X-rays. In this article we will focus on detection of fractures, that may not be so obvious at first sight. Before you read this article, you need to understand the classification of ankle fractures and exorotation injuries that were highlighted in Ankle - Fractures 1 and 2.
Posterior malleolus fractures:
Almost all fractures of the posterior malleolus are part of a rotational injury resulting in a Weber B or Weber C fracture. The tertius fracture is stage 3 in Weber B and stage 4 in Weber C (figure). In some cases the tertius fractures are easily seen on the x-rays, but frequently they can be difficult to detect. It is important to find these fractures, since a tertius fracture can be the only clue to an unstable ankle injury. Ankle - Fractures 2 - Fracture mechanism and Radiography Linear lucency indicating a fracture of the posterior malleolus When we study the radiographs of a patient with an ankle injury, we have to study the region of the posterior malleolus very carefully. In many cases there is only a small gap between the fracture parts and detection depends on optimal radiography and a high level of suspicion. The images show an obvious Weber B fracture. On the AP-view the linear lucency is the clue to a tertius fracture (red arrow). It results from subtle malalignment of the fracture fragment. Likewise in some cases malalignment can result in a linear density. Trimalleolar Weber B fracture In this case there is a Weber B fracture with avulsion of the medial malleolus. The bright line on the AP-view indicates a large tertius fracture fragment. This tertius fracture can also be seen on the lateral view, but in many cases we need all the information of both the lateral and AP-view to diagnose a tertius fracture. Here more examples of the bright line that indicates a tertius fracture. In some cases a fracture of the posterior malleolus is barely or not visible on the radiographs and can only be seen on CT. First study the radiographs and then continue with the CT. By the way....there are two fractures. You can enlarge the images by clicking on them. The CT shows an avulsion of the tertius at the insertion of the posterior syndesmosis (red arrows). The alignment is so perfect, that you do not see the fracture on the radiographs. Maybe the fracture is seen on the AP-view as indicated by the red arrows, but this is questionable. Notice that there is also an avulsion at the tibial insertion of the anterior syndesmosis, i.e. Tillaux fracture. This combination of findings implicate that the ankle is unstable. A syndesmotic screw has to be inserted. . Here we have images of an extremely difficult case. This woman had a distortion of the ankle and had pain on both medial and lateral side. She was referred to the radiology department by her general practitioner. The technician made the standard AP-, Mortise- and lateral view and showed them to the radiologist, who was a little bit puzzled. First study the images and then continue reading. The findings are: The radiologist decided first to order a CT to find out if there really was a tertius fracture. Continue with the CT and be amazed. Enable Scroll

Disable Scroll Scroll through the images. It is amazing, that such a large tertius fragment is so difficult to see on the radiographs. Also notice the soft tissue swelling on the medial side indicating rupture of the medial collateral ligaments (arrow). Do you have an idea what kind of injury this is? Medial soft tissue swelling and a tertius fracture are both indications of a Weber C or Pronation Exorotation injury. Since there is no fibula fracture seen on the x-rays of the ankle, there must be a high fibular fracture. At physical exam there was some swelling on the medial side and although the patient did not complain of any pain higher in the lower leg, there was some tenderness when the fibula was palpated. This spot was marked and a fracture was found. This case illustrates the importance of medial soft tissue swelling aswell as the finding of a tertius fracture. According to Lauge Hansen we can conclude that this patient first had a rupture of the medial collateral ligaments (stage 1), followed by a rupture of the anterior syndesmosis (stage 2) and a high fibula fracture (stage 3) and finally an avulsion of the posterior malleolus, i.e. PE stage 4. At surgery the ankle was found to be unstable and syndesmosis screws were inserted. There was an indication for fixing the posterior malleolar fracture, since the fragment involved more than 25% of the articular surface of the distal tibia. This patient had a twisted ankle and the only abnormality is seen on the lateral view. This was thought to be an avulsion of the posterior malleolus. Knowing that this can be the only clue to a high Weber C, additional radiographs were taken. Continue with the images of the lower leg. A subtle high fibula fracture is seen (arrow). Final diagnosis is a Weber C fracture or according to Lauge Hansen: Pronation Exorotation injury stage 4.
Isolated Tertius fracture:
A fracture of the posterior malleolus as an isolated finding is very uncommon. It is seen when someone's foot hits the ground and a fragment of the posterior malleolus is pushed off by the talus. The size of this fragment depends on the direction of the force (figure).
Salter-Harris fractures:
The Salter-Harris classification describes fractures that involve the epiphyseal plate or growth plate. The most common is type II, which accounts for 75%. These Salter-Harris fractures can be easily missed. In many cases there is only minimal or no displacement. The fracture through the growth plate is usually obscure and difficult to differentiate from normal variations of the growth plate.
And finally we tend not to look carefully at the epiphysis.
Type I:
Type I Salter-Harris fractures tend to occur in younger children (5). It is a transverse fracture through the cartilage of the growth plate or physis. Often, x-rays of a child with a type I growth plate fracture will appear normal. Most type I growth plate injuries are treated with a cast. Healing of type I fractures tends to be rapid and complications are rare.
Type II:
A type II growth plate fracture starts across the growth plate, but the fracture then continues up through the metaphysis. This is the most common type of growth plate fracture, and tends to occur in older children. Often type II growth plate fractures must be repositioned under anesthesia, but healing is usually quick and complications are uncommon. Enable Scroll

Type III:
Type III is a fracture through the growth plate and epiphysis sparing the metaphysis. A type III fracture also starts through the growth plate, but turns and exits through the end of the bone, and into the adjacent joint.
These injuries can be concerning because the joint cartilage is disrupted by the fracture. Proper positioning is essential after a type II growth plate fracture. These injuries also tend to affect older children in whom the growth plate is partially closed. Study the images and then scroll to the next images. The fracture through the epiphysis can be easily missed (blue arrow). The fracture through the growth plate is only seen on CT. Continue with the CT images. The CT-images nicely display the fracture through the growth plate and the epiphysis. Enable Scroll

Type IV:
Type IV is a fracture through all three elements of the bone, the growth plate, metaphysis and epiphysis. Notice that the epiphyseal fracture is in the sagittal plane, the fracture through the growth plate is in the axial plane and the metaphyseal fracture is in the coronal plane. These fractures are also named triplane fractures. These are discussed in the next chapter. Proper positioning is also essential with type IV growth plate fractures, and surgery may be needed to hold the bone fragments in proper position.
Type V:
Type V growth plate injuries occur with the growth plate is crushed. Type V growth plate fractures carry the most concerning prognosis as bone alignment and length can be affected. These types of fractures may permanently injure the growth plate, requiring later treatment to restore alignment of the limb.
Triplane fracture:
Triplane fracture This fracture is named triplane because it occurs in the coronal, sagittal and axial plane. It is actually a Salter-Harris type IV. It is seen exclusively in young adolescents in the period, when the medial tibial epiphysis is closed, while the lateral portion is still open leaving it vulnerable to injury. As the force cannot continue into the medial part of the growth plate since this is already closed, the epiphysis will fracture. As in most ankle fractures the mechanism is external rotation. The injury results in: Study the images and then continue reading. Triplane fracture At first this looks like a Weber B fracture with an oblique fracture in the fibula as seen on the lateral view (black arrows). Notice however that this fracture line stops at the level of the epiphyseal plate. So this is the fracture of the metaphysis in the coronal plane. On the AP-view there is a lucency within the epiphysis, which is the epiphyseal fracture in the sagittal plane. Notice also that the medial epiphysis is already closed, while the lateral portion is still open(blue arrows). We have to assume that there is an epiphysiolysis of this lateral portion. Here another example. There is only a small metaphyseal fragment, which is usually the case (red arrow). The fracture through the epiphysis is indicated by the blue arrow.
Maisonneuve fracture:
In 1840 Maisonneuve described a frature of the proximal shaft of the fibula, which was caused by exorotation force applied to the ankle. It is a high Weber C fracture. These fractures are easily overlooked because the patients rarely complain of pain in the region of the proximal fibula, since the ankle is most painful. There are three situations in which we should suspect a high Weber C or Maisonneuve fracture: Isolated fracture of the medial malleolus According to Lauge-Hansen this is the first stage of a pronation exorotation injury, which results in a Weber C fracture. So we have to look for higher stages. The injury can continue to the following: In all these subsequent stages, purely ligamentous injury will not be visible on the radiographs of the ankle. So even in a Weber C stage 4 sometimes only a fracture of the medial malleolus will be visible. In the illustration we see the fractures and ligamentous injury on the left and the resulting x-rays on the right. Isolated fracture of the posterior malleolus Truely isolated fractures of the posterior malleolus are very uncommon. Most fractures of the posterior malleolus are part of a complex ankle injury, either Weber B or Weber C. A Weber B fracture is easily detected because of the characteristic oblique fracture. So if there is a tertiu sfracture and no sign of a Weber B fracture, then we have to start looking for a high Weber C fracture. In that case we have the following combination: An isolated tertius fracture on the ankle radiographs indicates the presence of an unstable ankle injury. Any medial painful swelling or hematoma Normal radiographs do not rule out a Weber C fracture. We may have the following combination: Example 1 On the left images of a patient with a hematoma on the medial side. We can exclude a Weber A or B fracture, because we see no fracture. A high Weber C is still a possibility, i.e.
    + medial ligament rupture
    + high fibular fracture
    + posterior syndesmosis rupture. Additional radiographs of the lower leg were taken and demonstrated a high fibular fracture, also known as Maisonneuve fracture.
* Final report Weber C stage 4, i.e. medial collateral ligamentous rupture, rupture of the anterior syndesmosis, high fibular fracture and probably a rupture of the posterior syndesmosis. Teaching point No fracture on the radiographs of the ankle does not exclude an unstable ankle injury This case demonstrates that there can be an unstable ankle injury that needs surgery even when the radiographs of the ankle do not show a fracture. In any patient with an ankle injury you should always ask yourself the question......can I exclude a high Weber C fracture or do I need additional imaging. Example 2 There is a fracture of the posterior malleolus. Classification according to Weber is not possible. An isolated fracture of the posterior malleolus is uncommon, but as part of a supination exorotation (Weber B) or pronation exorotation injury (Weber C) it is quite common. So we have to re-examine the films to look for signs of a Weber B or C fracture. No sign of an oblique fracture of the lateral malleolus, so we can exclude a Weber B fracture. There is still the possibility of a Weber C fracture, i.e. medial rupture or avulsion, high fibular fracture and finally a posterior malleolar fracture. Now we notice the subtle avulsion of the medial malleolus (red arrow). Additional radiographs of the lower extremity demonstrate a high fibular fracture (blue arrow).
* Final report Weber C stage 4. Example 3 In this case no fracture is seen, but only soft tissue swelling on the medial side. In such a case, you have to rule out a Maisonneuve fracture, which is a high Weber C fracture. Additional x-rays of the lower leg were taken. There is a high fibula fracture.
Tillaux fracture:
External rotation injury of the ankle is the most common ankle injury and can lead to a Weber B or Weber C fracture. One of the first stages in this injury is rupture of the anterior tibiofibular ligament (or anterior syndesmosis). Less frequently it leads to an avulsion of the anterolateral tibial epiphysis. Whenever you see such a fracture, you have to look for higher stages of this exorotation injury. The x-ray shows a subtle Tillaux fracture, which is better appreciated on the CT-images. Study these images carefully and remember the stages of an exorotation injury. What is going on here? There is a Tillaux fracture due to avulsion of the anterolateral part of the distal tibia by the anterior syndesmosis. This can be a stage 2 of a Weber C fracture. Stage 1 is rupture of the medial collateral ligaments and stage 3 is a fibula fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. So now we start looking for stage 4, which is rupture or avulsion of the posterior syndesmosis. Do you now see the tertius fracture on the axial CT-image? This patient has an unstable ankle injury and a syndesmotic screw needs to be inserted. Stages of exorotation injuries of the ankle Another Tillaux in a patient with a strange combination of findings. There is an avulsion of the lateral malleolus, a Tillaux and a medial malleolar fracture.
